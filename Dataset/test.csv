"I'm only using 4 stars for now, but will update after I use it snow skiing [intended use] in a few weeks.  I was looking for a ""practical"" clip-on watch that I could use snow skiing, to attach to an external zipper pull [so I could check the time without having to mess with my jacket sleeve].  My husband ordered it for me.  Took it on a trial run biking the other day and had it clipped to my vest pocket zipper pull.  SO FAR, I LIKE IT!  It's just a tad larger [diameter] than I would like, but it's light-weight, not bulky, and lies flat.  My biggest fear was that the numbers would be hard to see [old-lady eyes], but I could read it just fine even looking through sunglasses.  The only issue was with the little seal ring -- it took some patience to get it re-seated.  Also, I replaced the standard carabiner that comes with it -- I prefer the small, ""S"" carabiners.  I'll update this review after I ski with it.

Edit:  OK, so 5 stars.  It worked great as a time-piece/zipper pull for skiing!  The size was an advantage as I could easily grab it with ski gloves on.  Sometimes a button would get pushed accidently which put it in another mode, but easily fixed -- had to take ski gloves off, though, to fix it as they were too bulky to use for pushing buttons.  No problems at all with the low temps.  Good visibility.  Sorry, but I didn't use any of the other functions -- was only interested in the watch.",5.0,0

"This movie is unfortunately different from the book as others have detailed.  For myself, I found that key Christian symbolism (the purpose of these stories) was removed, and in its place is far too much emphasis on a statement from Aslan that things never happen the same way twice.  Beyond having no great meaning, ironically, the scene occurs twice, with Aslan saying the same thing twice about things not happening the same way twice.  Worthless.  Where is the emphasis on Nikabrik's disbelief in the Narnians' tales of a savior, and where is the emphasis on the faith of Caspian, Cornelius, and Trufflehunter in a savior that lived many years ago who not only died but lived again and will return?  Their dialogue should have been the highlight of the film as it was for me in the book.

Incidentally, who else hated the repeated nauseating Reepicheep jokes?  ""You're a mouse!!""  Ugh.  They ruined such a great character.  But there are too many complaints about this film to list them all.

I intend to own the version of The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe from the same series.  I was so pleased with its faithfulness to the novel, and I looked forward to seeing the other books adapted. However, despite the good things they did in Prince Caspian, overall it was too disappointing to watch again, and I have no desire to watch The Voyage of the Dawn Treader.",1.0,0

"I mildly enjoyed Last Licks, but none of the subsequent books in this series have come up to the very first one -- The Big Kitty.  The charm of this book, and both of the other books in the series, are the sections where Shadow, the cat, is narrating.  Ms. Donally does know cats -- I will concede that.  She has not made Shadow a super, magical cat with human intelligence.  He's just a cat, with cat-like concerns about food, hunting, and female cats!  The mystery in Last Licks is so-so, and I wasn't sure about the culprit until the end.  But, character development is sadly lacking.  There isn't that spark between Sunny and her cop boyfriend that is so well done by Sofie Kelly in her Magical Cats mysteries.  Unless Ms. Donally picks up the pace, I don't think I will pay to read any more in this series.",3.0,0

"I Was Looking For -
1) Large cavity satchel to carry paperwork when traveling overseas  2)  locking system  3) sturdy and lightweight

PROS  -  Locking system to keep others from getting in main compartment.  Lightweight and feels like sturdy material.  Strong straps with wire running through it.  Nice compartments as described by company.
Front pocket not very deep.  It is the length and depth of a boarding pass.  You can definitely fit other small objects in there as well.  It works.

CONS
1)  was expecting the bag cavity/opening to be larger but it wasn't, disappointing.  With the purse measuring 13"" at THE BOTTOM of the bag, THE TOP opening measures at 9 3/4"".  It does not open wide enough to slip in an 8X11"" paper/documents.  With the top not opening wide, this makes it restrictive to access things and harder to see into the bag. I have small hands and it's still awkward getting my hands in there.
2)  The lock and latch needs to be on the opposite side so it is in front of your body so you are not reaching behind you in an awkward movement to unlatch the purse.  I will be wearing this bag backwards with the latch in front for easy access.
3)  average plastic zipper, not a heavy duty kind of quality.

OVERALL -  I will be keeping the bag because I paid $25.00.  It's worth that at the top end but I would not pay more then that. If I did, I would have returned it.

I will use the bag as a day travel purse in crowded cities. If you are not opening it much, It will work great as a day carry bag for sure.",4.0,0

"I bought this hat to wear on a three-day stay at the Western Southern Tennis Tournament in Mason, Ohio.  It performed beautifully through sunny, rainy, and sometimes very windy weather.  Good thing for the chin strap because you would not want the hat to blow off while sitting up high in the stadium seats.  I noticed other tennis enthusiasts had similar OR hats, but I was very pleased with mine and glad I purchased it online.  And it's a good thing the hat can be put into a washing machine because it did get a little dirty after three days of wear.  The best feature of the hat is that the back extends down far enough to cover the neck and keep it from being burned by the sun.  The adjustable chin strap and the toggle at the back allow you to get a fit exactly to your head size that is comfortable and stylish at the same time.",5.0,0

"I have the original game which I love and I thought that I'd buy the other continents for 2 reasons:
1.  others collect all the games so there must be some reason to want more of basically the same game.
2.  I wanted to use it to help my son learn the main places in africa (we used the original one to learn where main towns in the US/Canada were)
and my opinion?
re: reason #1...There is one added dimension, which is fun, and of course a different map that has a lot of cities that I'm unfamiliar with so it really twisted my brain, which is good, I guess.  But overall, I'm not sick of the first game enough to really need a second similar one yet.  If I was in the mood for ticket to ride, I would have just as happily played the first one....
re: reason #2...Although my son over time might become more familiar with some important cities in africa over time and have a basic idea where they would be, I feel that knowing which country they are in is very important and the lines showing the different countries are not there.  Also, many of the cities are ones that I don't feel he NEEDS to know, and finally, it's only the bottom half of the continent.

end opinion: I like the game but wish that I would not have spent so much money on a game that didn't really fulfill my needs.  I wish that it was all of africa, with countries identified, and only the most widely known cities in all of africa.",4.0,0
"This was another mesmerising book about Shifter Grove and I thoroughly enjoyed the story;  it was a pleasure to read.  Danni feels betrayed by her boyfriend Taylor and moves to Shifter Grove, where it not only calls to her, but she is able to realise her dream.  Taylor doesnt give up though  he is relentless in his pursuit.  Danni, meanwhile, finds trust, friendship and love in Shifter Grove.  Rhett and Rush have returned home; they are billionaires but know that money cannot buy happiness.  They have made a promise to their father, and there is no way they can go back on this, irrespective of the consequences.  Danni has forgotten what it is like to date or how to get to know someone again after Taylor, but fate plays a hand although it is not all plane sailing.

"I have the biggest smile on my face after reading this book; it's the stuff your dream romance is made of.  It's honest, mature, sexy, relevant, engaging and most importantly its romantic; swoon worthy.

I started this book ready to resist liking Arden.  While she is still not my favorite character in this series, the author did a phenomenal job making her softer and vulnerable while staying true to her ""real' personality.  I certainly understood her better by the end of the book and look forward to the author unveiling the rest of her complicated layers. I think the good doctor is just what she needed in more ways than one.

The author gives us a great chance to catch up with all of your favorite couples from the previous two stories;  Ari/Riely, Athena/Denali and Daynesha/Cesar.  What I really enjoyed and respected the most was the way these couples dealt with conflict when it arose, textbook for classy and mature adults.  This book is as much about this cast of friends as it is learning more about Arden and what she needed most in her life.  You simply cannot read this book and not wish you were part of this group's inner circle.

My favorite line in the book is delivered by my favorite man in this series, Cesar, he tells Athena ""You are the diamond Dee has been longing to treasure"".

This book is well written with its depth and characterization. The drama is not overdone (thank you) and the pace is perfect.  I feel as though I know this group of friends.

"The stainless steel is easy to disassemble and clean; it does not absorb bacteria like plastics.  I chose this one because stainless steel is healthier than plastics, and it looks better in my kitchen - like a sculptured water fountain.

After running it for the first time, after a few rotations of water, any residual rubber or machine smells will be gone, as the first reviewer/most helpful reviewer mentioned.

Simple Maintenance is key:

If the motor and pump are disassembled and cleaned properly, you won't need to replace them; you'll only need to replace filters, which are reasonably priced and well worth it.
If you don't clean the motor and  pump well enough or often enough, you will have to purchase a new motor and pump from the Pioneer Pet website (at least they sell it separately, though it's pricey enough to make you think about getting a second fountain.  Maintenance is key to getting 5 star use of this product and keeping its economic value.)

My cat has allergies and urinary tract infection tendencies; water is so important for her to prevent these issues.  She drinks the most from this fountain, laying next to it and sopping it up for minutes, than she ever did from the 2 plastic ones we had before (and eventually stopped working).  This fountain has helped keep her healthy, she's so hydrated.

It's very quiet and will only get noisy if you let the water level fall below the motor's line.  The noisiness is a sound of the motor's slow death - keep that water filled.

Take care of this product (and it doesn't take much; there are easy instructions, even online videos), and your pet will love you for it.  We've had this fountain 2 years this spring. She looks at me with ""I love you"" after I gave it to her the first time, and after I clean it (every week the bowl @ 5 mins, every month all parts @20 mins).  We both love this fountain. 5 Stars.",5.0,0

"I was searching for a backpack to take my dog with me on bike rides. This one was more expensive than the other options, but it is well worth it. The sports sack is so well made - substantial canvas fabric, mesh air vents for those hot days, and two pockets for stashing keys and leash and things. Plus my boy loves it!  At first he wasn't thrilled about being stuffed into it, but now he gets all excited when I put it down on the floor because he loves coming along in my rides. He is always very content and fascinated by the scenery.

To put him in it, I place the unzipped sack on the floor and insert one paw into the appropriate leg opening. Then I grab his other leg and start to lift, which causes him to put weight on the first leg so I can pull the sack up on that side. Then I insert his second leg and clip the bag behind his neck. Next I lift and place his back legs, one at a time, into the sack, and after that I gently press on his rump to get him to sit down inside it. Finally I zip him up and lift him up to settle him down into the bag. Putting it in myself is the trickiest part, but I've gotten the hang of it after using it so much. I find it actually pretty comfortable to wear. It helps to cinch the straps and being the bag high up on my back.

For the fit, my boy is a 15 pound miniature poodle, long and lanky for his weight. I measured him according to the manufacturer's instructions, and his length was 17 inches, exactly on the borderline between small and medium. So I got a medium, and while it is roomy it doesn't seem too large. I haven't gotten the booster pad.

Edward Lengel's primary focus in this book isn't so much the myths themselves, but their place in American lore and, more importantly, the reasons behind their origination.  While we all know the ""chopping down the cherry tree"" story is whole-cloth fiction, you'd be surprised at some of the real sources of George Washington quotes and lore that Lengel exposes.

While some were innocent enough embellishments upon actual events or wholly made-up fiction, the reasons behind others are far from innocent.  Whether used for the villification of Washington and the American Experiment OR to further the ends of the idea that America is a ""just cause,"" Lengel delves into the prevelance of the mythology in todays world.

Even after exhaustive publication of authenticated writings directly from the hand of George Washington, many of the myths retain their seeming veracity.  Whether taken from forged writings of George Washington or from the imagination of biographers, admirers or detractors, you'd be surprised by the quoatation of these stories in todays modern era--usually to serve modern political ends.

While Lengel seemed to make no conclusion as to what to do about this problem, it left this reader with one thought in mind:  Before you tell any story--good or bad--or attribute any quotation to George Washington, make sure YOU do your own research and verify its sourcing.  As to the legends?  Maybe they DO serve a purpose and DO have a place in American society. If not for some of them, it might be kind of hard to inspire the American people and keep ol' G.W. ""..first in the hearts of his countrymen.""

I give this book FOUR STARS.  Well worth the read if you have even a passing interest in discovering the REAL George Washington.  Although, that will require additional careful research on your part, you'll at least have a new found suspicion for stories and qoutes being bandied about today!",4.0,0
The harness is great.  We have a medium-size dog who is a very active and aggressive chewer.  This harness is a must have for her.  She is very active and it keeps her safe and in good shape.  I wish it was stronger.  The harness also allows us to place our dogs feet on the harness and be able to adjust the size of the leash.  It does not have a collar that is on the same level as the harness itself.  The harness is also very easy to open.  I would definitely recommend it.  I have a 15,4.0,1

"A great little spice rack.  We installed ours behind a cabinet door and it works well.  We don't have matching spice canisters, but the majority of our spices are from Walmart & Aldi...and they fit just fine as they are.  It comes with 2 sets of screws.  One bag contains screws with plastic anchors for drywall installation, the other set comes with short, thick screws for wood installation.  First 2 screws went in with ease, but the third screw busted only 3/4 of the way in..the head broke right off!  I know I didn't ""over-tighten"" because the screw wasn't even in all the way!

"I have switched my dog from a mix of hills science diet and Rachel ray grain free nutrish (salmon)  to this over the past week.  He is a growing Bassett hound, 10 mo;  I know not everyone would consider this a large breed because  he is short, but I know that his breed can get up to 70 pounds full-grown.  He seems to like  The flavor so far, but he is not a terribly picky eater. I have been transitioning him  slowly on a graduated mix;  I have noticed that his stools, while still formed, have been a lot softer on the Iams mix.  Some of this I realize has to do with any kind of dietary change,  so I will wait a little longer before giving my final opinion on that. This product lost only one star because the grain size makes this food a little harder to eat than others (including Eukanuba large breed, which he has tried before).  Other than that, it is a good product at a fair price and keeping my dog nourished at his high activity level.

Update:  dog still likes it and his poops are nice and firm, but the problem is that the grain size is so large, it is clogging my auto feeder. For that reason alone, I cannot buy it again.",4.0,0

"Bass is muddy but acceptable in a speaker set in this price range.  If you can recall to take extreme care when assembling, disassembling, or moving this speaker set, and if you're not looking for high fidelity, this is probably a perfectly fine purchase.

My wife moved the woofer to make room while vacuuming and bumped the back of the woofer against the wall.  This broke the tweeter audio connector internally, making it so that I had to wiggle the tweeter connector cable in order to make a connection - and high volumes would shake it loose almost immediately.

Being only invested for $40 and being fairly certain the connector was probably wired separately from the circuit board, I decided to disassemble the woofer and attempt a repair.  I quickly discovered that every seam and component are glued into place - even those which are (also) screwed-down.  I also then discovered that the audio connector is part of the circuit board rather than being a separate lead-out connector.  The repair was beyond my soldering skills and though I could have taken it to a repair shop, the cost of doing so would have exceeded the purchase price of a new speaker set.",2.0,0
"This is based on the Iain Sinclair credit card knife. These ones however are generic and have no brands imprinted on them. I do not have an authentic Iain Sinclair knife to compare these with, so I'll go stag with this review and give you the raw details and ONLY this product.

I ordered these on Amazon from China in a bulk package of 4 for about $5 as favors for friends. Now in its packaging, already I notice the plastic parts wobble... because they are extremely thing. The cards measures 5 3/4 inch by a little more than 2 inches. They're easy to figure out how the use despite the fact that they do not come with instructions. There is a safety wheel that needs to be turned with a fingernail so that the blade can pop out. After you fold the blade back along the cutout, the other two flaps of the card fold together to form the handle. They will not pop out unless you force them apart.

The knife itself is about half a millimeter (mm) thick. This would not be applicable for any defense situation, This would however come handy with opening letters and tapes  (but not bubble wrapped packages or cardboard boxing). The entire knife is not as a solid as an actual switchblade or letter opener and flops around quite flimsily.

The folded card will fit in most wallets where credit/gift/debit/reward cards usually go. The card is lightweight and will take no more than 6-7 seconds for an average person to assemble.

Great novelty item, but not very applicable. I may buy the original Iain Sinclair model to compare, but if there are for your collection or as favors to friends, you might as well go for it, for the great price these are offered.",3.0,0

"I liked it. I didn't love it.

After finishing this book, I tried to determine exactly what I didn't love about it. It took me a moment to put my finger on it. There was an entertaining main character, lots of action, some cool magic, and even a bit of romance. I think the problem was that I didn't connect with the main character.

Harry was so...I don't know. And that's the point. The book is written in Harry's first-person point-of-view, and Harry repeatedly reminds the reader that he is a skilled wizard. He also reminds the reader, on a number of occasions, that those who are privileged to see into his soul are generally shocked or terrified at what they see. Through Harry's accomplishments, I saw that Harry is indeed a skilled wizard. But I never saw what was inside his soul. I want to know about his dark past. I want to know Harry.

On a couple of occasions in the book, Harry claims to struggle with his choices. He wants to do the right thing, but the power of his magic draws him toward darker things. I know about these struggles because Harry told me so explicitly. Never once I did I actually see him make so much as a questionable decision. He did the right thing; he fought for good. So all the rambling in his head about his dark past and about temptation was lost on me. I saw no inner turmoil. I saw only a good guy skilled in magic attempting to fight a powerful, power-hungry evil guy.

Without a backstory, this is a typical good versus evil book. So it didn't blow me away. I will read the second book in this series though, and I hope to see Harry making some tough decisions that show me the darkness he claims is inside him.",3.0,0

If you're a Miranda fan, you'll enjoy this FOX TECHNICOLOR MUSICAL.

Carmen has two colorful production numbers, the first, typical Miranda, the second and last is Carmen in a totally different appearance THAN WE HAVE SEEN IN THE PAST, a different 'short'costume than usual showing more leg...the lighting in this number is somewhat over the top...however, looks great in this pristine transfer.

"Having had to sit through the ""horror"" films that the Hollywood studios have given hideous birth to these past couple of years, I was in the mood for some good old fashioned imported hair raising terror. I had read about this film before going to see it, mostly because I had read a novel of the same title by Jeff Long which is about a terrifying cave exploration gone wrong, but this movie directed by Neil Marshall is a completely different story although similar in its originality. I dragged my husband to see this last night, promising him a different experience than all the horror movies as of late. We both are sick of paltry remakes of Japanese films, and big budget stinkers that involve lots of water and hair, and rely heavily on computer generated scares , This movie is a serious monster movie for a generation without monster movies. I really missed the good old days where the baddies were flesh and bone; the stories were fresh and didn't need too much elaboration, and I had the chance to see some unknowns get massacred. This movie delivered all that to us and more, its scary but not cheesy it has unknowns which is so rare nowadays to see a fresh face in a imaginative movie. it had an awesome story line, that was full of symoblism of course but not so blatant that you were rolling your eyes and saying ""okay, cave wombs, blood, rebirth i get it"" the movie also had great effects for a 6 million dollar budget, and I left feeling like I had a refreshing adrenaline horror filled enema, cleansing all the ""the saws, the grudges, the rings, the darkwaters, etc"" out of my system.

"""Northanger Abbey"" does make a mockery of Gothic Romance.  But Jane Austen shows that you can be passionate towards fiction literature without making fiction reality.  The heroine, Catherine, learns that not everything in reality has a Gothic fiction story.  That fiction is just that.

Catherine Morland (17) goes to Bath with friends.  She then meets Henry Tilney, whom invites her to his family's home -  Northanger Abbey.  Catherine expected a Gothic Abbey to match with the novels she reads (mainly Ann Radcliffe the creator of Gothic Romance).  The comedy is that the Abbey, Henry and the Tilney's are just the opposite.  They are wealthy ""English Christians.""

There are other subtext to parody of social marriages and manners.  Jane Austen's books all have this comedic point if view.

I am very disappointed. This was a great product. My dog was a little nervous at first but it did the trick and she is a strong chewer. I would recommend it to anyone with a strong chewer. I have two very picky cats and this is the one I have tried. I love that it is made in the USA and it has a nice quality. I do like that it is not heavy duty. I do like that it is made in the USA.

"We bought this TV two weeks ago. Ordered from Onecall via Amazon. TV arrived very quickly, in fact so quickly we had to postpone delivery so that we could be home to receive. Onecall delivers via a regional carrier which dropped it off in our garage.

First impressions. TV screen is huge. The TV itself is fairly thin and weights just under 100 lbs. Although it might be obvious, don't buy this TV if you are going to be watching it from few feet away. Too close to the TV and regular cable will look fuzzy since the low resolution is magnified to a 58 inch screen. Amazing picture quality with Blu-ray without any optimization. Regular DVD and HD cable have an excellent picture as well. We are viewing it from about 12-14 feet which i think is optimal. No motion blur with action sequences.

There isn't too much glare appreciable even a sunny room in our house. The viewing angles are excellent which is one of the reasons we choose plasma over LCD.

The audio speakers are okay to good but you are better off with a surround sound system if you have it. The TV does have a faint buzzing sound that you can hear if you turn off the volume. It isn't annoying and I believe it goes away as the TV warms up.

Overall, a great TV for a reasonable price ($2099 is the lowest recently offered.) If you are looking for a large plasma, check it out.",5.0,0

"Sound quality is pretty decent for the price, but what this stands out for is ease of use. I have an LG 60LB6300 60-Inch TV and at the very least you can remove this from the box, sit it on the entertainment center below the TV, plug it and the sub in and that's it. With my TV I can send the audio wirelessly which worked well, but I chose the optical cable instead. Even with the optical cable the sound bar turns on and off automatically without exception. The sub syncs by itself, and Bluetooth worked great but I only used it when I first opened the box to hear the sound from this bar. One thing I noticed is it was recommended for 43"" and smaller tvs. This may be due to length, however I mounted it in the center of the TV with the included wall mount, and if centered properly it looks perfect. It is pretty loud as well, we usually have the volume between 15 and 25 out of 100.  I have the sub turned down and in a corner behind my couch (it just needs a wall outlet) and also sounds good.  The bar itself adjusts with the TV volume which displays on the TV when adjusted. Basically I never have to touch the sound bar or use it's remote (which is a good thing cause I haven't seen it in a month). One caveat with the wall mount is the optical cable plugs in on one side of the mount than has an opening for the wire to go into the wall on the other side. Because of this the optical cable has to be routed under the mount and is slightly visible.",5.0,0

"This was a warehouse deal item but if I bought another, I'd pay full price.  This had a scratch in it that I keep looking at over and over.  The thermos holds quite a bit of coffee for me.  This is a tall, thin thermos so it is easy to hold.  I have the teal color and it is a very nice shade.  The top screws on and has to be lined up perfectly to get this to go on and make sure you tighten it down real good or you'll get your beverage leaking out.  I usually put lids on so tight my husband cannot get them off and with this, even with tightening this down the way I usually do, it was not tight enough.  The top center has a small button to push  up or down to open or close it, that works good.  There is also a small hook inside to hold a tea bag.  I haven't used that feature yet but I will.  That is different and will come in handy.

02/23 update - I filled this up with coffee today and screwed the top on and the silver band split and there is about a 1/8 inch gap now in the top.  It seems to not cause any spill of the coffee yet, but we'll see.  Maybe this wasn't such a good deal after all.

03/08 - Another update.  This was a sale one day recently and I bought a silver one with a black top to take to work.  Do not buy the silver with the black top!  You cannot see where the opening is for the beverage to come out and I spill hot coffee on my cheek and clothing about 80 percent of the time.  Since I used this, I will probably have to make some scratch marks in the lid so I know when the opening is.  This will be better than a burned red face.",2.0,0

"If you have ever taken an exercise class that has totally kicked your butt & you are looking to get that kind of workout at home - this is it!!  When you are done you know that you just did a serious work out. It's approximately 48 minutes of constant cardio that includes an active aerobic warm up and about 6 minutes of cool down & stretching.  I am in fairly good shape although I have some weight to lose and I find this workout an excellent challenge.  If you are just starting out exercising I would think that this would be a bit too much to take on although JM does show some easier versions of some of the exercises.
A note about JM - I have to admit that I have never been a fan of hers previously.  When I would see her on the Biggest Loser she would rub me the wrong way.  However, after trying this workout I am a big fan now!  She is one awesome trainer & is able to get that across even via video.

"Devon & Georgina (Gina) are a remarkable couple. She may have a slight tendency to be a doormat, but all women tend to (at least during some stage of their lives) put everyone else before themselves. Yet Gina typically does that only for those she loves, those who love her unconditionally. Devon is an exception. Hubris is the classic flaw that may yet deny him what he most needs--a woman who will love and accept him just as he is, poverty and all.

Their struggle to escape the hurts of the past and to work through their doubts and fears enables this book to be a remarkable romance that champions the power of love. Devon is the character who really changes in this novel, and his emotional battles are the usually the most compelling. But Gina holds her own and is the perfect mate for him. Their back and forth romance is fraught with both tension and delight, and is thoroughly satisfying.

Despite a couple of minor question marks (like not signing the marriage agreement before the wedding), this is a thoroughly enjoyable read.",5.0,0

"I purchased a fixed blade Boker, and the seller sent me this by mistake. So consider this a review by a disinterested 3rd party who saw and handled it before returning it for a refund.
Unless a menacing look to a knife is all you are after, I find little else that this knife would offer. The knife is very tight and hard to deploy one- handed. The blade itself seems very cheap. Part of that is due to the fact that this knife has a chisel grind, (ground only on one side. The back side of the knife in the photo is just flat steel. No grind at all to produce an edge). One sided grind lowers production costs. Throw in the fact that 2/3 of the blade edge is curved, so you will need a curved whetstone to sharpen the blade, and you end up with get a knife that is unlikely to hold an edge long and that is difficult to maintain. I have 1 Boker knife (Arbolito) and am purchasing another, so I like their quality. Boker Plus is a low end brand for Boker with this Boker Plus knife is being made Taiwan.

"I've recently moved my old C100 to the office (3 years old and no problems) and picked the Citiz for home. Overall, it's a great looking machine that simply makes amazing espresso.

Here's my quick notes and comparison with the Essenza C100:

- The red and black have subtle differences in the spout and capsule release handle. The black has a chromed handle which makes it look a bit more classier and a different spout shape which I ended up getting. The overall build quality looks a bit nicer on the Citiz than the Essenza but I've only used it for almost two months so I can't comment on reliability but no problems yet.

- The Citiz + milk has a significant larger footprint than the compact c100. However, it does integrate the frother using one plug which is a bonus.

- The folding pedastal cup holder on the Citiz is great for my larger mugs which I had to alway tilt and hold on the Essenza which was a major annoyance.

- The new Aerocinno is amazing ... a much better improvement over the older non-plus version and worth the extra money. The foam taste is a whole lot better as far as texture goes. The only thing is that it no longer uses a clever magnetic lid to keep the extra attachment.

- Overall, the Citiz amd Essenza are equally as good as the espresso taste great with both. I could recommend the Essenza for the cheaper price, in my case track proven reliability, a smaller footprint since the Aerocinno is separate and can be stored away. But for some reason, I'm just drawn to the look and ""presence"" of the Citiz. It's something that looks subtly classy in the kitchen and makes an easy process of making a cappuccino that much more enjoyable.",5.0,0

"Ordained Irreverence is part of a series of four Elmo Jenkins books.  I have devoured all of them.  They are the greatest.  While I am not part of the inner circle of the church politic, that is to say I don't get paid for what I do in the church, I know what transpires and Moody catches the spirit of the church with such good natured delight and pleasure that you can't help but love him and overlook the obvious shortcomings of those who work within the Body of Christ.  We are human and how God ever made us the holder of His way forward in the world has got to be one of the great mysteries of the age.  Moody captures that conundrum with good nature and good will.  I highly commend all four of these Elmo Jenkins books.  They are worth your eye sight.",5.0,0

This staple gun is easy to assemble and the finish is good.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the plastic parts are too small to fit into the jaws.

I had to order a second set of jaws from another gun store for the same reason.  I am considering purchasing another brand,5.0,1
"Any single Justice League animated TV episode makes this film look like the Superfriends from the 1970's, and there simply is no excuse.  Animation studios with amazing talent are everywhere, and Marvel certainly has enough cash after successes like the Spiderman and X-Men films.  Though they tried to put in elements from the brilliantly developed characters in the Ultimates comic series, each scene was rushed, giving no time for emotional involvement.  That, combined with chunky animation, leaves you with little ability to suspend your disbelief and really feel for these characters.

The animation of Giant Man's growth was unimpressive, when it should have been imposing and awe striking.  Wasp's growth, having her wings disappear into nothing only after she's fully grown shows a ridiculously poor understanding by the animators and directors of how her power is supposed to work.

Outside of the animation itself are the pacing, directing and editing of this film.  Each segue was hard and roughly paced.  Camera angles were sharp and characters badly proportioned within them-possibly in an attempt to be stylized.  Scenes were poorly framed.  Character dialogue was unrealistically fast and either emotionally shallow or over the top.  The best voice actor in the film was Andre Ware as Nick Fury, but he's had a lot of experience in the DC animated universe, and it's apparent that experience helped him here.

Marvel studios haven't shown an increase in technical or storytelling skill from the Spider Friends, Spiderwoman or original X-Men animated series in any way and it's unfortunate, because with Mark Millar's incredible storytelling and Bryan Hitch's innovative character design, this could have launched a whole new era for Marvel animation.

I even tried to give this a 2 star rating, just for seeing these characters on the screen, but I can't bring myself to do it.  JLU and the DC animated universe have raised the bar on both storytelling and animation quality.

Step up to the plate, Marvel.  Play time's over.",1.0,0

"I bought this kennel to use on my cat and it is a nice size for him. It is so small that it is a bit difficult to put on, so it is not easy to slip it on.

I like that it is so easy to put on and take off. The only thing I would change is that I put it in a larger size box and put it in a closet where it would be easier for me to get it off. I would definitely recommend this to anyone. This is a great product for getting your dog to go in and out of the crate. I have a 10 year old Lab and he is not quite as aggressive as I thought he would be. He is very active and has not gotten into fights with other people.

It made a change to see a male character like that. These two characters are great on their own but together they really smoulder. They show a united front and both speak their mind. The love scenes weren't particularly steamy, I prefer a bit more detail but I don't think that would have suited this book. The plot was good and very well written.

"I just received my feeders. I bought the 2 pack on Amazon. I just set it up so I'll update my review later once I've had it a while.

But for now, here are my observations. I have 5 cats. I find it hard to leave them for extended periods because it's too much for someone to scoop the litter and feed them etc. I boarded them once last summer. But it's not cheap and they are so trqumatized. I wanted to be able to go away for least a couple days. So I researched automatic feeders. I read all the reviews and some are very good some had issues. For this price for two, I decided to give it a shot...

Sturdiness: I real the instructions and set it up. I attempted to lift it by the lid just to test the sturdiness a little and it held nicely. I'm sure rowdy animals can get around that ... oh well.

Programming: Just like a clock, read the directions. Press buttons. It was easy. To test it, I put 5 cups in the hopper. And choose to dispense 1 cup at feeding.

Portion dispensed: After it dispensed, I measured the amount. It actually dispensed about 3/4 cup instead of a full cup. But I've heard it sometimes releases 1/4 less the first time it rotates. So I'll see next time.

Sound: I was testing it so I stood right by it when it went off. Only sound I heard was the kibble dropping into the bowl. No loud grinding at all.

I am going to set the other one up and test them a few times and I'll update my review. So far so good...

Update: So I've had it a couple days now and it is dispensing what it says it will. Again, the only it makes is the food hitting the bowl. Cats were surprised the first time it did it while they were next to it. But now it doesn't bother them. So far, it's been a great purchase.",4.0,0

It takes less than a minute tops to be throughly mixed and water is absorbed. The cats do like it dry too but I rather have water in it to give them more moisture in their diet as they eat Orijen dry cat food.

"This is my first Super Tinker after using up 2 Tinkers and a couple of others. I'm a mechanic and general tinkerer and very hard on knives. The standard Tinker is nice and light and thin, but I found myself missing the scissors and went for this after finally destroying my last Tinker (abuse - my fault). The Super is not much larger than the Tinker, but I wouldn't keep either loose in my pocket for long. I find hanging them in my pocket from a key ring/belt clip saves my clothing and makes it harder to lose the knife.
  These knives are incredibly useful as a mini tool kit. I use the screwdrivers constantly, the awl makes a great drill, and the blades hold an edge pretty well. I often use the tweezers for removing splinters and deer ticks. It takes a substantial amount of force to break these knives (I figured out how much).

"I purchases these earphones for $45 and they seem to be currently priced at $40-50.  I have them for about three weeks and I use them for walking, running, weight lifting, and riding the bus.

Pros:
For working out, these works pretty well.  Maybe it is the shape of my ears, but these earphones stay snug in my ear, and I do not have an issue with them falling out.  I do both jogging outdoors, and I run sprints on treadmill on an include, 10 incline and 10 mph.  Other activities like jump rope, cycling (casual), and weights, also do not cause an issue with them falling out.

They do a decent job of blocking out exterior sound.  I ride the bus to work and it can drown out a lot of the noise.  It does have CVC Active Noise Cancelling, but it is hard to tell how well it works if you cannot shut it on and off.

Cons:
If they are in my ears for 2 hours or longer, they tend to become uncomfortable.  This is fine for me as my workouts are usually an hour or less and I did not buy these to use around the house.  I did try them around the house which is how I discovered they are uncomfortable after a couple of hours of non stop use.

The connection could be better.  Even if my iphone is in my pocket, it sometimes starts skipping and I have to restart the headphones.

While these earphones are not perfect, I think they do a good job for the price.  For less than 50 dollars and being wireless, I think they are a decent value.  I am curious about some of more pricier brands that are between 100-200 dollars.",4.0,0

"I usually wear a size 36 x 34 in all my jeans regardless of brand, so I ordered accordingly for the Silver Zac jeans. While trying to find my size, I discovered that Silver's official website offers a generic sizing chart, but trying to estimate my exact size was difficult based on the limited information. Anyway, my new 36 x 34 Silver jeans arrived from Amazon and were exactly what I had in mind in terms of color and style. (These jeans look exactly as they do in the pictures on Amazon). However, I immediately noticed after trying them on that these jeans were way too large on me--in the waist, thigh, and leg. I checked the tag and noticed that the jeans are made from 99% cotton and 1% elastane, which means there is a slight amount of stretch in the material. Not necessarily a bad thing, but it certainly made the jeans feel overly baggy. I ordered another pair exactly like the first, but in size 34 x 34. Amazon sent the replacement pair in a scant three days! The new jeans fit perfectly, look great, and are not too tight. Also, the inseam length (34) was appropriate with other 34 inseamed jeans that I wear. If you are looking for a pair of trendy jeans, these are perfect. Just make sure to go down one full size in order to achieve the optimal fit.",4.0,0

"I own a 2005 Cadillac CTS with a Bose system. If I were Bose, I would be ashamed to put my name on it as the factory speakers suck so badly. I replaced the sub with a Kicker and amp and the front door speakers with a pair of Infinity reference 6032cf's I got from Amazon. I went with these as they are 2 ohm just as the system speakers are.

These speakers are incredible! With the sub dialed in to my base level preference the sound system now sounds like it should have with the name BOSE on it.

These speakers are not meant to be a replacement base speaker, however they do an admirable job with it. The two position (0db - 3db)tweeter is phenomenal and the mids are so clear! Since I'm not trying to explode my kidneys or rock the car next to me with too much volume, I am more than pleased with Infinity.

A word of caution here... the Infinity site says that the rear door speakers for the first generation CTS are 6.5""... Do NOT believe it. the rears are 5.25""... I had to return one set 6.5's and I'm waiting for the 5.25's to arrive so I can finish the install.

Everybody holds and uses the same tool differently.  I didn't really like the feel of the tool in my hand.  It just doesn't have a comfortable quality feel.

I had a long skirt, but I wanted stockings longer than knee-highs just to be on the safe side.  So I figured I would try these.

These fit me pretty well.  I am right in that height/weight combination where I can wear either A or B sized pantyhose, and I'm a size 8 or medium in most US-sized pants and skirts.  They had a slight reinforced toe, which I appreciate, as I tend to get runs in pantyhose/stockings/etc.

These had no holes or runs in them and I did not damage them when I put them on.  This is a big plus since I tend to ruin a lot of garments of this type.  These seemed particularly sturdy to me.  They stayed up.  The silicone part is inside the lace at the top and it is clear so it will not show, even if you intend for the tops of these to show (I'm hiding mine well under my skirt, but the option is there for you if you want it).

There were a few loose threads at the top but they weren't terribly noticeable.  In the end, because these fit and seemed really sturdy, I'm quite happy with them.  You can be practical with them if you want, too, if your skirt is long enough, or you can show off the tops for a different look.

"When Mark Wahlberg openly implies the mistake he made in taking on the role he played in this film, you know there's a serious problem.

M. Night Shyamalan is a man who clearly needs to redeem himself. ""The Sixth Sense"" was remarkable, ""Unbreakable"" was absolutely incredible, and ""Signs"" was consistently engaging. Everything after those three have been total train-wrecks. I absolutely did not like ""The Village,"" and I thought ""Lady In The Water"" was just about the very worst thing I'd ever seen put to film. But ""The Happening?"" Well, let's just say I was less than thrilled.

An unknown airborne virus that drives common everyday people to inexplicably commit suicide. Think of what could be done with an idea like that! So much more could have been explored on this theme, and yet all we're left with is Wahlberg, John Leguizamo and several other ragtag survivors who do nothing but flee from one random spot to another in some lame attempt to outrun a force they can't even see! Sorry, I guess I was just expecting something a bit more substantial! Shyamalan certainly has it within him to deliver far more interesting stories. But what we get with this is something prone to a rare, substandard dud from ""The Twilight Zone.""

All I can say is, I'm glad I only paid one dollar to rent this at a redbox. Even that, I feel, was too much money.

I really do admire and respect the talent M. Night Shyamalan has proven to possess by virtue of his earlier work. But he is in dire need of getting his act together. Three bombs in a row does not bode well for any director's future in the industry.

To any potential viewers, be forewarned. There's not much of anything ""happening"" throughout this entire movie.",2.0,0

"I wear a 8.5 US (41.5 UK) in Chuck Taylors and Merrills. The La Sportiva fits the same, but is tighter around the middle of the foot. This is as expected as this is my third pair of shoes from La Sportiva. The shoes are very comfortable, and what you'd expect from a hiking shoe. The lacing system is unique and incorporates a lace that goes around the back of the shoe and is tightened when you cinch up the top laces. That makes the show a bit more snug. If you need a wide shoe, I wouldn't recommend these. If you like a snug, secure fit and have an average-width foot, these are great. In my past experience La Sportiva are virtually indestructible. I still have my original two pair but because the sole lugs are worn down use them only for yard work and dock underwater work.

"I've had this Lunchbots for over a year now.  Overall, it's been a decent container, though only useful for dry goods.  My original intent was to purchase an 'heirloom' lunchbox that was completely foodsafe -- what better choice for that than stainless steel, right?

So anyway, over a year later, the paint regularly chips off.  Each day, there are some paint flakes to be found everyhwere -- in the tote bag I use to carry this container, on the rim, and if I'm not careful, in my food.

Given the times we live in, and that there's no way for me to know for certain whether there's lead, cadmium, or other toxics in the paint, this will soon go into the trash.

In fact, that's why I'm on Amazon today -- I came shopping for a 100% stainless steel replacement.  After seeing this pop up in the search, I thought I'd at least help others by sharing my experience.

Someone did suggest that Lunchbots was extremely customer-service oriented, and would replace the lids -- no questions asked.  That was not my experience at all.  I wrote to customer service, and got a standard 'stock' response back which suggested the product is no longer under warranty and this was considered normal 'wear and tear' -- but that I could buy some replacement lids (which were also painted) if I wanted to, at my expense.

(apparently this comes with a one year warranty, so that's all the product is guaranteed for)

So much for quality and so much for manufacturer product support.

Seriously -- what's the point of spending some $20 for a stainless steel item if it won't last much longer than a year?

"I owned several knives including Gerber, Buck, Smith and Wesson, and I've got to say, this Kershaw knife is a great surprise. The feel of this knife is so sturdy, I love the weight distribution and the solid, yet silky smooth action of the blade on its hinge. I can flip this knife open easily with a flick of my wrist due to its weight.

The steel is very interesting. I love the two types of steel fused together with copper...one stronger and harder to provide the a good base to attach the softer, more easily sharpened edge piece...I don't know how operationally effective it will turn out to be in the long run but the concept is great and so far I've had no problems.

WARNING: IF LEFT WITH MOISTURE THIS BLADE WILL RUST. DUE TO THE MATERIALS USED THE BLADE WILL DEVELOP RUST IF LEFT UN-OILED FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME IN DAMP AREAS. IF YOU WANT TO PRESERVE THE QUALITY BE SURE TO STORE THE KNIFE WITH A LIGHT SHEEN OF OIL ON IT.

The above is mentioned in the knife manual that comes in the package but it is not mentioned in the product details, which it probably should be. Luckily I read the directions when they're provided so I will be able to prevent rust on this beautiful knife.

Highly recommended although I would imagine there are probably better knives to purchase if you are going to be abusing this knife. I just find it much too attractive of a knife to risk scratching, chipping, or scuffing it.",5.0,0

"The Bloco product consists of a few cutout sheets of foam, as well as some connectors. I'll grant that it's clever, and the dragons are fairly neat when fully constructed. That being said, I'm not a huge fan. First of all, there are a large number of pieces - 230 doesn't seem like that much, but many of them are small and even hard to find. My 6 year old was overwhelmed, so I had to piece the things together. Moreover, I suspect that the instruction sheet would be a bit much for a 10 year old, working alone to interpret - let alone a 6 year old. If you look at the picture of the kids on the Bloco page, they still have their baby teeth - so they're marketing to younger kids. The foam itself is, by and large, pretty thick and durable, although there are a couple sheets of thinner form that easily tears as well. In some cases, however, removing the smaller foam holes and pieces can be difficult. Regardless, separating the pieces in the foam sheets took a good amount of effort, and assembling both dragons took around 90 minutes - for an adult. The toy itself was OK. If your child likes Legos they'll probably like this as well. In my case, once the novelty of the newly-built dragons wore off, the toy was largely forgotten. So while the Bloco Dragons are offered at a good price, and some kids will love them, I can't give them an unqualified ""thumbs up.",3.0,0

"Short, Sexy and Steamy&iexcl;K&iexcl;K&iexcl;K&iexcl;K&iexcl;K.  MY THREE FAVORITE COLORS!

Sean Whitcomb is up for a promotion at his law firm, the test is a dinner for the bosses with his partner to prove his family values. Sean could burn water, but his ex lover Isaiah is a world class chef, so he calls in a favor. Isaiah Waterston has never gotten over the betrayal he felt when Sean left him to pursue his career ten years ago. So when Sean asks him to pretend to be his lover for the weekend and cook a meal for the bosses, Isaiah is hesitant. He makes an assanine comment about topping Sean in exchange for his help, and immediately regrets it when Sean agrees.

Dinner is a huge success as is dessert which consist of Sean laid out naked on the dining room table for Isaiah&iexcl;s tasty treat. The two spend a whirlwind, sex filled weekend together and Sean is more than eager to make his pasts mistakes right. But Isaiah is not buying it and leaves while Sean sleeps and to add salt to the wound, he doesn&iexcl;t return his texts or calls. Can Sean convince Isaiah that he still loves him, he&iexcl;s changed and he&iexcl;d give up everything he&iexcl;s worked ten years to build for another chance with him? Or was one last hoorah all Isaiah was in this for?

I have a new found fascination with interracial M/M novels and novellas, and Dessert did not disappoint! A fast, fun read with some jaw dropping sticky sex on the table that involves bananas and ice cream. The story centers around the present situation with Sean trying to get his lover back, attempting to make up for past mistakes. But there&iexcl;s enough of the past and their individual current lives sprinkled in to add a little depth to the story. If you&iexcl;re looking for a quick read that ends with a cold shower, this is the book for you!

"My first impression when I opened the box that contained this bag was: WOW, GODZILLA.

First, I really didn't care for the metal framing. I thought it made the bag bulky, and unconfortable.  Sure it makes the bag sturdier, but I'm not planning to use my camera backpack as a weapon in a battery assault.  Second, it is not really as spacious as you might think.  The camera compartment is really hard to access since the flap won't stay open on its own when the bag is laid on the ground.  You'll have to hold the flap open, while getting your camera or lense.  Third, the opening for the camera (the way it is designed to open) just makes me cringe.  Even though there is another zipped cover net behind that front flap, I just don't like the fact that anyone walking behind you at the airport can freely open that part of the bag and steal my camera so easily.  In my opinion, the design looks very very cool, it's just very very illogical.

"I purchased this for around $130 as a back up. I figure, I am spending this much money, it oughtta be a pretty decent unit. Well, while it stores information, the transfer rate is HORRIBLE, even when plugged into a USB 2.0 certified port. While trying to access this HDD through my computer, it takes anywhere from 5-15 seconds for all the information to register on the HDD. In other words, when you click to access the HDD, none or only part of what is stored on the HDD is available until it loads fully, which can take as much as 15 seconds. The thing is, is that there is still about 1.25TB left, so transfer rates should NOT be this slow. I expected this to respond much faster. I would say that to transfer 60GB it takes about an hour. I can transfer files between my 700GB Caviar Black and 640GB Caviar Blue WAAAAAAY faster than from my Black to this. And the Caviar Black is a pretty speedy little HDD. Is this something that should be expected from large storage units?

Bottom line, if you have the ability to spend a little more for a better unit, I suggest doing so. Perhaps I got one that isn't functioning to its full potential. Perhaps I don't know how to use a PnP device... Hahaha. Right. At least it stores the information.

"The original book may do a better job, but this HBO production takes great license with the facts, to strumpet things up for a public who seem to need the violent and naked, or otherwise they turn the channel to something equally brain-dead.  Factually, there is nobody who can document so much of what's presented here as ""fact"" -- such as Hamilton and the Adam's cousin, screaming for blood, with twisted angry faces, as a Tory tax agent is tarred and feathered. One almost expects Walter Cronkite to step out from the crowd with a microphone, as in the old ""You Are There"" series.  It also appears to be a conscious effort to show the early American revolutionaries were no different from modern anti-global thugs throwing bricks through MacDonald's and Starbuck's windows, and carrying effigies of modern political leaders hanging from ropes while waving the Red Fascist flags.  The legitimacy of early American sentiments for freedom and self-government is thereby eroded and belittled, while modern fanatics are elevated inappropriately.  Or the ""small"" fact that two of the British soldiers at the Boston massacre actually were convicted, and one of them admitted to his lawyer that he was the one who shouted ""Fire"" (while discharging his weapon), and not one of the street mob. The erasure and clever distortion of those kinds of facts is exactly how a trained propagandists works, not to make big obvious lies, but to cleverly skew things in a particular direction, and also to highlight the rare event (ie, the tarring-and-feathering) to make it seem equal to common events (heavy-handed British thuggery against the population of the Americas) which are down-played, or not even mentioned!  With those kinds of factual distortions, how can any of it be trusted?  It cannot!

"Let me be blunt--Kowalski and Queenie were the only reason this movie gets four stars. Had it not been for their appeal as individuals and their chemistry as a couple...ish duo, I'd be giving this a three, instead. Sure, Eddie Redmayne was engaging, and Katherine Waterston was satisfactory. But the real magic--pardon the pun--rested with the performances by Alison Sudol and Dan Fogler. These two absolutely made the movie. Fogler was endearing and funny. Sudol was nuanced and magnetic. The final scene between these two--no spoilers--was my favorite part of this whole film.

And therein, I think, lies something of a problem.

Because this was supposed to be a movie about Newt. Newt and his beasts. Newt, and his beasts, and his friends. All of them fighting some dark force, as it so often goes in the wizarding world. And while this movie undoubtedly contained every one of those elements...I didn't care, At least, not as much as I expected to care with a film set in the Harry Potter Universe. Newt felt like an afterthought forced into a starring role. His animals played a very limited role in the climax of the story, despite being the stars of the title. And whole plotline surrounding the darkness they found themselves up against struck me as needlessly convoluted. In the end, I viewed this as less of a harrowing adventure film detailing the rise of Newt Scamander than a platform for enjoying the chemistry between a muggle named Kowalski and a witch named Queenie.

All in all, this film felt a little forced, largely unfocused, and--had it not been for the supporting cast--maybe unforgettable. But luckily, it has Kowalski and Queenie. So if you've got the money to spare, give it a shot for them. Or just Redbox it.",4.0,0

"This works very well at grinding coffee grounds, and I would bet it would do just as well I grind and other things are listed in the instructions (peppercorns, seeds, and similar spices other than fresh herbs). It is very simple and straightforward to use. A few of the features that I especially appreciate our:

 - The fact that once you put in the settings (which are very simple), it automatically grinds for as long as needed and then automatically stops. The grinder I replaced did not do this, so it always left me wondering how long I should grind to make sure everything is round up while not grinding it to finally, and I often had to just open it up and put my finger around the grounds to check.

 - The locking mechanisms are very secure and I have confidence that it won't accidentally open, spilling the contents

 - That the part holding the blade and the coffee grounds is easily removable, Which will allow me to clean it easily with soap and water.

The only thing I've noticed that I wish was different was the cup number settings. The lowest setting is 4 cups, followed by 8, 10, 12. I wish there was a 6 cup setting, as I normally make 6 cups when I have company.

I saw a couple of comments about the cord and I have mixed feelings about it. On one hand, arranging for the cord to simply wrap around the outside of the bottom of the unit would be simpler  that's what my old one did. That you actually pull down on the bottom to reveal the cord storage was not intuitive  I need to read the directions  but now that I understand how to access it, it seems like a nice way to keep the look streamlined.

"This is a must have for anyone who wants to try out a new bat for the first time.

I had a friend who was going to have a bat in a local store that had a similar bat and we were using it for batting practice. This bat was great and we loved it. It was a bit expensive but it was worth it and it fit our needs.

We just went to Walmart and bought a new bat. It was $30 cheaper than the old bat and we were thrilled with the price.

"At first I thought I was getting a great deal, buying this dual switch for half the price of a Leviton one. But when I received it and checked out the rocker movement, I quickly concluded I got ripped off. The movement of the two switches is so flimsy and floppy, I can't image this thing will last anywhere close to my dead Leviton, which we had for nearly ten years before one of the rockers got jammed. While the rockers on this Baomain switch have some play in the ON direction and eventually require some effort to turn the switches on, in the OFF direction it takes very little effort to turn it off. When ON, only a slight tap causes the switch to turn OFF. I didn't bother wasting my time installing it, and instead went to my local hardware store and got a Leviton switch. Bummer, because I was very excited to save half off of my future switch purchases. Oh well; buyer be warned.",1.0,0

"This shower head is fantastic.  My other shower head was very noisy, and the water flow / coverage was not that great.  The main problem was that you had to reach / feel into the shower to see if the water was warm enough to get into the shower plus it took 1 minute minimum to warm up to a comfortable temperature.  This new head allows us to visually see when the water is cold, warm, and hot, it allows us to set a temp that we like visually (color of blue, green, red depict 3 temp ranges), has versatile spray selections although we basically use just the rain shower setting.  Also, a giant plus is how fast the shower warms up to temperature now - I'm guessing this benefit is because of better water flow allows the hot water to reach the head faster.

That  and no more, and it is everything."" This is the most deeply *visual* prose I've read since...well, since Conrad.

With this in mind, one line from the book struck me: ""How many of us can say we've made a new world out of the things that terrify and move us?"" Well,Elizabeth Hand can, anyway.

"This 2015 version of Mattel's My Password Journal has some significant improvements over&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/the-old-version/dp/B00IVFCCMA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">the old version</a>.

For starters, and probably most importantly for people who had the old one, there is a major improvement in the voice recognition.  Where before the password had to be said with EXACTLY the same tone (and background noise), the new version does a better (not perfect, but better) job of filtering background noise and is significantly more forgiving of the tone.  Fore example, when my 7yo tried to open her old Password Journal, if it didn't open the first time or two she would get frustrated and that frustrated tone would ensure it would not open at all.  This journal is more forgiving in the first place, and even if she gets frustrated it still responds about half of the time.

Now let's be real, this isn't a real diary-type journal.  It's definitely a gimmicky toy, so if your little one is looking for something more secure, an&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/old-fashioned-locking-diary/dp/B00NYAGMQ4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">old-fashioned locking diary</a>&nbsp;may be a better bet.  For the gadget girl who likes to fiddle with tech this is a fun toy, complete with invisible(-ish) ink, a ""hidden"" (in the most obvious way) compartment, and the namesake verbal password.  The journal book itself is small, but my 7yo took it out and keeps random notes to and from friends in there instead.  When she pressed her friends to try to get into the journal, it says ""intruder alert!"" and they all giggled wildly, scheming of ways to keep secret notes from their nemesis: little brother.

Of course there's a password bypass on the back, which means it's never really secure.  Which is fine, a 7yo doesn't need to be keeping secrets from her parents anyway.  ;-).",4.0,0

"I enjoy this series for the facts that it is science fiction and erotic and a little kick ass. I love the characters for not being boring but having some larger than life personalities with just the right amount of neurosis to make them very human and likeable. The worlds that they inhabit are just as varied as the people that live on them. This is the story of Steffania Rickard and Ramsey DeKieran's, the Captain of the Blue Daggers and a disgraced Lord who was found guilty of murder.

Captain Rickard is sent to bring Ramsey to meet with Ari and Doral to discuss a mission they wish him to under take that could mean a full pardon for him, if he returns. Ramsey has been a part of her fantasies since they fought side by side in the Haarb wars, but she would never give into them. Ramsey finds the Captain attractive but knows a woman like her could never give in to the types of hungers he has. Both are very wrong.

The pair are sent to bring back a Verdantian who is very important to the survival of the planet, Lady Alessa DeAlbero has been sold to Veacon Narr, a man who takes pleasure in bringing women to their knees. Everyone else who has attempted a rescue has not returned and he is considered to be expendable even if Steffania isn't. But together they find a way to do the impossible.

Though the story revolves around their rescue effort it is really about two people who have had the worst happen to them but are finding someone to complete them. Highly recommend.",5.0,0

"This spray was used in conjunction with other flea and tick prevention strategies. I used it to spray bedding that the problem cat would sleep and lay on a lot. In conjunction with this and flea/tick shampoos we were able to get rid of the fleas. I was careful to use very very little of the spray as I am sure my cat was having a reaction to normal amounts. So while this product worked, I did not feel comfortable with using a lot. My cat began to drool a bit and that is a symptom of flea prevention stuff irritating them.

The spray bottle is around 6 inches tall and 1.5 inches in diameter.

Pros:
*Helped supplement flea and tick prevention strategy

Cons:
*Can cause a reaction in cats if used a normal amount(-1 star)

Additional Considerations:
Consider other natural means of flea and tick prevention. Whatever you use, you will have to use multiple things in order to get rid of your flea problem.

Overall: 4/5 stars (>=.5 rounds up, <.5 rounds down) => 4 stars

I have a large rabbit cage which is 17x40 and my piggies sleep in this at night and spend all day in a kiddie play pool with a fence around it...3 ft round. I was using carefresh bedding and  a litter box which my boars use about half the time for pee and some poo. The carefresh is odor absorbing but definitely dusty....then along comes whelping pads. WOW!!! I BOUGHT A 36 inch pad and put that in the bottom of the kiddie pool. Its soft and wonderful for piggie feet and I only need to take a little plastic sand shocel and scoop up any poops and place in the litter box. Pee is immediately absorbed and after a week still no smell.
I washed the pad in the washing machine on cold and dried on low heat, cones out like new. So I then got the slightly thicker paw print pads as poctured and one pad fits in the travel cage I have and 2 pads fit in their night home cage.
I just use my toy shovel each morning and its great. I was able to get carefresh bedding on sale so I use that only in the litter box.
Persobally these make the cages look neat and fresh and I think its better to not have as much paper bedding. Its cheaper than fleece and I think more absorbing.

This unit is actually working better than the one we had before it. The dimensions are just right. The blades are nice and thick and the blades are not so thin as some of the blades we have been using. The blades are very thin and don't seem to have the strength to hold up with a heavy weight. The blades do not have a strong enough grip to make a great counterweight. I am not sure if this is a good design or if it is just a matter of how the blades are spaced. We have been using the blade for a while now and it is still holding up well. We have not had any problems with the blades sticking to the counter and we have not had any issues with the blades sticking to the counter.,4.0,1
"I bought this for my 5 year old, and he LOVES it. Let's start with the good:

1. The pictures on the dice are fun and great for a Mario fan.
2. This is a great game to help younger kids who are learning to add and write numbers. It is also good in that it helps teach strategy.
3. Adults can have fun playing as well since we remember this game from when we were young.
4. Everything fits nicely in the question mark box when you are done playing.

The not so good:

1. I had to coat the dice with clear nail polish as a preventative measure to keep the graphics from wearing off (thank you to the reviewer who suggested that)
2. The score cards are really small and for a little kid trying to write numbers, it can be hard to fit the writing into the space allotted. But I have to say that I don't think the score cards are all that much smaller than the yahtzee we used to play. And, as someone else pointed out, the pages are easily scanned and enlarged. The only problem there is that larger papers would not fit so neatly in the box.
3. There is a glaring typo on the scorecard. Not a big deal for adults, but confusing for a five year old.

Overall, for the price, you will get hours of enjoyment from this game. And even if it is not the most durable or well made game, for under 20 dollars, I think it is fine. Especially if you have a Mario fan!",4.0,0

"This doesn't really fit the bill. The only way to fix it is to just throw the one in a bag.  The plastic part needs to be re-attached to the lens cap to make it fit.  The camera will only use one lens at a time.

I haven't used it with a Nikkor, but I do like it a lot.  I wish I could buy a lens cap for it, but I don't think I'll have to do that.

The other issue I have with it is that it doesn't fit the lens hood.  The hood is a good thing, because it's kind of stiff.  I wish I had found one that was a bit bigger.

Overall, this camera is a good value and I'd recommend it to anyone.  I'd probably buy another if I could.

"I was given a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.

I really wanted to like this book. I thought it was a great premise and that the author was very creative in her world building. This is a book about triplets who are separated from each other at birth. On their 15th birthday their father brings them together and shares that they have a destiny together to save the world from evil.
Rise of the Trinity started out really well and had a great part in the middle, but overall it left me disappointed. There were several grammatical errors and typos. The wrong names in the wrong place, of instead of or, and similar mistakes. I found the timeline to be very confusing. When the book starts the characters are all teenagers. Midway through the book they have their 15th birthday. At times the reader is told in the narrative that years have passed, but the action would not indicate this. It might be helpful to mark the changing of time for the readers so that they are not trying to put the pieces together.

"Purchased this stroller September 2013 to help my beagle with a ligament issue in his back leg take a break on walks. At first I was happy with the quality of the stroller including the wheels (actual tires with inner tubes) and the ability to easily lock the stroller in place. It also gave us the freedom to go on longer walks. However as reported by another reviewer, despite the stroller saying ""up to 70 pounds"" this was completely inaccurate. As such, my dog would take up the entire stroller which put strain on some of the mesh panels which then began to unravel. Since the stroller did give us the freedom to move about I kept it and made repairs every time a section came undone though over time the separation in the fabric occurred all over the stroller and not just where he would lean. The stroller had major patchwork from all my repairs but I was going for function over looks. However, with continued use the frame became a quite wonky though still usable but the final nail in the coffin occurred today when one of the back tires broke off while we were using it. I'm going to research how much a spare tire would cost but frankly, after 2 1/2 years of intermittent use I expected it to last a  bit longer considering the price I paid at the time, $216 plus tax. If you have a small dog-less than 25 lbs, this stroller may work for you but if we decide to get another stroller I don't think I will go with this brand.",3.0,0

"Funny, but I don't recall the other book leaving out this much information, but then again it was this time last year that I was reading it so maybe my memory's not so fresh.

""2 weeks later"" ""6 months later"" these are only 3 word phrases, it wouldn't take much to add them. But one minute it was Christmas, then after a separator in the middle of the page - which usually indicates a scene change - it's spring break, then next thing you know it's Thanksgiving. One of the reasons this is a problem is right before the page separator, Adam and JJ were saying they needed to discuss something important, and then after the separator, not only has it been discussed, but the process has been put in motion and they're almost completely done with it. No build-up or anything. This happened several times, which left me scratching my head and wondering ""well, what happened in between?"" I was glad that they were able to help provide a safe place for Thad, but what happened when they went to talk to his parents? Was there no argument or backlash at all? No obstacles in their way? And how did they decide to get legal guardianship? And why was the situation with Andrea helping out Adam and JJ handled like it was no big deal, just every day happenstance? And what happened with Grace Griffin? And this may be minor, but how on Earth did Thad get a new love interest before Adam's brother, Matt? Too many questions.

"Luther Davis wrote and produced this dark, doom-laden 1964 movie.  For me it works on two levels.  In many ways it resembles a Hitchcock suspense movie.  Will the wealthy widow, trapped in a stalled elevator in her home during a long weekend, survive the confinement and the violence and threats she receives from drunks, thugs and hoodlums that invade her home. Watch Olivia de Havilland's face in the final fade out, however, and you'll realize that these events represent a woman being forced to re-evaluate her life.

Previously the focus of her life had been the adored, pampered, 30 year old son who lived with her.  During her caged ordeal she learns that her son wants to leave home, taking half the contents of the safe.  If his wishes are not met, he will shoot himself.

Hitherto, the woman had been living in a kind of enclosed world, unchanging, suspended between two levels of reality.  Now, however, miraculously freed from it, is the world outside the ""cage"" a better one?  Her home is trashed, she has been beaten up by a thug, and her son is threatening suicide.

"Well--appears Fiona Gavelle is up to her legal antics again.  And her writer, Una Tiers, is up to her tricks again, delivering yet another page-turner with ""Not Safe for the Bank(er)"".

Ms Tiers calls it a short story.  I would bicker with that classification and call it, rather, a novella, or, a short novel.  It provides all the satisfaction one receives from a work that is longer than a short story, in that allows for a fuller development of character, and a plot that can be more convoluted with considerably more back story.

Fiona Gavelle was introduced in ""Judge vs. Nuts"" as a newbie attorney solving a murder mystery while stumbling and tripping her way through a legal system that doesn't favor the still innocent and idealistic attorney in her dealings with the ""good ol' boys"" of the bar.

In this book, we get the feeling that Fiona, thank goodness, still hasn't lost her innocence and idealism while doing the leg work for her client-by-default, Mr. Fives.  (You'll have to read it to find out just how he fell in her lap--but it's an enjoyable challenge).

Between the first book and this one there is a perceptible growth and maturity in the character of Fiona Gavelle.  But it is refreshing to rediscover that the revolving door still can slap her in the butt.

You're gonna love ""Not Safe for the Bank(er)""!",5.0,0

"The Lego Connoisseur Here, Reviewing the Snowspeeder.

True to my beliefs, we picked this up for $25.00 at Legoland.  Less than $0.10 a brick!

Believe it or not, we bought this for a three year old, hey it was Legoland and we were in the moment!  Probably should of known better all things considered...This Lego set feels very strong when built--durable even, through many battle simulations it has survived harsh environments and many gun shots!  Until his other brother shot it down with a fanfare of no other.  Not recommended for little kids since most battles end with a request for a rebuild, much to parents dismay.  However the largest one (ahem...) loves this Lego Star Wars Set.

First, it is a relatively older set.  I remember it when I was boy.  My friend had it (and all the other ones too).  Tons of fun, decent instructions to go along with it, but not quite as user friendly as the newer more, ""step by step"" instruction designs.  This felt more true to the old movie than many other sets without as many custom parts as those tend to have.  Plus Luke, with a light-saber is always awesome.

The few complaints I have is related to the cockpit...There really isn't enough room.  I wish they had built it up a little more so that the fighters could sit up straight.  I also which that Luke had some spot to put his light-saber in the cockpit.  I think the spring-shooting darts are a bit too sensitive, they went off several times without much input from me.  And finally, the little shooter by the grappling hook can easily fall out and it isn't exactly the easiest piece to put back on.",5.0,0

"Way before she grabbed an Oscar nomination for her searing performance as a world-weary prostitute in Leaving Las Vegas, Elisabeth Shue was known as one of the squeaky-clean actresses of the '80s.

Having made a smash in ""The Karate Kid"" and the '60s-nostalgia TV series ""Call to Glory"", Shue cemented her good-girl reputation with the charming but badly titled Adventures in Babysitting.

Set in the John Hughes-style suburbs of Chicago, the titular adventures follow babysitter Chris (Elisabeth Shue), who agrees to watch the Anderson kids (Keith Coogan and Maia Brewton) when her boyfriend cancels their anniversary date.

All is quiet on the home front until Chris is called upon to rescue her best friend (Penelope Ann Miller, also doing good-girl duty) from the seedy downtown bus station. She can't leave the kids, and she can't leave her friend alone in the big bad city, so she packs everyone in the station wagon and heads into Chicago.

Screwball craziness begins as they encounter car thieves, knife-wielding gangs, gun-toting truck drivers, and, worst of all, Chris's duplicitous boyfriend. It's hardly mature entertainment, but Shue makes it work; when she wins over the audience at a blues club with her improv singing, you'll be won over, too.

In his directorial debut, Chris Columbus (who later went on to helm the sap-fests Mrs. Doubtfire and Home Alone) gently skewers the suburbia white-bread mindset of the main characters, and plays up the comedy over the schmaltz with a subtlety of which he now seems incapable; the near romance between Shue and Coogan is played lightly and adorably.

Look for brief appearances by art-house faves Lolita Davidovich as a college party girl and Vincent D'Onofrio as an unlikely savior.

This comedy flick also takes me back to memory lane to when I was 14 going on 15 years old in my Freshmen year in high school during its theatrical release in the Summer of 1987.",4.0,0

After hours of driving she pulls up to a house she thinks is her home and knocks on the door.  The door is opened by her shocked husband and finds out shes been gone for seven months and has no memory of where shes been or why.  The next day she tells her husband that she wants to retrace her route to see where shes been and why. Now things really get strange but interesting. Its a really good plot and worth reading.,4.0,0

"I tried 2 from each container (4 total)

MATCHES - 1 broke in half, one didn't lite after many attempts, 2 lit but only after many attempts. I my initial and admittedly informal testing, I had a 50% failure rate.

STRIKER BAR - Unfortunately I don't want to try lighting any more because it looks like either the sandpaper striker is either getting gummed up by the previous failed attempts <or> the abrasive has already started to wear off...after 4 matches the striker is now smooth.

CONTAINER - The cap doesn't screw on/off - it has no threads or o-ring. I did submerge the case in water for about a minute and I didn't see any water inside, but I'd be much more comfortable with a cap that screws on and seals with an o-ring, like other matches offered on Amazon.

BOTTOM LINE: I can't give it 1 star, because if you can get them lit, they're better than a regular match...however, these feel like a ""One Star"" product...it feels a bit like a Bait-N-Switch to me. It looks like the good matches, but these are flimsy, inconsistent and unreliable.",2.0,0
"Adding my voice to the negative reviews about the longevity of the cord and general construction weakness.  Do heed these warnings!  I was concerned the moment I opened the box.  I haven't seen this sort of cord design in a decade.  Most modern earbuds are designed with a rectangular device in mind, i.e. they employ an elbow shaped plug.  This one goes straight out of the unit meaning it'll constantly get bent whether you're using it with a laptop or much more so when it's plugged into an phone or music player that might be in your pocket.

And sure enough, after 9 months of careful usage, the cord failed.  (Also, long before that, the rubber sealant around the connection to the ear piece itself split on both sides not boding well for the future - tho that didn't turn out to actually cause any problems - just a premonition...)

"This very enjoyable story takes unusual directions from the start. Our heroine is a young woman of respectable background who has had her life ruined by a wealthy man. She has been banished to a convent. Meanwhile our hero is a man who went to America as a trader but took the losing side in the Civil War and has returned, with only a ship, to take up a family title. He learns that he will relinquish the lands if he does not marry and produce an heir by a certain date, which is only a few months away. This option appears to be impossible until as luck would have it, he meets our heroine who is in an interesting condition.

A somewhat creepy item is that the hero's ship carries the remains of his mother whom he wishes to bury on her family land. Why he could not do that without owning the land is unclear. The wish seemed tossed in to make the hero more altruistic and less land-grabbing. We are reminded of a certain character several times by the heroine pointedly asking what can have become of her or a message she carried. This builds to a suspense finale which again is most unusual in period romances.

Read, enjoy, be surprised. There is lots of fun historical detail such as how inheritance worked and this has to be explained to the hero for our benefit, he having been in America for twenty years.",5.0,0

"About as witless and not-horrifying as you can get while making a supposed horror film. We meet four wealthy and one not-wealthy Southern college ""students"" who rent a house together for what seems like endless summer, although they're supposedly going to class. After interminable conversations about their pointless lives and activities, you start rooting for some slaughter just to end it all. Many, many buildups to climaxes that don't arrive, and repeated scenes of the ""students"" going into an empty basement with no payoff. And just to get a bottle of wine from a box in the farthest room along. I thought at first, ""OK, it's really a potion, and they'll all see the ghosts and attack each other"" but it was just wine. Then I kept saying, ""Since you're drinking so much, just bring the whole box up!!!"" But that would have been too easy. These are also the most subdued ""college students"" I've ever seen in a movie.
Of course it's fun to mock bad movies, but sheesh, this one messes up everything: A Civil War setup goes nowhere; scenes are brightly lit when it's supposed to be dark; the same mysterious sounds lead to nothing; a haunted student-rented house looks neater than something in Architectural Digest; and conversations mean nothing to the plot. After a few minutes, it's all about characters you wish you could murder yourself...I watched in sheer incredulity until it was over. (Yes, fine, I'm a glutton for punishment.) At one point, the camera even shook--a lot-- when a character got into a car, and not because there was a demon in it. The photography was actually quite good, if too clear and bright, so it seems more advanced than a student film, but comes across as more of a travelogue for Hampton Roads, Va than something calculated to chill your li'l ol' heart.",1.0,0

"Habits we all have them, we all use them  but we all don't know why or how.

Yet our habits, many would say, rule us. They are powerful factors in what we do, in who we are,  They influence our buying habits. guide us through complex actions such as driving a car all without the hint of a thought on our part. And that's a blessing for we could not possibly think of every detail  of every task we have to do. Habits are our overdrive mechanism.

This book explores  the power of our habits and how we can change them in ourselves,  in the work place and in society.

A full forty percent of what we do every day is predicated on engrained habits. Our responses particularly to mundane activities are automatic, don't require any thinking and fall into routines, one triggering another. The process provides comfort and thus we keep repeating them.
Even if the habit reinforces bad behavior, its comfort zone reinforces our behavior.

The book is replete with examples of how clever people manipulated our habits or created new ones in us to have us support a particular sports team, buy Pepsodent or Febrez. All accomplished subconsciously on a hapless public. A thoughtful reading of this book could make you a more sophisticated consumer.

A chapter entitled ""The Golden Rule of Habit Change"" provides pragmatic advice not only on discovering your hidden habits but how to intervene to change them.  The author provides many examples of persons who did just that.  Their stories are downright inspiring.",5.0,0

"There are two things that might be of interest to some viewers. One is that director of ""Solstice"" is Daniel Myrick, who co-directed a hugely successful horror ""The Blair Witch Project"" in 1999 (with Eduardo Snchez). The other is his latest film stars Shawn Ashmore (""Iceman"" of the ""X-Men"" franchise) and Amanda Seyfried (a young bride-to-be in ""Mamma Mia!""). As a horror film, however, ""Solstice"" offers little more than familiar scares and ineffective narrative despite its stars, beautifully shot photography and some intriguing narrative elements.

""Solstice"" follows the story of Megan (Elisabeth Harnois) trying to recover from one shocking incident that happened to her family, and her friends Christian, Zoe, Mark and Alicia. They travel to a quiet lake house for their annual summer trip, where Megan starts experiencing strange things, like seeing things. Megan comes to believe that some supernatural presence is trying to contact her, perhaps her twin sister Sophie, to let Megan know some secrets. Or maybe she is mistaken.

I can't reveal it in detail, but in the second half of the film an interesting development takes place as Megan realizes the truth about the weird images she continues to see. But the film's slow-paced earlier part is boring with clichd devices such as moving shadows and a ""creepy"" old guy (R. Lee Ermey). In the end of the film everything is explained and some of the characters, including R. Lee Ermey's ""Leonard,"" show unexpected sides, but it takes too long (more than 50 minutes) before the film reaches that point.

According to the opening credit, ""Solstice"" is based on a 2003 Danish film ""Midsommer."" Perhaps something is lost in translation. Perhaps not. Whichever it is, I feel there is a better movie buried in here.",2.0,0

"Censorship and moral codes took the bite out of screwball comedy as the 1930s progressed, but in the 1940s such directors as Howard Hawks and Preston Sturges found ways to revive the genre in very high style.  Not only is THE LADY EVE one of Sturge's best, it is also one of the finest in the entire genre, a comedy so potent that even the most jaded will be completely charmed.
There is no way to describe the story without spoiling the fun, so suffice to say the plot concerns the heir to a fortune (Fonda)who is beset by a beautiful but predatory card shark (Stanwyck)--and who looses considerably more than his heart in the process. Considered racy for its time, Stanwyck's... manipulation of Fonda is one of the funniest elements of the film, and the movie as a whole abounds with ""Garden of Eden"" motifs: the name Eve, apples, and (of course) a snake.  Everything moves along at a fast pace and with plenty of crackle, so there's never a dull moment, and the exceptional supporting cast includes witty performances from Charles Coburn, Eugene Pallette, William Demarest, Eric Blore, and a host of others. It would be hard to imagine any one who wouldn't enjoy seeing this film at least once--and like the best films, THE LADY EVE does not give up all her secrets in one whack. The story and performances bear up under repeated viewings.  Comedy fans will enjoy it again and again!",5.0,0

"In 2006, Grigory Perelman proved that an academic with a PhD in history could make a difference in the lives of two people. The book, ""A History of the United States"", is a great book. It covers the history of the United States from the American Revolution to the present day. In the book, Perelman provides us with a list of the major events that shaped the nation. He discusses the role of the American Revolution and the role of the white slave trade in the growth of the country. He also discusses the history of the American Revolution and the role of the slave trade in the development of American capitalism.

It presents stories of dark things lurking in completely unobtrusive places.

The Deep End (Robert McCammon)
Very straightforward and uncomplicated. My only criticism would be the unnecessary 'epilogue'. I guess this one is my favorite. 4 stars.

Interval (Norman Prentiss)
The first part really gave me the creeps because of its realistic subject. Unfortunately, the author added some supernatural element which didn't work out for me, but add confusion to an otherwise great story. 3 stars

If These Walls Could Talk (Shawntelle Madison)
Nice one with an unexpected twist that caught me by surprise and made me shudder. I loved the detail with the fox eye. 4 stars

Great reference to the author C.S. Lewis, though I would have preferred something more fantastic in the line of his work. The ending was not as climactic as expected and Jerry's sacrifice seemed unnecessary. 4 stars

"I put this on a large 6 month old kitten, who is already quite muscular, but with all the litheness of a kitty with especially slick, longish hair. I successfully put smaller versions on two smaller kittens, who did not have the strength to object quite so vigorously. This is another drawback of this rig. If the cat gets in in his head that he does not want this gizmo put on him, it becomes very difficult to attach it. Two grown men, both with good histories with wrangling cats, tried to put this rig on my 6 month old male, and it was quite a chore. There are two clips which fasten beneath the cat's tummy, which are so small, it becomes very difficult for a normal adult to open them. It is also difficult to connect the two halves, when they are laying against a cat with moderately long fur, which insists on getting in the way. These noisome connections are at the most inconvenient location, when a single person has to hold down an uncooperative kitty, and connect them at the same time. You need four hands at least.

So, that is two strikes against this design for large, energetic cats. After two grown men believed they had successfully harnessed our feline Houdini, he wriggled out of it in about 2 minutes. One second it was on, and the next, it was off. It was that fast. Makes me want to go into business to design a better kitty harness.",3.0,0

"Another thoroughly captivating, kept-me-up-reading-all-night story by Josh Lanyon. The story being told in Griff's POV really worked for me, I really connected with him, and reveled in experiencing everything through his eyes, and having access to his impressions of everyone he met. Griff and Pierce made for deliciously intriguing main characters, both having their demons and past hurts to deal with, a past Pierce was so reluctant for Griff to open again..but which he eventually benefited from. The author once again gifts readers with a substantive and poignant portrayal of the human heart.

I loved the distinctiveness of all the secondary characters, each of whom had a crystal clear portrayal.  The Long Island setting and mystique was a character in its own right - I love when an author portrays setting so vividly that I feel as if I am a participant within the story and not simply reading it. The mystery held so many possibilities, just when I thought I was sure of one facet, I found myself doubting... excellent maneuvering of plot, with a great twist at the end. I'll be reading this one again - even though I now know the outcome of the mystery... the lovely nuanced writing style of Mr. Lanyon freely lends itself to new discoveries upon re-reading.",5.0,0

I have had my Escort for a few weeks. I upgraded from a whistler. Right away I noticed a decrease in false alarms. This to me was amazing as the whistler liked to go off at every turn. The alarm sounds of the Escort are much less nerve racking and sounds loudly at first but will then cut the volume down. Another cool thing is the smart cord. This cord has a led only when it is plugged into the radar detector and has another led for when it is detecting radar. Again not in an annoying way. The escort has a dark mode which almost shuts all the led lights off so as not to distract you at night but the audibles will sounds and the smart cord led will light up but since it is down by the cigarette lighter and not in your face it does not distract you from the road. Overall I give this 5 stars hands down compared to the radar detectors I have had in the past.,5.0,0
"I am so angry. Frontline DOES NOT WORK. Idk where all these people live that frontline actually works, but they must not have many ticks. We live in upstate New York, where there are lots of ticks.

"Once again the dumb people on Amazon reviewing products amazes me. Blaming a rowdy dog for destroying the cot, saying it is not sturdy etc is just some of the nonsense I have read about this cot. I got my original one over a year ago from Costco and placed it on our back deck. Now let me tell you, I live in the mountains where it's a hard life for anything outdoors, constant rain, heavy snow loads and cold temperatures really take a beating on thIngs up here. I also have 7 rescue dogs that share this cot of varying sizes from a 13 pound min pin mix to a 65 lb rottie mix. I rescued my min pin mix from the streets at 6 months old and one she felt at home she decided it was her mission to eat as much stuff as possible. She loves to nest on this bed by scratching all around and digging into it so naturally the use of the dogs, her scratching at it and the weather (including very heavy snow loads on it) got to it and it got some fairly large holes in the mesh. Do I blame the bed? No way! Duh! It's being used so I don't see how people can blame a product for wearing from being used but somehow they do it seems. So not a big deal to by a less then 20 buck replacement cover and put it on, but maybe that's because I am not ridiculous.

"I, too, have been a DeWalt user for many years, having moved to their brand when I felt the Makita line went substandard.  After deciding to move up to an 18 volt product, I spent months conducting research, going to wood shows, and actually trying out numerous lithium ion and non-litium ion 18 volt tools.  My final choice was this kit.  Here are some of the reasons why:

Batteries:  18 volt lithium ion.  Fantastic idea to go with lithium ion.  The charge lasts longer and will not dissipate over time.  In addition, the battery design (outer housing) is smart.  I do not need to click two buttons on the side to disengage the battery from any of the tools.  I simply need to click the one button on the front of the battery and the battery slides out.  Because my hands are small, this makes all the difference in the world.

Drill Driver - For my hands, this was the most ergonomically correct grip I found.  This drill feels great, does not fatigue my hands after many hours of use, and does not weigh as much as the competition.  The 18 volt battery does not add as much weight as I thought it would, and the tool balances in my hand perfectly.  In addition, I didn't think I would like having LED's built into the drill, but I really do like the additional light when I am working.  Excellent drill all around.

Recip Saw - Again, excellent feel and power.  I have used this saw to cut through a variety of materials without any lag.  The one button saw change also adds a nice touch.  Grip and balance are excellent, with the battery adding the perfect amount of counterweight to the entire setup.

As I mentioned earlier, I looked at all of the kits available.  For the price and the product you receive, I don't think you could find a better value for your money than this kit.",5.0,0

"Jules Feiffer is characteristically hilarious in all of his books (like the Man in the Ceiling, for instance), however, this book is more than just hilarity. It is deceptively simple; simple in style, and simple in writing, but Feiffer teaches countless lessons in this book. However, instead of being preachy, he disguises them behind his singular style of ""funniness"". I could cite a hundred of these lessons. For instance, the ""Valley of Vengeance""; the villagers who thought of nothing but ""getting even"" with their neighbours, burning down their house and snatching their stuff. They lived in a veritable paradise but they never looked beyond harming their fellow man, and when Roger showed up as an eagle and introduced laughter and beauty, their lives changed, and they thought less about vengeance and more about harmony.
Also, it has its funny points (which are many), but it is also despairingly tragic at times. I read this book first when I was 8, and it was just a funny book, but having read it again at an older age (16), I understand even more than I saw before. So, if you get a chance, this book is a must.

"I have used this scope on two heavy recoiling .44 magnums, a Smith & Wesson Stealth Hunter and a Ruger Bisley Hunter.  Unfortunately the Magnaports on the S&W blasted the front underside of the front bell, but that's not the fault of the scope.  It just blasted the finish some, the scope still works fine.

That said, at least for me the 4-6x range on this scope is not that useful on a handgun.  I seldom shoot beyond 100 yards with handguns and the increased magnification is distracting unless I am shooting off sand bags.  I mostly use this set to 2X, and since I don't need the higher magnification I should have bought a fixed 2x.  That's *not* a criticism of this scope though, it works great at those magnifications, they are just more than I need.

EDIT: Well, it failed.  Something apparently came loose inside.  With it on 2X magnification it is now at least 4X, and the eye relief has shortened to the point where I have to hold it about 12"" from my eye now to see the full view.  It has suffered through probably 5-600 rounds of full power .44 magnum, but it apparently cannot stand that pounding.  I have lowered my rating to a 2, pending Bushnell's response on their ""Lifetime Warranty"".

EDIT2: Bushnell sat on it for a month, then returned it saying it met specs.  It's seriously broken, it does NOT meet their published specs at all.  Eye relief has shortened to about 12"" and it is way over-magnifying.  I will never, ever buy another Bushnell product.  I'd give it zero stars, but 1 is the lowest number you can choose here.",1.0,0

"Here's a wonderful book for any fan of Ursula Le Guin. It begins with a foreword by the author in which she outlines each of the stories, most of which take place on worlds of her well-known Ekumen, her &#147;Hainish Universe.&#148;. However alien the cultures may be, however strange their societal structures and customs, Ms. Le Guin uses each tale to underscore what truly unites us and makes us human. These stories comprise the first two-thirds of the book.
As much as I relish Le Guin&#146;s Hainish stories, it is the novelette &#147;Paradises Lost,&#148; comprising the final third of the book, that is most rewarding. It&#146;s a change of pace for the author, involving not the worlds of the Ekumen, but rather a generation spacecraft on a 201-year voyage from Earth to a &#147;New Earth&#148; orbiting some unnamed neighboring star. Most of the narrative involves characters who have lived their entire lives in this self-contained bubble of metal and air. They know nothing of Earth save what they have experienced via films and &#147;virtual reality&#148; programs. The simple concept of &#147;sky&#148; is completely unfathomable to them. They have their own rituals and customs with which they structure their lives until it becomes necessary to debark on the surface of a new world. Ultimately, for some hese colonists who have become comfortable in their self-contained universe, the notions of OUTSIDE and NEW WORLD begin to seem rather intimidating and even evil. How will they cope when the spacecraft arrives at its destination? Ms. Le Guin deftly explores this culture and its destiny, and the ending quite literally brought tears to my eyes. Throughout &#147;The Birthday of the World,&#148; we realize how much we have in common as human beings, no matter whether we are on Gethen, in a spaceship, on Earth, or anywhere in the universe, that we have our loves, our hopes, and our fears, and that EVERY DAY is the birthday of the world.",5.0,0

"I purchased a set of the Hamton Stovetop spoon stand for dinning room. The stand is designed well. The stand and dishes are good weight and very stable. Spoons rest on the dish and stand very balanced. The dishes have good depth and good size to hold the drippings. Dishes are also good quality and wash well in the dishwasher. I use these with my white/light colored serving and plates. Like it so much that I ordered another set for the kitchen counter.

I also own stainless spoon dish/stand set for over 10 years without any rust. That's one thing I can not yet rate because I haven't owned these long enough to know if they will rust or not.

"The story begins at a skating rink where a young girl pulls a gun on another teen and a standoff involving the police ensues. It sets off a chain of events that goes into a direction I didn't expect.

It's an awful, uncomfortable story that Slaughter tells masterfully. My emotions were all over the place, especially where Lena is concerned. By the end, I couldn't believe my feelings of sympathy for her, an amazing feat. Her soliloquy near the end was extraordinary. There were a number of themes resonating strongly, most loudly was the fragility of children's faith in the adults entrusted with their care.

The narration was a bit uneven, at times wonderful and at others, it felt like she was just reading.

While the subject matter is tough, its honest and realistic presentment was compelling. I'm pulling for Lena but I know she's going to disappoint me 100 times throughout this series. And that's impressive storytelling.",5.0,0

"It was hard to tell from the picture or the description whether the bowls were plastic or metal, and I unfortunately assumed the latter, but was wrong.  Plastic bowls are not great for most breeds of dogs, as they harbor bacteria, and obviously can be chewed, which can cause irritation and/or cuts and scrapes to the dogs face and mouth.  Also, to keep my dogs from stealing each others' food, I feed them in their crates.  From the dimensions I also assumed (I'll learn to stop assuming) that this feeder would fit comfortably in a large crate with plenty of room for my dog to eat.  Because the design of this feeder is so round and wide, the ""legs"" are just slightly too wide for the tray in the bottom of the crate.  This would probably be a decent feeder for someone who doesn't mind lots of plastic or that have a larger area for the feeder.  It's definitely not compact or discreet, though it does seem to be sturdy for an all plastic product.",4.0,0

"It ""ok"" but it depends om what items your putting into it, plus ""if"" it was put together correctly from the company. Overview:
I bought this Condor pocket pouch in tan and the NC Utility pouch by VISM in tan (see my review on that product page). The Condor pouch ""does have"" a lot of holding options inside of it, the only issue is that if the items you are trying to put into the pouch are too wide. (as in ""height"" ) the skinny pouch will not close. One issue:
The reason why only 3 stars, is while I ""really do"" love Condor products, this pouch on one side, has very ""weak"" stitching and you can see where it will fail after use. Really unhappy when I got my pouch and saw that. I have this molle'd to the other NCStar pouch to hold very light items, it ""may"" be ok in the long haul or maybe not with the weak stitching. I also put some ""krazy glue"" where the weak stitching is to try and stop it from getting worse. Other Thoughts:
One thing I tell people, is when you get a new bag or pouch like this. don't ""overstuff it"", but ""do try"" to fill it out. These pouches and bags are made very quickly, and quality control \ assurance slips thru as fast as loose stitching. When you fill up a pouch like this, you can tell pretty quickly if it is a good one or not. Conclusion:
So if I did get a good pouch without the weak stitching, I would still use this pouch for thin items like pens, paper and pocket knives and other ""low profile"" items that would fit. It would be nice if Condor customer service responded to my post. but I doubt that.",3.0,0

"I've switched many of the bulbs in my home to LEDs but unfortunately there are still some fixtures to which there is no LED equivalent bulb for, such as the 100W incandescent ones. I chose Philips bulbs because they generally produce high quality bulbs and such is the case with this CFL, unfortunately one of the downsides of CFLs is that they take time to warm up. This bulb turns on and looks to be about 60% of maximum brightness for about a minute. The gradual increase in brightness is slow enough you don't actually notice it, but once the bulb is warm you can turn it off and back on and it goes back to 100% brightness. The color representation is good and it is slightly brighter than the equivalent 100W incandescent bulb while only using about 1/4 of the energy. Since the cost is about 1/8th of a 60W equivalent bulb it's a good value proposition. 3/5 stars because it's not perfect and form factor is slightly larger than a traditional bulb so it doesn't fit in fixtures that use lamp shade harps. If Philips could make the size slightly smaller and make the warm up time better I'd give it another star.",3.0,0

"Why do I love this show?

I want every character on this show to be my best friend (except Robin).  They're funny, caring, and awesome.  The actors truly have tons of chemistry, providing a quality show in a half-hour block.

This is no generic sitcom.  Sure, it's got a laugh track and some of the banter is clich&eacute;, however, most of it is incredibly witty and heartfelt.  Ted is engaged in a genuine search for love, and I'm completely wrapped up in it.  I fell in love with the Cake Girl (Victoria, played by Ashley Williams) and was sad to see her go (it's probably why I'm not a huge fan of Robin).  This show has continuity and a compelling storyline; it simply amazes me.

It's very quotable.  I find myself quoting with friends I've talked into watching it (who get equally hooked).  The cast is brilliant, as well as the director and writers.  Bloc Party's song: `This Modern Love' at the close of Season One clenched it for me though, dramatically building up a powerful finale I won't soon forget.  It joins the hall of fame for greatest season finale songs with the likes of The O.C's: Imogen Heap `Hide and Seek' and Grey's Anatomy's: Snow Patrol `Chasing Cars'.

Hands down, this is the best sitcom I've ever seen.  Buy it, watch it, love it.

"Very happy with this Bellrock Growers Pet Greens, initially... I followed the instructions except I used a planter and did 2 containers instead of the bag and I added some organic potting soil of my own, underneath the provided soil and seeds.

After a few days in the shade, they were sprouting. After 5 days, it was growing to a nice length but a bit sparse. After 7 days, it was full and plentiful. I trimmed it daily, it was growing so fast. A month later, I started seeing some browning and then a bit of mold in the dirt. I don't think I've over-watered as I've been careful hoping to prevent that.

One of our two kittens eats his grass daily, like a little lawn mower every morning, smile. The other occasionally bites some off and plays with it. I put some clippings in their nightly dinner. No issues with vomiting and they both eat it just fine.

At about a dollar an ounce, I considered it a good value. I'm not sure if I'd buy a bag every month though. After some research, I'm going to dump what I have, wash the containers and give it another go. Next round, I'm going to try a spray bottle for watering instead, to provide a lighter watering and hopefully prevent mold.

I read that overwatering cat grass turns the soil acidic and encourages root rot. Contagions and harmful fungi that prefer overly moist soil can infect the grass and make the grass toxic for pets.

Definitely worth keeping an eye on. I don't fault the product though as mold growth has everything to do with moisture. The grass was lush, green, healthy, and the roots are strong and deep. 4 stars because it only lasted us a month but we will give it another shot.

"I bought these socks for my husband.  He is a runner and is outside all the time.  He sweats a lot and it is very damp where we live all the time.  His feet were always squishing in cotton socks and his socks were nasty in the laundry.  He insisted on his thick cotton Thorlo socks because they had padding where he liked it for long runs.  Finally!  I came across this moisture wicking Thorlo sock that has most of the same padding especially in the bottom areas.  He put them on after a race.  Now, let me tell you after a race, he is sweating so much he looks like he just stepped out of a shower.  Amazingly, his feet remained dry even though he was soaking wet everywhere else.  Afterwards, these socks did not pollute the laundry basket like the soaked cotton socks.  His only concern is they don't have quite as much padding on the top of the sock as his other cotton Thorlos so they may not be good for running down hills, but we don't have a lot of hills where we live.  So that isn't a problem unless we start travelling to running races again.",5.0,0

In general, I won't read a book unless it's rated 4 stars and above.  I really enjoyed this book.  The only reason that I don't give it 5 stars is that I realize that this is not a book for many people.  I enjoyed Harold's ride of life through the book.

I think his sex life is totally unbelievable but since I thought this book was filled with comedy, I took the sex sequences as part of the comedy.  I enjoyed the Nixon side of the book because I was around during his presidency and the mess he made of it.  I liked how Harold's life just grew around him, almost without him trying, because he was basically a nice guy.  Most families have some type of dysfunction in them and Harold's family has plenty.

"FEAR has a TV movie feel but it's actually somewhat above your average b-movie and Sheedy does a pretty good job with the material.  The antagonist and the storyline could have used a little more pep, but then it probably would have been even more like every other psycho-thriller.  It has some unique, if unlikely, aspects that pull me out of the movie a little.  Not that I totally discredit psychics, but the writer of this takes it to a new level that really could use something to give it a little more believability.  Still, this film has some tension at times.  Not worth the price of the set for it alone, however.  Now, same can't be said for PARENTS.  Truly, I bought this set for it alone and I was not disappointed.  I rented PARENTS when it first hit the video store and was blown away.  It made me seek out more black comedies.  It's really first rate and I was happy to find out it did hold up over the years.  The cast is great, the production design and storyline is terrific.

"I bought two of the Sugar Puppy Surprises, one for my 2 1/2 year old daughter and one for my 6 year old niece, for Christmas and they love them and haven't put them down! I had one as a kid and was thrilled when I saw they were remaking these and kept the look of the ones from 20 years ago instead of revamping the look like they do with all the remake toys. Sugar has very soft fur and I love the sparkly strands throughout her purple hair. The stitching on the dog is very well done and it seems durable.

Both of mine had 5 puppies so we were excited about that. Each puppy has a hard vinyl head with a soft body and a pink or blue bow around it's neck to determine if its a girl or boy. The puppies are about 4"" long and Sugar is about 15"" long. My niece's actually had a preemie puppy which was really cool! She was excited that there was a runt in the litter that was slightly smaller than the rest. I do wish the stomach hole in Sugar was a little deeper to accommodate all the puppies a little better but they do fit back in though it's a tight fit. They are very expensive on here and can be found cheaper at Target or Toys R Us. Simple but very fun toy and hands down their favorite gift this year!",5.0,0

If you know that going into it (and are still interested) it might be a good movie. But if you're expecting a movie about ""Another Earth"", forget it, you'll get none of that here, aside from a few musings of what it all might mean to us played on radios and TV's the characters have on now and then.

"My daughter liked the included doll and pet (note its only 1 pet, not 3 like the Amazon description says). She didn't like the house itself much and i cant blame her. Its a cute little house but one that is badly made.

You pretty much need to assemble everything which is a pain. I'd say it would be a good exercise for a kid but my 12 year old couldn't assemble it on her own. I probably spent 45min assembling it. Alot of the pieces didn't properly snap on and i have no doubt it will pop off with continual play. The door is horrendous, it easily open ands doesnt stay closed. The background of the house inside is just a cardboard you slot in. The finished product is a good size; not too big or too small.

They included like 50 small stickers and my daughter loves stickers though so she did have alot of fun sticking them on the house and customizing it.

"I love this water infuser! I've been using it to make cucumber/lime water to drink and I can't wait to try some other combos. It came with two free sphere ice molds which was nice but they kept leaking before I could get a good sphere. I more than likely won't be using them.

As for the water bottle it's been getting regular use in my house. Regular ice cubes fit well in the infuser insert and still leave room for any fruit or whatever you're infusing your water with.

The infuser insert was a little hard for me to pull out (it could just be me) but don't let that deter you from getting this bottle. There are slits on the sides of the infuser insert to let the water mix with whatever is inside the insert. You can even use the bottle without the insert if you'd just like to use it as a regular water bottle.

The top has a convenient handle to carry the bottle around and the plastic it's made out of is bpa free. The opening of the bottle is open and does not have a spout which in my opinion is much better because it makes it so much easier to clean.

Out of the couple infuser water bottles I've owned in the past, this one is getting the most use because it's a little bit easier to clean and convenient to carry around.

Mine did not come with the clips shown in the photo (on Amazon) that hold the gloves together when not in use.

  Aside from the interesting insights she gives regarding her own life (the way she writes in the book it sounds as if she's been through therapy) she also writes with quite a lot of sex appeal.  I'm not just talking about all the beautiful pictures but the way she talks about pleasure and sensuality.  As a woman I definitely found that this book helped reconnect me with my own sensuality.

"I didn't go to this movie in theaters because I didn't know what to expect. I thought it was going to be some complete comedy with no seriousness or reality. I proved myself wrong. It approached some common, but challenging issues single mothers go through. It provides an accent on the stress single moms deal inside themselves, and projects how challenging parenting can be when you're single.

With a little more detail: Their children were approximately in middle school and disobeyed rules (technically legal laws). The mothers were forced to work together from the schools regulations. They conflicted with each other at first. Each mom's situation is very different from the others. But a connection slowly formed revealing the similarities in the individual challenges, providing support for each other, and trying to enjoy life.

Also, men were added in the picture/story, but they are not the main focus of how the women handle the stress their life. Men were included because it relates to what single moms may go through with their ex-husband, or establishing/developing relationship with another man. It also provides a good closure for creating a positive ending, since movies can't continue going on and on, like someone's life does. The issues between the mom and child(s) also relate to what parents often experience anyway.

60kg for medium sized dogs
retractable dog leash. Made of environmentally protection material TPE. ABS has a nice rubber grasp that is easy to hold and your hand does not slip off.
you press down on the black button to lock  and release to let it go. 4 meter cord.
the light takes three triple a batteries ( you have to provide those)
the light is very bright which I love. I live in the country so it is dark at night to take out the dog it is nice to have a built in light I do not have to search for. you can also take the light off if you want and hold it in your hand. I like to leave it as one piece so I don't lose it.
really well made hard durable plastic and the end of the leash has light reflector so you can be seen in the dark by cars.
I like this one very much and my pomerian who is three pounds can use it just fine.",5.0,0
"My primary use for this toolbox is to keep inside of my truck.

I bought this product to replace my 19"" steel tool box that was your basic, tray ontop and storage below.  I never used a cantilever box before but i thought i could make good use of its space to keep my tools organized.

This toolbox really let me organize a lot more that i thought it would. I put all my ""everyday"" tools in the top 2 compartments. 1 side has a variety of screwdrivers and utility knives and the other side has adjustable wrenches, pliars and ratchets. In the middle compartments I used for my ""Special"" tools, 1 side has alan keys, tin snips, and the other side has my star screwdriver set and extra star bits. In the bottom compartment i have all my racthet sockets, a grease gun, a tool wrap with wrenches and a plastic storage box with bolts/screw/nuts.

The construction of the box is great, the paint job is profession grade. Smooth operation for opening and closing.

With the box closed (handles together) you can access the 2 top compartments just by flicking them open, really nice feature. You can also put a simple clip to keep them from opening on their own, or even a small lock if you'd like.

The item was shipped in its own manufacturer's box inside of another standard brown box.

I highly suggest this box to anyone that has tools and wants to keep them organized in one spot. There is a lot of room in this box and they made it the right size for things like long sockets to stand up next to eahother insted of stacking them ontop of eachother. I can look in my box and see exactly what i need and where it is. No more moving stuff around to get at the tool that I need.

"Ms. Hamilton continues to raise the bar in her latest, book 2 of the Highland Gardens time travel highland romance series, that is believable and history rich. It is filled with intrigue, finding love, and commitment to family. Finn is a high-powered modern rich man who longs for true love and a family like his cousin Laurie. He character is developed in such a matter that one has empathy and understanding that money and hotness doesnt always bring you happiness but more often loneliness and uncertainty as to who are your true friends and what true love is. Wow I love Elspeth, she is a strong woman but due to the era she was born and family duty puts love before family. Her character is truly thought provoking and though you want to scream don't take that from your fianc&eacute; we truly understand what the mens beliefs about women were back then compared to today. From my viewpoint there weren't any strong secondary characters but Caitrina and Douglas seemed to deserve a story.

"What a great little movie.  I had never heard of this, but it popped up on my recommendations and got good reviews, so I gave it a try.  This so much reminded me of Donald Westlake's comic crime caper novels.  A great little story with plenty of laughs.  The plot involves a group of low rent, misfit criminals trying to pull of a heist of a lifetime, or as the call it, their 'Bellini'.  Well, complications occur, problems arise, and the whole thing gets rather messy.  William H. Macy is great along with Isaiah Washington, Sam Rockwell, Michael Jeter, and Luis Guzman.

"ISBN 034536161X - Back to books related to WWII and religious artifacts. As a group, these books are interesting if only for the complete effect - from Ludlum's The Gemini Contenders to The DaVinci Code to Indiana Jones, the differences and similarities in the tales are fascinating. Indy begins the book by closing out his nearly lifelong chase after the Cross of Coronado. Ready for a return to the academic life, he returns late for the school year, only to find that his father is missing. Henry Jones has his own lifelong chase nearing an end - he appears to be within sight of the Grail Cup, and there are several groups of people who will do anything to beat him to it. Nazis, Henry's assistant Elsa, and a secret Brotherhood all have their eyes on the same prize, for their own reasons. Who will reach it first isn't nearly as important as who will be allowed to claim it. As adventure books on the subject go, The Last Crusade is an odd mix of lightheartedness and murder, which detracts from the excitement of the story in the book but played well in the movie.

"This book was given to me by the author and I was not compensated for my review.

I received an ARC in exchange for an honest review.

This is a great book. It is well written and the characters are well developed. This book is a great series for young and old. I have read the first book in the series and it is a great series. I look forward to reading the next book.This is a short novella about a couple who have been separated for years. The story is about a man who is forced to marry his wife in a marriage ceremony after she has cheated on him.

The story takes place in the small town of Fairfield, Illinois.  The town has been plagued with family drama.  The town's neighbors have been killed and the town is in turmoil.  The town is now facing a loss of residents.  When the town takes a chance on a town of its own, the town is able to try and save the town and its residents.

The author does a great job with this story.  The characters are well developed and the story is quick and fun.  I loved reading about the town's neighbors.  I was also very intrigued about the town's history.",5.0,1

"How many times do you find yourself in the kitchen with a sharp knife and an unprotected hand?  I can tell you I've got lovely scars from the times I've cut myself slicing a bagel or some other awkward item.  I no longer have a problem with cutting myself now that I have a pair of NoCry Cut Resistant Gloves.

The first thing that I did when I put my cut resistant gloves on was to run a knife across my hand.  I used a very sharp Chefcoo knife and it didn't pop even one thread.

I received a pair of large NoCry gloves, because I have large hands.  I found that they fit my hands perfectly without added gaps or sag.  My 21 year old son, who happens to be 6'5"", was not able to get his hand into a glove because his hand was so large.

The NoCry cut resistant gloves are made from a food grade, non-toxic material and with cutting-edge silica-based fibers and are completely machine washable.  I found that I still had full use of my hands and I didn't lose any sensitivity in my grip or handling.

I already appreciate having my pair of NoCry cut resistant gloves in my kitchen to protect my hands and the hands of my loved ones.  You'll love having a pair in your kitchen too.

"This is my second Kristan Higgins book, and while Ive long grown past reading straight-up romance novels  a staple of my jr. high and high school reading list  someone I trust recommended Higgins to me as smarter and more sarcastic than you average, cloying Harlequin formula and suggested I give her a try.

This is actually a sequel, of sorts, to The Best Man, the other Higgins novel I read, where it focuses on the romance of a side character from that novel in the same quirky upstate New York town. (Apparently, there are also several others featuring the same group of friends and family which Higgins has dubbed, The Blue Heron Series.)

Not quite as sharp as the Best Man, it did follow a similar path, with stubbornly single bar owner Colleen, who loves to set up everyone else, but resists falling in love herself after being badly burned by a former flame. And guess who happens to show up in Colleens bar one day? Yep, the one that got away, Lucas.

This isn't groundbreaking, and it gets to same destination as youd expect from a romance title, but Higgins does it with a lot more panache than your average rote, romance author. Witty dialogue, cliche-free conversation and a healthy dose of snark, all combined with a still sweet and, well, romantic romance.

Entertaining and perfect poolside reading, Ive heard the very smart Linda Holmes, of NPR, cite Higgins as one of the few contemporary romance authors she enjoys reading. Id have to agree.",4.0,0

"The why gives you charisma; the why gives you strength, purpose, and direction; the why separates you from the flock. This idea is undeniably powerful and deserves widespread attention.

Sinek gets to the heart of success by showing the importance of having a higher purpose, or why, behind everything you do. The 200+ pages of the book are elaborations on this single idea. Some might find that length repetitive or overdone, and at times it is; but overall, I found the length helpful in exploring the power and ramifications of the idea.

Considering the fundamental why helps any organization discover its authentic identity, make all decisions on the basis of that authenticity, and project an authentic image to the public. When you have a solid, authentic core, Sinek suggests, decisions are easier and buyers are more attracted to you because you have conviction and you're serving the world for a greater purpose other than merely selling widgets like everyone else.

Starting with why doesn't apply only to business. It applies everywhere, to every project you're working on. It applies to your identity and your life's work. If you think about it, even the greatest artists are those who have had compelling ""why""s.

Alternate titles for the book could be ""The Way of Why"" or, after Eckhart Tolle, ""The Power of Why."" Start with Why is a quick read, yet powerful enough to change your outlook on marketing and persuasion, powerful enough to help you become a more focused and productive person and to help you live a more meaningful life.

"Excellent adapter for my recess light. Despite the instruction from the seller about removing the ballast and same from many users, I did not remove the ballast in my recess can (don't know if it even has it). And it worked fine just plug and play. I did check the voltage on the terminals of my recess can which has the gx23 connector and it was 120v to confirm that the LED would work ok. I guess the ballast removal is required for some old CFL light, but if you can confirm 120v is the voltage out of your gx23 before plugging this adapter in then no need to worry about it.
Update: given that so many said about bypassing the ballast, I just did an experiment. I have 3 recess lights in the kitchen having the gx23 plug. I reopened one and bypassed the ballast. It's kind of pain doing that. The black (hot) wires are hard connected to the ballast (one in one out), so bypassing means cutting them off and reconnect. Note that to see the ballast, you need to unscrew a side screw in the recess can and then lower the top plate which has the gx23 mounted on it. you will see the ballast which is a little silver box attached to it. I only did the bypass for one of three lights just to see if anything changes. Now turned on the lights and I could not notice any difference! No humming noise from the ones with the ballast (not bypassed) either.",5.0,0

"My daughter seems to not get the hang of it.  She almost looks too big for it (she's 2) or the product seems to not inflate all the way (but we've inflated it to the max, where it seems like it's about to burst).  She falls off easily and doesn't bounce well on it.  I thought it would be like the videos but instead of bouncing up and down my daughter seems to lose her balance on it quickly.  Maybe it's just because when I first gave this to my daughter she was still trying to balance out having a large head (don't toddlers look like cute bobble heads, lol) but her balancing skills are much better now.  I'll try to give it to her again and see if she can play with it more now.  Before she would bounce and go flying off the thing but I think she's gotten more skills at balancing the past 4 months and will be able to use this more in the spring.  I like it because it's adorable and seems like it will be a ton of fun once she gets used to the concept.

"I put in a 200-a Square D ""QO"" panelboard when it was time to upgrade, and figured why not put this surgebreaker in at the time, I had slots open and it seemed like a good idea since the house is in rural countryside and has flakey power.
A couple years after- the tree in the front yard about 6' from the house took a direct lightning strike.
It fried our Invisible Fence controller (The wire ground loop carried the strike to the transmitter portion of the controller which was in an outbuilding) and it fried the modem in our DirecTV TiVO receiver (through the phone line which ran underground right by the Invisible Fence wires).
Nothing plugged into the AC was damaged, including three computers and other electronics in the room right by the lightning struck tree.
I can't complain about the two items that were damaged, it wasn't the fault of the Surge Breaker they were damaged. If you can use a screwdriver you can install this if you have two full-width slots available side by side in your breaker panel, but those slots are now eliminated from having breakers.

"This GPS served me fairly well (although my first update seemed to mess up its routing) for three years.  It routed in basic fashion, and did not surprise me too much.  The selection to favor back roads was especially good, and the POIs were quite extensive. Then I was recently ready to go on a long trip through the southern US and up the east coast. I was packed, turned it on and then NOTHING but the Magellan intro screen hanging there. System reset did not fix anything, and then it turned itself off.  In short, this a defective unit after three years of only occasional use. I stopped at a Walmart on the way of my trip and chose a TomTom Start 40M, which is a very nice unit that was up and running in 5 minutes. A bit quirkier than the Magellan, POIs are not as good, but it is quite smart in its routing. I expect electronics to last a lot more than three years.

"While I saw the movie before listening to the audiobook, I must say that I still really enjoy the main character. He's one of those guys you love to hate, but he's trying so hard to do the right thing, even if it means defending a scumbag who deserves a lot worse. Of course, since I had seen the movie already, I had an idea how it was going to end, but couldn't remember the specifics. Perhaps thats a measure of a great crime drama: all the misdirection makes it difficult to know whodunit, allowing future rereads to be enjoyable.

But, back to the main character, Mickey Haller, I think one of the reasons this book was a breeze to listen to was because the main characters POV is so well written. You can tell that he has some baggage from his father, which is partly why he defends everyone, regardless if they're guilty or not. The fact that Haller knows his way around the legal system and uses it to his advantage to even get the guilty an innocent ruling just shows that he takes pride in his work, even if it labels him as someone who keeps the crime on the streets.

The plus to this audiobook was also the narrator, who was awesome in bringing all the different characters to life with his voice acting. Even if the story is told from the point of view of the eponymous Lincoln Lawyer, there are plenty of interesting people in this book, and each one certainly has a different sound to them. Its the attention to these details that differentiates a narrator just reading a book to you and a voice actor who can bring the events happening in the words hes speaking to life.

A great start to an interesting crime drama series, I give The Lincoln Lawyer 4.0 stars out of 5.",4.0,0

"My children enjoyed this game when they were in the 2 to 4 year old range. There's a little memory practice going on combined with color matching.

To play the game a bunch of cardboard fish are placed color side down in the center of the play area. Each player is given a plastic boat with 4 slots in it. Players use a plastic fishing pole with a suction cup on the end to pick up fish from the center. If the fish matches their boat's color the player gets to put the fish in his or her boat. If it doesn't match the color then the fish goes back into the center. This is where the memory aspect comes in. The other players need to remember where a fish was placed back in the center if it happened to be of their color. It doesn't take much memory to remember one fish location until your turn comes around, but this is really for the very youngest game players. The first player to fill their boat wins. There is a variant that lets it use the numbers on the colored fish to play the classic go fish game of making sets and asking other players for matches. This variant stretches the age appropriateness up to maybe 4 years old. The Go Fish game lost its appeal for my children once the youngest was 4. They moved on to more advanced memory games like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Magic-Labyrinth-Board-Game/dp/B003RDJYMM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Magic Labyrinth Board Game</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hide-and-Eeek/dp/B003D7EPQM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hide and Eeek</a>&nbsp;after that.

The pieces are colorful and attractive. The game lasted fine through a couple of years of use. The suction cup worked okay for us. The game would probably work fine in a preschool classroom.

"Over the last several months, I have received several stainless steel tumblers to test and review.  My husband is the hunting and fishing manager for an international chain sporting goods store, so we also receive a lot of stuff that they sell in the stores, to test at home.  Some of the first tumblers we were sent to try were from Yeti, and so many other brands have followed... Epic, Kodiak, Magnum Steel, Sic-sup, Rtic, and many more more.  This was the most recent cup that we have gotten to try.  We live in Texas, so we like ice cold drinks while we sit in the blazing hot sun.
After hand washing this cup, allowing it to air dry, it was filled with ice, and topped off with water.  Then is was off to the lake for a day in the hot sun! This cup performed very well throughout the day, and was even adopted by my father's girlfriend by the end of our trip.  (I usually give them to family or friends anyways, because we have several still)
The ice that we put in the cup early in the day lasted until we headed back home that night.  We refilled the water a few times, and did top the ice off throughout the day, but it kept the ice and drink just as cold as the other cups like this, that we had taken out there.
Not all of these tumblers perform as well as the top branded ones, but a few of them do stand out as being very good investments.  This cup is one of them! If it had not already been taken home by someone else, we would have been keeping it.

"Update:
What a difference a few hours can make!  I originally rated this blender at 3 stars earlier today and have now changed my rating to 1 star after using the blender a second time - after using it extremely lightly twice it cracked near the blade (see the product picture I've uploaded).  I was blending liquids so I can't imagine this thing surviving crushing things as the description states.  If you're smart you'll avoid this blender and pay a few more dollars for one that's more durable.

Original review:
This is a nice basic hand/stick blender.  The price was right for what I needed it for - purchased for soap making so I didn't want to spend a ton of money on it.  That being said, I'll probably look for a different one the next time around because this one ended up being bigger and more awkward than I was expecting and I have large hands (if I had smaller hands I definitely wouldn't like using it).  The end with the blade detaches for cleaning which is nice but the blade assembly itself doesn't.

Pros:
Price

Cons:
The whole thing is bigger than I expected and it's awkward to hold and use (you'd have a hard time using it in a glass to blend something small)
The blade doesn't come off for cleaning

"OK.  There are multiple, varying reviews on these boots.  Some people say that they are a little big, some say they're ridiculously big... IF YOU OWN ANY OTHER TIMBERLAND SHOES OR BOOTS, JUST ORDER ONE FULL SIZE SMALLER THAN THOSE.

The confusion is that Timberlands (in every other case) run big and require you to wear a half size smaller than normal.  Therefore, if you don't own any Timberlands, order these ONE AND A HALF sizes smaller than your normal shoe size.  Period.  I usually wear a 12.  In Timberlands I wear an 11.5 and in these I needed a 10.5 (yes, this is all ridiculous and I actually can't believe I'm writing all of this right now).

Summary:
Timberlands in general - minus a half your normal size.
THESE Timberlands - minus one and a half your normal size.

These boots are awesome, light, not clunky, soft feeling footbed, nice arch support, look great and I really like them. 4 stars instead of five for the ridiculously stupid sizing and forcing me to get involved.

"Why you should read it: This has been one of my favorite reads this month, and I definitely recommend it to fans of the twisted and strange. Brandon is a bad boy who uses his image to hold the world at bay, and uses his hacking skills to keep the world at arm's length. Our heroine, Emma, really sees him, which is why I think Brandon really connects with her. Now on to the plot! I think some readers will have a hard time suspending disbelief, but if you do it's a really, really intriguing concept. Without giving too much away, the mirrors are a separate ""world,"" and Brandon can hack them from his computer. His reflection, Obran, is everything he is  and isn't. My husband works with coding and computers, so when I read aloud some of the coding and hacking, he thought the idea was really cool and promptly went to look at his reflection. For tech-oriented readers and those looking for something different, I'd recommend Duplicity and am eagerly awaiting the next installment!

"As always, I am SMITTEN with Tessa Dare's characters and the situations they find themselves in. If nothing else, the cakes incident would have sealed the deal for how awesome Rafe was. Yet, there was so much more to this big, lovable rake.

Admittedly, I'm a sucker for couples who have to wade through a shared past before they can come to terms with a future. And Rafe? He certainly had some lingering issues about himself and his likability. It took a while before he was convinced Clio really might want him for who he was.

Then there's Clio. She of the eight year engagement. I have to admit I found her family a little unbearable. Not her whole family. Just Daphne and her husband. I totally get why she put up with her sniping and such, but I spent the majority of their interactions waiting for Clio to snap and tell her off. To be fair, Clio's veneer of politeness was mighty thick and I knew it would take a while for her to find the backbone to step up and deal with Daphne. (Also to be fair, Daphne's sniping worked given what we were told about their mother and that her actions were the ones Daphne learned from.)

Meanwhile, Rafe and Clio together made me smile. His roughness against her polite breeding. His kisses....oh, his kisses. I really, REALLY liked those. Not to mention Clio's cake noises. Because a good cake totally deserves cake noises.

"Mounted this on the stem of a Schwinn Excursion bike.  Easy to install with the provided O-Rings.  Wireless sensor mounted easily as well with its own O ring.  The spoke magnet was a little tricky to install but once I had it oriented the right way (directions are not crystal clear) it went off without a hitch.  The wheel sensor has a little green led that flashes when it detects the magnet so you can test the distance between magnet and sensor to make sure its correct and working.

The display comes setup for handle bar mounting but instructions are clear and simple if you need to change its orientation on the base plate for stem mounting.  The computer twists off the base plate so you can pocket it and walk away when leaving the bike locked up in a  dicey area.  The instruction book comes with a tire chart so you can set tire size without having to measure anything.

Keep in mind that the display never actually turns off; when it detects no activity for a while (15? minutes) it switches to standby mode and just shows computer model number.  Even with that the battery (CR2032) is said to last a year in both the computer and speed sensor so we will see.

The instruction booklet is a little dense as every page repeats the instruction in 5 or 6 languages but fairly simple to follow.",5.0,0

"Overall does what a hub should do. Works 100% with powered devices like printers and scanners. But it doesn't like iPods: the connection will be lost (not a good idea to disconnect an iPod without ""ejecting"" it), or no connection will be made at all, or the port on the computer where the hub is connected will lock up.

Also, the build quality is poor. The silver finish is uneven, even worn off (out of the box) in a few spots. And the clear cover over the LED indicators is falling off.

Perhaps Belkin's new ""Plus"" hubs are better, but I'm not willing to find out.

"I received this tool as a gift. It is well made and very useful, especially with trim molding and almost anything that requires an angle on the sliding miter saw. However, the scale was misaligned by one full degree. I called Starrett and was told that their tolerance for this tool is +/- one degree. That is unacceptable from a company like Starrett renowned for their  precision. I exchanged the tool for another, hand selected from inventory, and found one just .1 degree misaligned after looking at a dozen or so. This is workable accuracy but IMO the tool should be engraved, and the scale should be accurate or the scale should be eliminated. The decal itself may be accurate but the application process seems to produce a fair number of these tools with misaligned scales. With a sliding miter saw this is not really a problem as you can just transfer the angle. But, if the scale is there it should be accurate or at least installed properly. With the scale accuracy problems it rates three stars. If the scale were properly installed and accurate, I would give it 5 stars. Then I would not have to use my engraved Starrett protractor to read the actual angle when needed.",3.0,0

I was provided with a free sample for evaluation,

These are fairly priced cycling gloves that don't skimp on workmanship or comfort. I used the sizing chart and measuered my palm size as instructed. It indicated that size Large would be my size so that's what I ordered. They fit perfectly.

These are a 3-panel design and made of a microfiber suede material in combination with EVA padding and a stretch nylon. I find them to be really comfortable, particularly around the top of the glove. Some gloves I've used can be irritating around my wrist either because they go up to high on the wrist or because the material is a little stiff or abrasive. These were just great in that regard, not stiff or abrasive, not too high... just right. The velcro closure was also not too excessively long or too skinny, it was just right.

There is nice patch of microfiber on the thumb for wiping sweat off your face and small tabs on two of the fingers enable you to pull these off your hands more easily.

Not too  much padding but just the right amount for me, The padding is not gel, like many gloves, buy EVA foam. I hope that it holds up with repeated use... most of my gloves have used gel so I'm not sure what to expect from the EVA foam.

Overall I'm impressed with these. The price is fair and I feel these gloves can compete well with more expensive, better known brands.",5.0,0

"After watching Hypocrites, it is interesting to me that even in the early years of filmmaking, movies could be extremely complex and thought provoking. Hypocrites is definitely those two things. The writer and director of the film, Lois Weber, uses the characters of a preacher and Truth (portrayed as a naked woman) to reveal the hypocrisy of society. Though Weber's intentions were most likely to speak on morality, it is interesting that she chose to use a fully nude woman throughout the film to draw in an audience that would not have otherwise seen the film. It was also surprising to me that this film would have been viewed by religious audiences with such unapologetic nudity. However, I will say that whatever could be viewed as indecent may have been made up for by the moral of the film. As the preacher succumbs to a dream, he is taken to an earlier time when he first finds Truth. The preacher then goes around aiming to show Truth to people, only to get rejected every time. In each situation, Truth reveals the true character of people to be corrupt. I feel that the overall story of the film was very well written. However, I found it a little bit difficult to get into the film because of the melodramatic style of acting. Because there was no sound in film at the time, the acting seemed to be more expressive and a lot less realistic. If anything made this film difficult to watch, it would be that. Although, overall I enjoyed the film and felt that Weber was successful in presenting her case of morality. I would be interested in seeing what a modern cast and crew could do with the story. I would love to see someone else's spin on it.",3.0,0

Both are jobs that can involve cutting, prying open, grabbing hot or sharp things, etc.  I saw this as a good tool to keep in my car to use ""just in case"" I had a chance to be a hero, like my friends. But first, I brought it to church to show my firefighter friend and get his thoughts. Here's what he said:

He thought it was a little heavy to carry but he thought he would be able to substitute it for a couple of other tools he carries. He liked the combo pliers/wire cutters and saw how they could be used to turn, bend or cut through wires or grills. He immediately recognized the key slot that could close gas valves. The pry bar end too could be useful to open stuck doors or smash windows. Finally, and the reason for only 4 stars, the fire hose tightened isn't very useful since he say that you really need two to snug up the joint.

Quality build, several useful tools, a little heavy, worth a try for the heros in your life!",4.0,0

"The first few chapters were very hard to get through, because they described a lot of  domination and brutality. It was hard to read how the Normans and Vikings treated these women and innocent servants. I'm not a big fan of rape in romance novels (although I seem to remember it being popular in the 70's) but it is historically accurate. I didn't like Wulfgar forcing the heroine to have sex with him. It was very difficult for me to like him after that. He treats her so badly that it's abusive, and I didn't warm up to him until towards the late middle of the story.

There's a lot of melodrama in this novel. At times Aislinn seems bi-polar, swinging back and forth between rage and happiness within one scene. Her mother acts so hysterical and goofy she's unbelievable. The female villains are horrible but it was kind of fun reading about them.

The language the author uses is meant to sound medieval, and at times it was hard to follow what the characters were saying. It got a little formal and flowery at times, and slowed the story down for me.

There is a real romance in there!  I did warm up towards Wulfgar. The characters did seem more believable and sympathetic towards the middle of the story. Towards the late middle to the end I could not put it down.",3.0,0

"Never heard about this one, but ended up glued right through to its end. Great find! A dark comedy about a teenager's frustration with setting out on the road to self-discovery and coming to a dead end.

The dialogue is nimble, the music apt, and the screenplay a refreshing change from the pat assembly-line teenybop flicks cranked out several times a year by Hollywood. The plot is peripheral, it's the characters and a fluid narrative that take center-stage.

As delightfully droll but cynical 17 year-olds facing the first challenges of adulthood -- leaving home, getting a job, finding a love life -- the two female protagonists do a fabulous job of coming across as outsiders among their peers never quite trying to ""fit in"".

In what begins as a harmless goof, one of them finds herself drawn to schleppy forty-something Seymour (Buscemi), a regular Joe and collector of 78rpm records. You know Buscemi from character roles in a bunch of popular movies, including Reservoir Dogs; all pent-up cynicism and inherent geekiness, he couldn't be more perfect in this role.

Thrown in are other interesting caricatures of some pretty credible small town characters, notably an art teacher who got more inane with every highfalutin bit of art she expounded on high school kids.

Thankfully, the movie resists the temptation of convenient closures so some may take issue with how it all turns out for the teenage girl and the middle age geek. But it feels more real this way.

This is the only toy I have that will last me long enough to have a longer tail, but it is not a great toy for a small dog.  My dog loves this toy. ",5.0,1
"Ahh...such a pretty cover that contains a book that is really nothing special.  But, I've read the Vampire Kisses series by Schrieber, so I was kind of expecting it.

I actually liked Celeste and I liked Brandon.  Celeste is different than the typical teenager in her crowd.  It stands out right from the beginning.  She goes with the flow because it's the easy thing to do.  She didn't want to loose her friends by rocking the boat.  I wasn't surprised by it.  I also liked how Brandon is different.  He doesn't fit it with either crowd.  It's especially interesting when we learn about his life at his previous school.  I also like the chemistry between Celeste and Brandon, that is until it got a little over the top.  It's like an inevitable part of teen fiction sometimes.

I wasn't particularly found of Celeste's friends.  They seemed so shallow.  And Nash was just not likable at all.  I was expecting a love triangle type of things.  But, Nash was hard for me to swallow.  I also didn't really like the town divided thing.  It just didn't work with the story in my eyes.  The actual legend of the werewolf was different.  It was really tame compared to other stories.  But, then again it fits into the author's idea of vampires in her other series.

So, will I read the next one?  I'm not sure.  This was ok, but it didn't really stand out in any way.  But, the author's other series did get progressively better with each book, so I might give the next installment a go.",3.0,0

"Terrible product.

Does not support ""Wireless AP"" mode. Even if you manually disable DHCP, turn off SPI firewall, plugin  using LAN ports, it still restricts access to lan devices.

Also, it has LOTs of bugs including:
-Cannot allow WAN administration  from any BOGON networks. It looks like you can, but then errors out. Before applying settings
-By default it has vLAN tagging on port 3 and 4. but documentation does not tell you.
-Web admin interface is NOT httpS, and has no option to enable https.
-DNS is forcefully bound to the WAN port, thus to use it as a Wireless AP you must have a LAN cable attached... AND a LAN cable.
-Wireless defaults to use captive portal, even with guest Network turned off. So you have to enable guest Network, disable captive portal, click save, then disable guest Network again and NOW the non-guest network will work like it should. GAH! No way should anyone have to deal with this junk...

I have been trying to tell myself to just accept this devices issues, but even after hours of changing settings, it is impossible to make it work like it is supposed to. It is not even consistent, sometimes it will not let you connect, or will start dropping packets, so I have to use my old wireless as it, while older technogy, is reliable.

ONLY good thing about this device... the wireless range is very good. Unfortunately because some days it decides to just drop packets randomly, the range benefit is useless :(

*Note: TP-Link devices are ONLY good if you wipe original firmware and use OpenWRT. I have an older WDR4300 and a WDR810, with OpenWRT they work well... just old technology, unfortunately because Archer C9 uses Broadcom chip you cannot use OpenWRT.",1.0,0

"I appreciate this book on so many levels, I don't know where to even start this review. The Life List by Lori Nelson Spielman is a study of a person's transformation from a life being led to a life worth leading. The journey, however, is not without its own set of trials and tribulations.

When we meet Brett, the main character, she is the picture of success with the entire package of successful trappings: friends, love, professional achievement, and a life in the great city of Chicago.  It is only when Brett's mother passes away from cancer that the layers begin to peel away and we see what's going on beneath the surface.

To further exacerbate the situation, Brett is fired from her job by a sister-in-law who receives a promotion in the family business that had been promised to Brett. Through a series of events, it comes to Brett's attention that it was, in fact, her mother who has orchestrated some of the events Brett is being forced to deal with. The biggest and seemingly most undoable is for Brett to look back on a list of goals she made when she was just 14 and as is stipulated by her mother's attorney, in order to receive the inheritance from her mother, she must complete ten of the items on the list immediately. Dealing with the list and some of the goals penned as a young girl seems, well, difficult and impossible (get a horse?) particularly since she is in a state of grief.

Working through the list at first is challenging but watching her grow and evolve as she tackles each item, is miraculous, amidst surprise upon surprise but I will leave those surprises to be discovered by the reader.

I really enjoyed this and am sure others will too.

"My ferret loves this Vitamin Supplement! I love this product and have purchased it for almost 5 years and will continue to purchase it for the well-being of my girl.  I give it to her every day by breaking up the amount into two servings so, that she can enjoy it in the morning, and in the evening.

This supplement has kept her very healthy, her coat is very shiny, and her appetite is very good.  My ferret is very small and this has kept her weight on because it provides her with a healthy appetite.  My vet recommended this item to me during my first visit because she is so small, and keeping weight on her is very important.

What I love most about this item is how crazy my girl gets when she sees the tube, she does a cute little dance, and fluffs up her coat.  She could be in the other room and I will tap the tube in my hand and she will come running.  This is a great company that makes great products and has kept my ferret healthy. This Vitamin Supplement has a good list of vitamins for their overall health.  Most of all the taste seems to be very appealing to my girl.

I would recommend this item to any ferret owner as a supplement and also if you are having problems getting your ferret to eat or maintain weight, give her or him some of this prior to their meal and their appetite should be good to go in about 10 minutes or so.  Sometimes their appetite could be affected by hairballs so I would also recommend adding a hairball aid to their weekly health regime and after baths too.",5.0,0

"If you're a fan of Inkheart and of science fiction or alternate reality, this is the perfect for you. In this alternated world in 1985 in Britain, time travel is routine, cloning is a reality (dodos have been resurrected,) and literature is taken very seriously. People can get lost in poems and stories, and first editions are forged. This is all usual for Thursday Next, a literary detective. But then someone begins kidnapping characters from stories. And when Jane Eyre is kidnapped, Thursday has to track down the villain and go into the novel herself. This is a really great book; playful and wonderful. I loved the world-building in the book, though there were a lot of specialized terms that you had to learn to make sense of the story. Also, I really liked the character of the villain, Acheron Hades. He was so deliciously evil. And seemingly invincible. Fforde's writing style was really great too; you know, that British style. It was straightforward but also had dry humor. And action, but not too much action. Fforde is actually from Wales, I think.

This is easy to assemble and might be confusing when you consider that it comes with 16x the amount of screws needed for any TV.  However, all you will need are the 4 nuts, 8 small allen head screws and 4 acorn nuts and you can assemble it in 5-10 minutes reusing the original screws on the back of your TV.

After quick assembly, I mounted them on my new 70"" Vizio E70 that weighs around 70 pounds and thought that the legs might not be sturdy enough.  After placing the TV on my smallish TV stand, the legs somehow feel like they transfer the weight of the TV to the bottom center and the TV feels very stable.

As much as I love the Reeboks for what they do well (grip, drain, etc.), my knees need more cushion.  I did a ton of research and came to the conclusion that the Salomon Speedcross 3 has the most cushion of any trail shoe.

"This is truly a fantastic little class d amp with good clarity and enough punch to drive a few bass notes.

I have used a variety of these little class d type amps over the years to drive aux sound in spare rooms, garage and the like.  Most all of these amps were good for what I used the, for but just did not have that clarity nor reserve power needed to get truly good sound out of them.  After a while I would find all of them just okay but not amazing like I had hoped.
now granted I realize these are inexpensive little amps and I can not or should not compare them with say a Rotel, Yamaha or Harmon kardon so that is not what I am looking for.  But I do like to have nice clean sound with a lil bass at times.

When we needed something extra to go with the sound bar connected to our main tv I just did not want to go all home theater on the set up - it is just too expensive, too bulky and too power hungry.  What I wanted was to drive my Polk bookshelf speakers with the 3.5 mm jack off my tv which would work with my volume control also.

Did some searching and came across this sweet little mama jama and figured why not - if I don't like it I send it back, right?  Well wow is all we can say.  Got this in a jiffy, hooked it up and connected my polks.  This sucker sounds amazing - crystal clear highs and nice rumbly lows are coming across consistently without any sign of distortion or excess heat being generated by the amp.

Do not hesitate - grab one of these units now before they realize it should be priced higher!!",5.0,0

"At this price this rig is a steal. Rigs are priced way too high and it's often hard to find a rig at an affordable price. Without writing a huge written review I'll tell you the good things about this rig, the bad things, and the one reason why I think one should by this as soon as they can.

Pros:
-Decent Build quality (not amazing but decent)
-Follow Focus included
-Matte Box included
-Light weight
-Quick release mount
-Price
-Easy to put together
-15mm Rod System

Cons:
-Matte box is plastic. Everything is built well but the matte box for some reason.
-No rise mechanism for the follow focus (If DSLR has a battery grip, you can't use the FF. I'm trying to find a possible solution).
-Rails are pretty short.

Why I think one should buy this?
-You get a matte box and FF for a cheap price.
-Up-gradable (You can add on things later on)
-15mm Rods allow you to change to a different matte box or FF if you choose to upgrade one day.

"To Live and Die in L.A. was a film ahead of its time. When it was released in 1985, it failed to connect with a mainstream audience that was put off by its amoral, unlikable characters and downbeat, nihilistic ending. What did people expect from the same man who brought them the equally uncompromising The French Connection in 1974? William Friedkin's film has long been out of print on VHS and so MGM's new special edition DVD is exactly what fans of this influential crime thriller have been waiting for.
Director William Friedkin provides an informative audio commentary that pulls no punches. He goes into detail about the world of counterfeiting and the Secret Service. For those who enjoyed his commentary on The French Connection DVD, this new track is a must-listen.
""Counterfeit World: `The Making of To Live and Die in L.A.'"" is a wonderful retrospective look at how the movie was made. There is some excellent archival, behind-the-scenes footage of Friedkin and his cast in action. Fans are in for a real treat as the fantastic airport foot chase between Petersen and Turturro is discussed, as is the famous car chase on the Los Angeles freeway. This featurette is crammed with tons of anecdotes and new interviews with Petersen, Pankow and Dafoe.
Also included is an alternate ending that the studio forced Friedkin to shoot because they didn't like his original downbeat ending.
There is also a deleted scene that fleshes out Pankow's character a bit more.
To Live and Die in L.A. was William Friedkin's last great film. He has failed to deliver anything on the level of his 1985 film. MGM has produced an excellent DVD with a stunning transfer (including a new 5.1 surround soundtrack) and a solid collection of extras that should please fans of this crime thriller masterpiece.",5.0,0
"OK first of all at this point I thought the author was a bit of a prude and I wasn't too impressed with the story.  The heroine was a bit of a golem with a bad attitude and in the end she was a bit of a loner.  The book had a bit of a romance going on between the two characters and it was a little predictable.  I just didn't care for the heroine's actions.  I don't think I will read more about her in future books.

Overall, I loved this story.  I just didn't get it.  It was a bit slow paced, but it kept my interest.  I'll be looking for more by this author.I love this series, and this story is awesome. It's a great story about a strong woman who is",5.0,1

"What would have happened if I got that letter when I was supposed to? Danny Collins (Pacino) is a rock star who peaked years ago. He is coasting through life playing concerts when he can and playing the same songs over and over. When he is shown a letter that John Lennon wrote him many years before he rethinks his life and career. With a new look at life he heads to New Jersey to find the son he never knew and start writing again. As many of you know by now I am a huge Pacino fan. I think he is the greatest actor working today but some of his recent movies I haven't been a big fan of. He was great in The Humbling but I thought the movie was a little slow. This is a role that seemed like a stretch for him (he does his own singing) but because he is so great he pulls it off and it seems like a role he was made for. The movie is very fun and easy to watch. The cast is great and the writing is funny and heartfelt. Only an actor like Pacino can turn a clichd cheesy line like some dinners are worth fighting for into something that is meaningful. Overall, I am a little biased because Pacino is my favorite actor but this is a great movie and his best movie in a few years. I give it an A.",4.0,0

"As you all know, when Im reviewing a book Im big on storyline, character development and connection not only between the characters, but connecting with the book as well.

As far as sexual chemistry, Sky and Ford had it in spades. Every time they looked at one another they were either undressing each other with their eyes or bumping uglies like Jack rabbits. This book definitely didn't lack in the sex department. You were left with nothing less than pure blissful satisfaction, definitely no problem there.

Though Sky and Ford got off on the wrong foot in the beginning, you were able to see how there could be a connection between them once they started opening up to each other and realized they had quite a bit in common. I felt a bit torn because for me, their connection felt more rushed than natural.

Sadly that is kind of how I felt about Repair Me overall. The storyline was good but too much was happening too fast. Every time I would start to connect with the book and really get into it, another scenario was thrown at me to deal with but there wasn't enough time before the book ended for it to feel natural. Either the book needed to be longer or some of the situations needed to be left out in order for the story to develop naturally and really be able to sink your teeth into the book.

"I installed this faucet on my garage sink because of its constant use and the profile of the vertical position of the filter.  Installation is a snap and simple.  I did it with no problem and that's a bundle to say.  I waited this long to be sure the filter worked and the unit had the longevity that I expected and with each issue the unit is flawless.  My water comes directly out of the ground in the back yard, goes through about 400 feet of pumping and then another 200 feet of pipe to get it into the house before it goes into the water holder.  Whew, what a trip.  No wonder it takes rainwater over 6 months to seep down to the water level.  After the water comes into the holding system it is then sent into the house pipes upon demand.  It goes through a wound cord filter and then a charcoal filter before it finds its way to the PUR-3.  I know that's a long route and story but I wanted to be sure I gave the facts as best I could.  The PUR-3 did it's job.  It provided me with as clean a water as I could ask for.  No, it is not distilled water but it is close.  I checked it for obvious solids and other discolorations and it was as clean as I could expect because I found not the first foreign item.

I considered giving this a 5 star and did not because the amount of water coming out the faucet is significantly less than the water coming out of an unfiltered tap.  That reduced my use of the faucet from time to time such as washing the dogs or preparing water for use in cleaning paint brushes.  Removal and remounting the faucet is as easy as can be and is not an issue.  I recommend this unit without any exception and the water flow is more my problem then that of PUR.  Good drinking.",4.0,0

"The even spread of 5 star through 1 star comments here reflect the subjective experience of the viewers more than any film I have seen recently. Now in his eighties, Eastwood directs a film whose theme lies close to heart of all people who have matured as they have aged. It is a reflection on the possibilities of the afterlife that we all think about as we age. Eastwood offers no answers but instead gives us 3 parallel stories of people who have experienced death or near death; a woman drowned in a tsunami, a psychic who sees his ability as an affliction, and a young boy who loses his twin to death. Each protagonist searches for answers, as we all do. Viewers may not be satisfied by that lack of concrete solutions but a film about death and acceptance can have no other ending. Some viewers may be fooled by the opening tsunami sequence into thinking that this is an action film. The absorbingly realistic set of CGI sequences that open the film makes other CGI laden films look artificial and lame. But it  is not an action film though studio marketing may have given people that idea. In lesser hands a film like this would be filled by after death pseudo babble that has been all to common in American cinema over the decades. Entertaining but trivial films such as 'Ghost' are pedestrian but pleasant to watch. TV shows like 'Medium' were light silly but enjoyable time wasters. Eastwood does nothing like that here. Instead this is a film for people who think, those who are at the end of life, and those who have had life threatening experiences. Highly recommended.",5.0,0

"The price and comfortability of this mask were the 2 best things about it, which are 2 very important things to have in a mask. The negative, for me, was the fogginess. I have never used a tempered glass mask before, but I did the toothpaste treatment to is twice before use, and lo and behold it fogged pretty quickly and easily. Just like any other mask I have had. I expected it to work better than it did. When not fogged the vision is very clear and the fit is nice. I have an average sized nose, but a bit of a larger head, and this fit well.
It is possible that I do not know what I am doing with the treatment before first use, but I think I did things correctly. I want to recommend the mask because everything about it is great except the fogging, and to me that is a huge piece of what I would call a good mask or goggles. So instead I give it 3.

"Love this harness. We have 3 bigs dogs that we walk regularly and before we switched to this harness and Halti double leads they pulled us around the block. We actually use the leads as ""anchors"". We strap the lead around our waist and connect the other end to the front clip of each dog's harness. We then use our old regular leads to clip to the harness right between the shoulder blades. I can't say they don't pull at all with these harnesses but it has decreased significantly. (It's our own fault because we haven't properly trained them to not pull, but who has time for that). Using the leads like this also gives us a much more control over them. It used to feel like they would pull my arm out of my socket but now when they do pull (if they see a cat or squirrel and they try to lunge) they are trying to pull against my whole body weight at my center of gravity and get no where fast.

The snarky, sassy personalities had me laughing and at times cringing at their crazy, yet courageous acts. Willow is incredibly strong and doesn't hold back. This makes for, at times, a hilariously volatile interaction with Mal. Mal is your alpha male with an overprotective personality. Oh yeah they are complete opposites!

Great driver. I have a small 9mm Glock 17 and this is by far my favorite.  The grip is adjustable and the front sight is also adjustable.  The cover is very sturdy and it keeps my gun from getting caught in a crossfire.  I use it for hiking and also for a 2 day outdoor bike ride. ,5.0,1
"I've heard a lot about this book and the movie. I'm not sure if I'm one of those people.  The movie, ""A Moon Shaped Pool"" is very good.  The book is excellent.

"my old battery drill needed another set of batteries (the second set).  they are expensive so I thought I might just replace it.  many of the reviews were saying the newer ones were more powerful, efficient and yet lighter.  I did my research and bought this one.

"When I first saw the film, I thought it was a bit boring, but I was wrong.

The film is filled with gore and sex, and the acting is very good.

The movie is in English, so it is not as violent as some people would have you believe.

The acting is good, but the visuals are not very good.

There is a great scene with the young woman who is on a train with a camera, and her boyfriend, who is on a train with a camera, and the two women are sitting together in the front seat.

The movie is mostly about women, but the scenes with the young man and the woman are really good.

The movie is in French, so it is not as violent as some people would have you believe.

The story is good, but the characters are not very good.

The movie is in Spanish, so it is not as violent as some people would have you believe.

"Feels durable when used, and yes, I've used it: Well, the bottle opener, anyhow! The day it came in, I put it on my neck before we went to dinner. My wife ordered the ""glass bottle"" (Mexican) Coke. The waiter said, ""Oh, I forgot my bottle opener, hang on a minute."" and I almost yelled, ""No, no! Wait! I've got a bottle opener."" And I dug this little guy out of my shirt, and pffft, opened that sucker right up! I mean, when does that ever happen? Maybe two times in 40 years has someone said to me, ""Uh oh, forgot a bottle opener"" and I got the best chance ever to show off my sweetie!

So, I can see using the bottle opener once in a while, the screw driver, the knife. I'm not sure how often I'll use the knife or the wire stripper. But like a wise reviewer previously said, it's nice to have a little fixed blade that doesn't make me look like some sort of paranoid knife nut. As I've already proven, this little knife (and tool!) is helpful.

PS For those of you who like a small knife for self defense (I carry a semiautomatic pistol and pepper spray instead) and want this because it's unobtrusive, keep this in mind: There is an almost exact same model sold by Shadow Ops. It's about the same price. Hell, it might even be the same knife. But if you're looking for non-tactical-looking, remember that the other knife says, very clearly on it: SHADOW OPS. If the law pats you down, it's harder, I imagine, to say that your Shadow Ops knife is harmless.",5.0,0

"I bought the ""pro pack"" It just comes with all of the filter media (Ceramic Rings, Carbon, and Bio Rings) And extra white and blue filter pads. This filter is easy to set up as long as you do everything right, It took me a while at first until I realized that the motor head wasn't put in right(Made a loud gurgling noise). but after that it worked perfect, the only noise you hear is a little hum. I've had it for about 2 weeks. and it has been keeping the the water crystal clear! which amazed me because turtles dirty water so much so fast. So I'm pretty amazed, I'd say the water clarity has never dropped below 90%. and I love it, This is a fantastic canister filter for the price, I'd recommend this to anyone looking for a good cheap canister, I really have nothing bad to say besides every once in a while I have to pump air out of it (I have aerators and live plants so my oxygen levels are really high) And it pulls the little microscopic bubbles through and they build up into bigger air bubbles. And one of my plants got sucked into the filter and clogged it (outtake was low flow), and the extra filter pads that came with were TOO BIG for the filter (I cut them to size). But as of right now everything works fantastic and I have no complaints otherwise. Just care for it properly, set it up right, and good luck!!",4.0,0
