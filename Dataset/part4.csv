"5'6"" and 125. I have literally tried on about 30 pairs of jeans this year. Gap, Lucky Brand,Express,Saks, Macy's,seriously if they are known for their jeans have been there. Who is shaped that way.? A mid-rise jean is not 10 inches from your crotch to your waist? Legs so tight they all wound up inside out , crotch up on the dressing room floor! Sorry to the help but when the leg openings are so tight I am wrestling them off they can untangle the wretched things. The mid-rises hit half way up my back! I am 65 years old so white jeans are very tricky. These are perfect. I hate paying this much for a single pair of jeans but I am NOT sending these back as I expected to.. Good weight and still not see through? I thought they were going to be lightweight and they are but not too thin/thick. The rise is a perfect 8 inches/zipper 4 inches and the leg openings allow someone with a calf muscle to move  and they don't ride up. I've had them on about 3 hours now and yeah they stretch out a little but in a good way. I can sit cross legged on my bed w/o discomfort! But these jeans! I don't care what color just get a pair before these sell out. I may buy another color myself. I tried to get a shot of my ass in but it wouldn't download! If these make a 65 yr old old lady look good- you'll rock them!",5.0,0

"Cons:
Biggest con: cables sometimes not long enough. Also, it REQUIRES A DRIVER. Will not work properly without it.
I got this unit so I can run a dekstop and laptop together. A few things to note... the vga cables are short an dthe attached usb cable is short but appears to work on most pc's as long as the ports needed are open. The vga cable being short meant that I had to purchase a vga extension cable.
As mentioned switching isn't instantaneous etc.
5 second delay to get the mouse recognized.
Also I may be wrong but the usb appeared to be needed to be plugged in for the switch to work or detect.
At the beginning I also encountered trouble with installing the driver.
The windows 7 machine works flawlessly. The xp machine appears to not detect that the belkin is connected. However it still outputs a signal and works. I just can't use software switching. Only the hardware using the button.
Also the monitor plugs are tough to connect but work fine.

Biggest pro:
The big simple switch. I wish it was longer to reach me but the switch is very useful. Just tapping it with my foot does the job. I haven't tried out the audio so I can't comment on how well it works. I also haven't tried connecting usb 2 devices to it.
I give it 3 stars because of the software trouble and trouble getting it to install correctly. But it really is a remarkable device and it does what it sets out to do.",3.0,0

"Have had this belt for a year now. It is by far my favorite. The belt looks better as time passes but it is still passing for business casual with a nice pair of jeans and a dress shirt. Read a review that someone gave it back because the color was too light... that's a shame. They should have just waited. It will age and darken. You could apply any leather polish - for example the stuff for leather bicycle seats or baseball gloves - to darken it a shade instantly.
Give this one a shot. You won't regret it. I too grew tired of buying $20 junk Chinese made belts that looked good for about 5 days before starting to disintegrate.

"I am FAR from a jewelry expert by any stretch, and as a guy in particular, I freely admit I rarely notice earrings unless they are over-sized, or a womans hair is pulled up sufficiently so they can be noticed...however, I was quite impressed with the quality LOOK of these earrings. I gave them to my daughter for her birthday and she LOVES them (well, love may not be strong enough of a word here...).

They are platinum plated, sterling silver so they won't turn your skin green like the fake stuff usually does. They stay affixed like they ought to and more importantly, they LOOK like diamonds. A friend of mine is a precious metals independent worker who once told me that in all honesty, a GOOD CZ stone is virtually impossible to see with the naked eye, and many have a hard time seeing the difference even with help (I don't work in the industry, so I cannot verify that any of this is true--but I DO trust my friend, if that means anything). Long story short, these earrings LOOK good, they LOOK real and are the equal to 2 carats...which means they'll look dynamite on whoever wears them.

"If you aren't able to open the door for your dog all day - or can't get there fast enough while potty training - this is a really good solution for the price. The color matches my old aluminum door perfectly and it took my 4.5 month old puppy learned to use it in about 5 minutes. He really seems to love it. MOST IMPORTANT: unless you have a brand new sliding door and live in Southern California, plan on buying different weather stripping. I used expanding weather seal tape made by M-D (http://www.amazon.com/M-D-Building-Products-03100-Compressible/dp/B007NG6IJ6) on all the sides and top of the panel and it solved the gapping/draft issues (my aluminum sliding door is about 70 years old and it's not exactly still square). You could also use a less expensive foam weather seal tape, but I think this one seals/insulates much better in extreme temperatures. My puppy is tall (labradoodle) and about 35 pounds right now and I'm glad I got the extra large door because it will accommodate his growth and gives him extra height for jumping in while he's little and awkward. When you measure for the panel, the total height should include the recessed space of the track where the door fits. I measured wrong: the entryway height of my door is about 80 inches, but the height including the recessed track (where the door fits) is about 82 inches (which is not a standard size) so this didn't quite fit. To fill the gap between the upper surface of the recess and the top of the door, I used the M-D expanding weather seal tape and it worked great.",4.0,0

"I have had dogs for over 30 years and have used a wide variety of crates. I currently own the larger MidWest iCrate, a larger 'generic brand' crate, this size in 'generic brand', and an extra large all steel crate, along with many airline style travel crates.

When I recently acquired a new 4 pound puppy, the MidWest iCrate was my first choice in new crates to buy for him.  The 24 inch size is ideal for this size puppy and the 12 pound dog he will grow into.  The crate is NOT meant to be used for a puppy that is going to grow into a very big dog (such as a Golden Retriever or Labrador).  It is just not sturdy enough for a big, strong willed puppy.  In that case, get the crate the puppy will need as an adult and use the barrier the comes with it to divide it when the pup is little.

This crate is meant for a small dog, therefore a small puppy. And for that, it is perfect.  The double set of doors allows you to set it up in a variety of locations and still have access for the pup.  We currently have it set up lengthwise with the side door left open for easy access.  The puppy can come and go as he pleases to access his pee pads at night in the kitchen, and then return to his crate to sleep.  He LOVES his crate and willingly runs to it at night to lay down and sleep while we babygate him in the kitchen. When compared to the generic crate that I have, the MidWest crate is made from a higher gauge wire, it assembles together tighter, and it just seems sturdier overall. The plastic pan is a heavier weight and is holding up well.

I definitely plan on always using MidWest crates in the future.",5.0,0

"Isn't it nice when some works out exactly the way it is supposed to?  I picked up a pair of Sony bookshelf speakers at a thrift shop months ago and decided it was time to mount them.  But I wanted a mounting that was simple, cheap, and effective, took a chance on these satellite speaker mounts and found them to be perfect.

The mounts can fit both single screw speakers (like my Sony) and double screw speakers, they can also be set up to be longer (about 5"") or shorter (about 3"") and come with the screws and hardware to mount to the speaker and to the wall (including dry wall anchors)  The mounts also include the Allen wrench necessary to adjust the mounts and permit the speaker to be oriented just about in any direction or attitude.

With the help of my cordless screwdriver, I had both speakers mounted nicely on the wall in about 15 minutes.  (And that includes looking over the included instructions until I realized that one could actually ignore them.)  Now these aren't the most beautiful speaker mounts, and they are plastic so don't try and mount some huge 20-lb speaker.  But for mounting small satellite speakers just about anywhere, these will work just fine, and at about $10 the price is just right.",5.0,0

These have strong magnets and attach very easy to the fridge. My 2 year old got these for his birthday and we had fun talking about animals and he tried to name them all (though made some mistakes).

"I'm very disappointed in this drive, as even with large files I can't write faster than 80MB/sec on a USB 3.0 port. But I don't think it's the drive's fault, as it's capable of much faster speeds and other people get those speeds.

The issue with these very fast USB 3.0 drives is that their speed is very much affected by the chipset being used, and the chipset drives. I am using a 2yr-old ASUS motherboard and it uses the ASMedia USB 3.9 chipset. It's a highly regarded chipset but it came out after the NEC/Renasys (sp?) and drivers seem optimized for the latter.

The odd thing is that I bought a 32 GB SanDIsk Extreme (not the Pro version, as this is new) last year and it's blazingly fast on the same port on the same computer, so I would have expected this to be at least that fast.

One thing to mention: These are expensive drives and the 32 GB Extreme was and still is expensive. The competition 3.0 drives have dropped but not the SanDisk Extremes, which I think is fair as they are so much faster. (I have a couple of other brands USB 3.0 flash drives and they are laughably slow compared to the SanDisks.)  However, what stunned me about the Extreme series, given the price, was how incredibly cheaply made they are. They are made of the crummiest plastic you can imagine and I'm sure I could squeeze and shatter it pretty easily.

With this new Extreme Pro series, there's still some of that, and these are far more physically delicate drives than other brands (esp given the price) but they don't feel quite as delicate as the Extreme series.",4.0,0

"The Bottoms Up was difficult for us, probably because of the 65 pound weight of our dog. I imagine it would be much easier with a smaller dog. Holding that much weight with just one arm is tough, and we guessed that the straps weren't comfortable for the dog.  Having to put it on each time we took him out wasn't convenient either.
We switched to a harness that fits on the back somewhat like a girdle. We put it on in the morning and it stays on all day. All we have to do to go out is to snap handles on. And, since there's two handles we can share the load. I'm sure it's more comfortable for the dog since the weight is distributed over a large area, rather than the two straps on the Bottoms Up.",3.0,0

It appears to be made similar to a sun shade you'd put in your car windshield to keep the heat down, and I'd imagine the metal will bend out of shape sooner rather than later.  This observation was made on more than one review, but a few people have reported back saying it's going strong.  Bottom line is that even if it does bend out of shape, I can buy 10 more at the same price as one of the higher end kits... so this seems like the best investment.

"The Unique 2nd Birthday Latex Balloon 6-pack arrived very quickly from the seller in professional packaging.

The package included six 12-inch diameter latex balloons in various colors that were printed with ""Happy 2nd Birthday"".

The only challenge I have learned with purchasing balloons online is finding somewhere to get them inflated.  I was able to find a grocery store here in town to finally do it, but it was definitely more expensive than just purchasing from them or pretty much anywhere else.

These balloons were not expensive, it was the getting them inflated with helium that got costly.  I think it was like $1.60 per balloon.

Overall, the quality and appearance of the balloons was nice.  I would definitely recommend these balloons, but be forewarned that you may run into more expense than you anticipated with inflating them.  The inflating cost is not a problem with the balloons...just what you run into when trying to get them filled.",5.0,0

"When I was a little girl, I had a wolf ring that I adored bought in some tourist trap Estes Park, Colorado, Keystone, South Dakota, Jackson Hole, Wyoming, someplace like that which I honestly don't remember, but I loved that ring, even though it was a man's ring that only fit on my thumb.  Alas rings that a child can afford are not the best quality and the silver plating quickly wore off my thumb turned green and I could no longer wear it.  When I saw this ring from Moon Wings, a company I have had nothing but stellar experiences with, I knew that I had to have it, but upon reading the other reviews I realized that this ring is very big and clearly a man's ring I changed my size from a seven to a nine and decided it would work for either myself or my boyfriend. It is lovely. There are two things I think the future buyer should be aware of the wolf is not the cuddly sort, he looks to my eye angry and ready to kill, if you are a wolf lover who wants a gentle noble spirit animal, be aware.  Also if you wear this ring as a statement to the viewer of your hands rather than yourself, in other words facing outwards, the little stainless teeth have a real tendency to catch on things and if you wear it the other way to the observer it kind of looks like nothing much just a canine of some description.

"I've not played the adult version of Cashflow so can't make a comparison but this game does a good job of teaching a basic tenet from the Rich Dad series: amass sources of passive income!  I bought this to play with my six year old because he's very interested in money and investing.  I thought this might be a good introduction to some basic concepts - and I believe it is a good introduction.  The instructions are not great, good enough but not great.  The instructions describe that you become a winner when your passive income exceeds your expenses - but there isn't really a winner of the game.  Small nuance but each individual ""wins"" by having passive income exceed expenses but the instructions don't state the first one to get there wins.

Each player gets a ""financial statement"" as their game card.  During play, each player gains passive income sources and expenses.  The players keep track of their passive income vs expenses on the financial statement.  When your passive income exceeds expenses... you win!  The game does a good job of reinforcing this concept and also does a good job providing examples of passive income sources (rental property, owning a business, etc.).  It's at a pretty basic level so understandable for kids; even my six year old understands the game well enough to be able to formulate a strategy or predict what he needs on the next turn in order to win.

Would recommend as a basic concept teaching tool.  And it's a fun game, too!",5.0,0

"I love this product.  My dog and I go on an 45 minute walk every day.  The first and last 15 minutes I use a 5 foot leash for a controlled heel walk at the park.  Then in between I take her to the field with this long lead where she can run in a wide circle, play fetch and sniff around as long as it's within a 26 circumstance of me.  The leash allows me control if an unexpected person or animal comes into sight versus being off lead.  It helps me burn her energy more effectively then a regular short leash walk (since I'm not a runner). I've taught her directions such as left, right, stop, back, let's go, etc. so she still has to follow my lead. It's been very durable and has NOT jammed even when fully extended.  The retraction is great and allows for more freedom of movement without getting tangled around her compared to the old string leads.",5.0,0

"We were feeding this to our two puppies (Goldens) for the past 7 months. At first they seemed to like it okay and then all of the sudden the last bag of food they weren't interested in it at all. Matter of fact, as hungry as they were, they would leave their entire bowl of food, untouched all day long. Only at night would they eat a TINY tad, only enough to basically sustain life out of starvation. One of the puppies started looking thinner and mind you, these ""puppies"" are already between 60-65 pounds each so I know they had be hungry. I started doing my own research on the food to try to see if others were experiencing this behavior with their dogs also. While I hadn't been buying this food on Amazon, I was buying it at our local pet food store, I still feel compelled to let everyone know that consumer affairs has a lot of complaints about this food, with the same exact symptoms as a lot of people on Amazon have and the same as we had with our two puppies, refusing to eat and loose stools. I returned the last bag I had purchased from the pet food store today and replaced their food with ""Zignature"" limited ingredient dog food and let me tell you, these dogs tore it up!! As soon as I sat their bowls down they started gobbling their food up. No I am not an employee of Zignature or paid by the company, this is just my honest review. So if your dog's refusing to eat or only nibbling at their bowl of TOTW and have loose stool or diarrhea, you may want to think about changing foods. Look up the consumer complaints yourself.",1.0,0

These dolls have extremely small parts including hands and arms that have to be detached to undress/redress them.

Past that, I have nothing but praise for these highly detailed beauties!  I love the accessories they come with including highly detailed shoes, purses, jewelry, and clothing.

"This is my 4th Panasonic video player, (two DVD, two Blu-ray) and each seems to get a little better than the one it replaced.
I bought this particularly to get a high quality player that still had analog audio outputs, as there appears to be a trend by manufacturers to end support for them in favor of only an hdmi and/or digital audio connection.  I leaned toward this because of reviews, and since I have had Panasonic equipment for a while, and have been satisfied.
The DMP-BDT500 plays a few discs that were not readable by an older Panasonic DMP-BD60 that I bought when I first made a shift to blu-ray.  I think it was the last firmware update that caused a problem with some discs in my collection.
I have to ding it one star for the remote.  As many other buyers noted the touch pad is not all that great, but may get used to it with more use.  A traditional remote with a multi-function directional 9-key pad would have likely made more sense, but I've only used it a few times so far, and I have a few other panny remotes that I can use with this player to get around the touch pad remote.
I have this paired with a Panasonic TC-P60ST60 plasma, and can only say the picture is phenomenal.  I plan to upgrade my audio to an AVR or separates with 7.1 channel surround next, but analog audio out from the player to my old AIWA stereo worked great once I realized I had them connected to the wrong RCA connectors for the 2 channel audio to work properly.",4.0,0

"This is the second and LAST time I will purchase these for my pet. The pieces in the bag did not look appetizing to begin with. Looked like the pieces had a lot of dark areas, like they were all from next to boned. It also seemed greasy when breaking into smaller pieces. Tried to feed these to my pet 2 different times, thinking maybe the first time she had eaten them too fast or something, but she promptly threw up her stomach contents both time. This happened earlier with a couple of bags purchased about 6 to 9 mos ago. I don't know what the issue is with this brand, it is supposed to have only 1 ingredient, chicken, in it. well it must be the crappiest, cheapest, most disease ridden chicken they can find. I purchase the Life Essentials brand by Cat Man Doo all the time --although they are for cats and come in much smaller bag-- these have NEVER EVER made my pet sick. NEVER!

"This review is for the Ekouaer Womens Satin Robe Wedding Party Wear (Red, XL).

This nightgown is elegant, classic and feminine. I got the red color, the red was a little brighter than I expected but really very lovely. I also purchased the XL size. I am a size 12/14 and it does fit but its a little small. If you are a larger then a size 14 this will NOT completely tie closed. It does tie closed on me, but its open in at the bottom and doesnt completely wrap like its supposed to.

The fabric is a beautiful, soft red satin. This does need ironing so if you are traveling with it, pack a travel steamer. I think its because the fabric is so delicate. Despite the fabric being so satiny, this is NOT see through, so if you are wearing your bra and panties underneath you cant see them when its completely closed.

The lace detail is amazing, the neckline has THICK bandings of lace sewn down the front, the sleeves have lace trim and it goes up into the sleeve to give it some design flare. The lace is white or slightly off white, but it is VERY QUALITY lace and not unraveling, falling off or threatening to tear at any part. In fact, the craftsmanship and detail of this robe on a whole is VERY well made, this is something you would pay a lot of money for at the higher end retail stores. If you like delicate lingerie that is classy and makes you look good, try this robe out and you will enjoy it! 5/5 stars

"The cold damp fog tries to grab at my ankles as I make my way down the darkened alley where I stop at the doorway marked only by a flickering blue lamp. I knock softly three times; wait for two seconds and then twice again. The spy hole immediately opens and I can feel myself being visibly searched from my head to my toes. I see the eyes catch a glimpse of my Three Wolf Moon Tee shirt and then just the barest of a smile. Seconds later, I hear the sound of several dead bolts being released and I am welcomed into a vibrant room full of beautiful people. Led to my table by a beautifully tantalizing Oriental woman wearing a thigh high cut dress, I am immediately set upon by servants trying to catch a glimpse of my famously designed shirt. I cannot begin to believe my good fortune at just being admitted into the famous Che Le Torche Cabaret in Algiers. No questions asked, no cards required...Just service with a smile and almost a sense of reverence or perhaps I should say... awe. I am on my second straight tequila, when I sense the presence of someone standing at the edge of my table. A tall thin man in a while silk suit wearing a Panama hat wordlessly hands me a card with just one word on it.. ""Omar"". He asks if he might join me. I quickly judge this is a man to be reckoned with after noticing the long scar running from the edge of his mouth to his right ear.

""Why not? I reply.

Before the evening is finished I will have found not a friend, but a new business partner, who is destined to make me a very rich man.

If I could give this 0 stars I would. We have 2 cats and 2 litter pans making us have to change the litter once a week.

"Caveat, I love Dominion.  This is more Dominion, so I love it.  The new mechanics are fun, and give some good variability to the game. Debt is an interesting mechanic, but it ultimately is just a new and limited form of currency that only applies to 6 of the 29 kingdom cards and 1 each of the events and Landmark cards.  Otherwise it is unused throughout the entirety of Dominion except for those 8 cards (so far).

It was supposedly conceived as a sequel to Prosperity, but I have to say I would not have clued in on that without doing some reading.  There are more Victory cards sure, but the highest costing Kingdom card is 5 coins if you don't consider the few cards that cost 8 debt.  If you are the sequel to Prosperity, that introduced 5 coin Platinum treasure and 8 coin cost cards, well you see my confusion as to calling this a sequel.  It brings back the split upgrade feature of Adventures, but only on one item, the castles, which pretty much only provide victory points.  It offers 2 duration cards, SeaSide is still my favorite expansion so yay there.

Adventures was a far more extensive expansion, I understand it is bigger by design but this feels underwhelming after that one. This actually feels like an expansion to the Adventures expansion, as we get more events and the locations mechanic feels like an extension of the event mechanic.  If you love Dominion, have at, but this is probably down around Hinterlands territory for me in the order of acquisition, ie one of the last expansions someone building a dominion set should worry about buying.",4.0,0

"This pelican is bright, cheery, and the perfect ""huggable"" size for my 1 year old.  The small animals/food for the pelican is equally bright, and each one has a different tactile response.  The purpose of the toy is for the baby to ""feed"" the small animals to the pelican.  The child has to really push the animals in, because the toys tend to get stuck in the pelican's throat, but I chalk that up to helping develop fine motor skills.  The only issue I have with this toy is that the opening in the belly is large enough that the little animals will just fall out on their own.  In fact, while my 2 year old twins enjoy playing with the pelican the ""right"" way, my just turned 1 year old prefers to stuff the little animals straight into the pelican's belly.  There is also ties on the top of the bird to allow it to be tied to crib rails or a play yard - at least according to the directions.  Personally, I would not tie the toy to the rails of a crib, because by the time a child reaches the designated age to play with this toy (9months - 3years) anything tied to the crib could be potentially be used as a step.  However, we keep it in the toy box, and it gets played with off and on all day long. Overall I'm very pleased with this toy.",4.0,0

"These screen protectors definitely do their job, as do most; however, I just can't seem to justify these for my Kindle Touch. (Especially in consideration of a few outstanding faults)

The most annoying aspect of this particular product was that it was not a very precise fit whatsoever. The Kindle Touch uses a good deal of perimeter screen area for display, which makes having nearly one centimeter clearance on each side of a centered screen protector application extremely annoying and difficult to overlook. If they were perfectly clear, it may be a little easier for others to overlook, but the translucence is ever so slightly different than the screen itself. I removed my screen protector immediately after application.

I must note that I often and gladly employ the use of screen protectors whenever reasonably applicable, particularly with touch screen cell phones, but when it comes to the Kindle Touch I'm not too sure if they truly serve any degree of necessary function at all. With most book-like e-reader covers (mine being the standard ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Amazon-Kindle-Touch-Leather-Cover-Black/dp/B004SD22PQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Amazon Kindle Touch Leather Cover, Black</a>"" - of which I am EXTREMELY happy with), the only time the screen is actually exposed would be when the Kindle is in use. In this case, the annoyance of a poorly fitting screen protector doesn't come close to outweighing the slim risk of anything happening to the screen in conjunction with a proper cover and/or case.

In summation: If you find that you need a screen protector and don't mind that it only covers 95% of the screen, then this product should certainly suffice - 3 stars for the sake of advertised purpose fulfillment.",3.0,0

I purchased a second Sherwood RX-4109 for about $90 with tax from electronics expo a couple of months ago.  I notice a very quiet hum from the speakers when the receiver is powered up and no signal is sent.  Once I press play on the CD player the hum disappears and can only be heard at extreme low volume.

Got this for Christmas last year. Had 2 6.5s and a bridged 12 hooked up. Ran 0 gauge from battery and ground and 12g to speakers. Worked well for about 6 months. Around July or August it started having issues channels failing in an odd way. Any amp Ive had in the past that has gone bad the channel stayed dead. It developed a whine in one speaker and then channels would randomly cut out until you turned it off for a few minutes and back on again. This would cut out in one channel one day and another on a different day. Rechecked wiring and all is good. Distortion is bad at higher volumes and bass is very muffled.

"I really wish this fountain worked out. I love the concept of the water dish being separated from the food dish. It minimizes food crumbs in the water and one fountain can be used for the whole herd of pets.

This little thing was terrible. First, it leaked. I was unable, for a while, to find the source of the leak or fix it. It soaked through several towels and left a water stain on my beautiful hardwood floors.  I found a few online forums that had the same issue. I checked to make sure it was level, there were no holes, and it wasn't over full.  Well it filled up right to the brim, but it was leaking from the flimsy reserve add on tank. I ended up removing it but it was still leaking a little.

Maybe a day after the leaking issue was temporarily fixed, it just stopped working. It was plugged up, the very faint buzz from the adapter was there, but the water refused to flow.  I'm in the process of returning this now. Definitely am expensive waste.",1.0,0

I JUST ORDERED 2 NEW CASES, so if they are like the last batch. They are going back to Amazon because of crap quality control.

I gave this product 5 stars earlier, however, their last product sucked!!!

To sum it up... Great ingredients, and great for your cats. But how about not making it gooey stinking goop?

You need better quality control. My cats are about to give up on this food because it comes out as goo. I've even put it in the refrigerator, and it's still the same goop.

"Super cute, made well, fits great!

My daughter is 15 months old, 25 pounds and has chubby thighs.
I read many of the reviews saying that this item runs a bit large.  I purchased two sizes since Amazon offers free returns on this item, thinking I would try them on and keep one.

My daughter currently wears 18-24 month clothing.

I purchased two sizes: 18 months and the 2T.

The 18 month size fits her perfectly.  It's not too tight, there is room to grow in both the top and bottom.
The top is cut nice and long, so the bottom of the top sits at on her lower hips.  On my daughter, the hem of the top covers the waist of the bottoms, this helps the top from riding up.
The bottoms fit nicely over swim diapers.

We have used this both at the pool and the spray ground (I have included photos, front and back).
The quality (we have had these for one week) look to be great, the zipper is sturdy and very easy to zip up and down.  I do love how easy it is to get on and off.  One other reviewer did not like the bulk of the zipper, and I can see if the the child is wearing a size that is too large, then the top might ride up and the zipper might be bulky, but we don't have this problem.

I returned the size 2T, which also could have worked nicely, they were not too big and she may have grown into them, but I liked the fit of the 18 month suit a little better.",5.0,0

"I ordered two of these dresses--- in black and blue chevron stripes. I have yet to see the blue one, so I cannot comment on it. The black one, though, is great. It is made of a slinky polyester material that stretches a bit. It does fit slightly large (I ordered a small), and I wonder if the length is meant to be shorter. I am about 5 ft 4 in, and it goes to the bottom of my knees. I am a 34C/D bra size, and there is plenty of room in the chest. So far, I've worn it with knee high black boots, and it makes a cute outfit. As far as what others think, from the moment I put it on, I received compliments from multiple complete strangers saying, ""I'm sorry, but I just have to tell you I LOVE your dress!""  Of course, that kind of reaction is always a plus. I have worn this three times already. It is very comfortable. It has been well-received both in the casual and professional executive work environments. I hope the blue one is just as nice. I do recommend this particular print and style of dress (wrap dress with chevron stripes).",5.0,0
"I'm a 36B, which means that I don't need any heavy-duty compression with exercise (I'm a light jogger), and this bra is labeled as a ""medium support bra,"" which I was fine with--I was just hoping to avoid the typical sports bra uni-boob. I'd read the negative reviews from others who brought this bra, in which they noted that the bra didn't provide enough support--which made sense to me, once I saw the fabric in the bra cups, which consists of a fine and breathable mesh material...and my guess is that it wouldn't do such a great job of keeping your nipples from showing through a t-shirt.

Anyway, I do think the bra is well-made, and this company is known for it's quality products, but here's my major complaint and advice to you regarding this bra: if you're a size C cup or smaller, don't bother (or those with C cups should consider the B cup), because the 36B bra that I purchased had huge, loose, silly cups...I put the thing on, and I started laughing at myself in the mirror. It was obvious that, in order for me to fill the bra cups, I needed to almost triple my cup size. Seriously. It was hilarious. I'd say that the only people who would benefit from this bra are those busty ladies looking for a basic, mildly supportive sports bra for the type of exercise that yields little-to-no boob bouncing--like on an elliptical machine, or slow-paced walking. Or perhaps for those busty ladies who don't exercise at all, but just need a bit of lifting and separating...

I'm open to suggestions from anyone who actually wears a 36B (nothing bigger--there are plenty of bra reviews out there from those with larger cup sizes that I can refer to) and can advise on a sports bra that's less than $50, does not lead to uni-boob, and actually provides at least medium support. I also think it would be great if Amazon came up with an option to search and read bra reviews based on your actual size...",2.0,0

"The Buttkicker adds a bit of shake to your home theatre.  It doesn't replace the subwoofer, but sort-of turns the floor into a lower subwoofer.  And I love it.  But there are some things you should know.

First, the LFE Kit (with Amp) is probably the best choice to start with because you can't drive it from your receiver - not enough power.  So getting in the game will cost you around $500. Which is more than for Aura Bass Shakers, but far better.

Second, one LFE Kit will do a sofa nicely, but if you, like me, mount it under your floor, you're gonna need two.  Possibly more, but probably two.  Because that's a LOT more mass to shake, and otherwise they'll be maxxing out and making a loud knocking noise.

Third, it's not like riding a rollercoaster.  You'll feel the floor shake from loud sound effects, bombs, etc., but don't expect magic.  It makes the movie more real, but it doesn't toss you around.

"Overall, I really love this item. My 10 month old loves it too. The best feature is of course the canopy. We wouldn't get to stay in the pool for as long as we do without the canopy. The sun can be so damaging, even with sunscreen on, so this allows me to not worry so much about that. The baby is 100% shaded when in this floaty, which is very important to me. We can stay in the pool for as long as we want and not worry about his sensitive skin getting burned. He sits comfortably in the mesh part where his legs go thru, and sometimes even leans backward in it like he's laying in a hammock! haha Personally, we don't use the blow-up octopus part on the front. We tried it at first but soon realized he had trouble seeing around it because he's still so small. So we replaced that. We chose to attach the toys to the sides where the canopy snaps on/off. He really loves the squeaky fish! The only other drawback is that when he's in the floaty, he can't actually reach the water with his hands to splash. He sits in the water but other than that, he can't reach it. So that is a bit of a bummer. But overall, we really love it and would recommended it. It is so cute too!",5.0,0

"Boss Monster is a light card game for 2-4 players, that takes about 30 minutes (give or take depending on experience and number of players).

In this game, each player takes control of a boss from an 8-bit video game RPG. You must build a fiendish and deadly dungeon, and lure heroes into it with the kind of loot that they like, in order to brutally murder them. You use Room cards to build the dungeon, and Spell cards to aid you (or hinder your opponents). If your dungeon is strong enough, you will kill the heroes and collect them as ""souls"" (points). If the dungeon is too weak, the heroes will break through and wound you. Any boss who takes five wounds is killed and out of the game. But the first boss to survive and gain ten souls is the winner.

This is a solid, fast-paced card game. The theme is fantastic and I love the look of the cards. In fact, everything about the game just screams ""fun"" at first glance, right down to the parody art of famous video games and other pop culture figures. In fact, why the game succeeds is because the theme is tied so strongly to the mechanics, and they blend well, even though it's a very simple game.

It does have some faults. The rulebook could use some work and does not clarify certain basic rules. There's also something of a runaway leader problem (in our game of four, two of us were WAY ahead of the pack by an early point of the game). It's also a game that is already starved for expansions...replay value is questionable.

However, the game itself is very enjoyable for now, and I plan on playing it much more. Kudos to the Brothers for their successful Kickstarter, which amounted to a fine game.",4.0,0

"This thing is awesome! I've used the soundfreaq soundkick for work for a couple of years and occasionally I bust it out at home but it's better suited for beating out ambient noise (for audibility's sake)  than it is for casual home listening. I wanted more, and I got it. The fluance  isn't really a good buy for portability, in my opinion. This is for a technology affluent sort who wants good sound they can tie to their smart phone. The unit is surprisingly heavy, which ends up being a good thing. Bass is substantial without being muddy, which I deeply appreciated after too much time spent with bose and Sony units at friends houses. It's sound has a difficult to place warmth that I imagine comes from the heavy wood enclosure. Highs are clear without being tinny, and mids are presented well. I personally believe that if mid range presentation is something you are deeply concerned with, single unit Bluetooth speakers will consistently disappoint you.  Get something more akin to a stereo. With all of that said, I strongly suspect you will enjoy the sound of this unit. I've thrown everything at this thing, and it consistently sounds amazing. I've played techno, heavy metal, jazz, bossa nova, acoustic players like Andy McKee, and more others than I care to mention and it adds listening value to all of them. I don't want to understate this. Koop, the dillinger escape plan, aphex twin, jars of clay and Eric clapton all sounded awesome. That's a tonal diversity I'm not accustomed to with anything other than my sennheiser headphones that cost considerably more.
I would shop around a little more if portability is a major selling point for you, but on all other points I urge you to get this unit. It is a delightful tonal surprise at this price and I'm thrilled with my purchase.",5.0,0

From a dog psychology standpoint, I found that even after using it for a year, Toby still wanted to leap off the ramp when he got halfway down.  And his legs were not able to handle that, so I had to lead him down the ramp by holding his collar so he wouldn't try to jump off.  In the end, it was prostate cancer that did him in.  The Petstep is now stored in the garage and I'm sure we'll be using it again as soon as Lucy gets too old to jump in and out of the SUV on her own.  But she's only 6 so she has a few more good years I think.",5.0,0
A little smaller than my vintage 13 inch simply because this screen is wide and my old one was longer from top to bottom. But it serves the purpose quite nicely for the kitchen. I use it with my blu-ray dvd player and it is awesome. The sound is tinny even though I use external speakers. Don't know if a better pair of speakers would raise this rating but for the price of the TV I son't know if it would be worth the investment. I like it very much.,5.0,0

"Beautiful earrings! These were delivered to me by my mailman during the middle of my annual memorial day party. Everyone kept asking what did you get??? What was in the box from Amazon. I planned to open it later, but my nosy family insisted on seeing what I had. So, I finally opened my package. I had 3 items in there from Amazon, one of which was a pretty little black box. I opened it knowing it would be these earrings. As soon as I took them out of the box everyone oooed and ahhhhhh'd. Then they all said they look really expensive. My mother had recently celebrated her 75th birthday, which is in May. She grabbed them out of my hands and said she loved them and that this was her birthstone, so she would like to have them. She told me she would give me a check for them once she got home. My mother is a simple lady and not materialistic at all, so the fact that she was so taken by these speaks volumes for the quality. She then put them in her ears and proudly wore them home. I told her that since she loved them so much I wanted her to keep them as another gift for her special birthday.
These are gorgeous, well made and they did come with the different backings. One is called a butterfly backing, and not sure what the other is called. Anyway, I guess I will be ordered another set and will not be opening in front of anyone, lol.
I and the rest of my family would recommend them. They are small, but impressive. It is true what they say that good things come in small packages.

"I am so impressed with this Micro SD Adaptor.  Not only it fits in my Dell XPS15, 9560, but it is very well made.  It is much more expansive than other micro SD adapters.  The card is little bit shorter (about 0.5mm) than the depth of the SD card slot (see attached photo) because it is not made for the XPS15, 9560, but it is not a problem.  There is no problem removing it from the laptop with you finger nail.  The manufacturer is not planning to make a custom fitting card adapter for the new Dell XPS15, 956-0, so you have to settle for this adapter if you are looking for flush fitting Micro SD Adapter.  When buying this adapter, make sure to get the right model (103A).  The other models made by BaseQi are either too short or too long or do not fit at all.
Prior to buying this, I bought a very inexpensive plastic adapter, and it destroyed the SD card slot's internal card contacts on the first try.  I had to replace the laptop motherboard to correct the damaged card slot.  Yes, the card reader slot is embedded on the motherboard, so there was no other solution but replacing the entire motherboard.  Yes, it was an over $1,000.00 mistake.  You get what you pay for.

I happened to find some by accident, and it took all of about 2 hours to break them in and for them to mold perfectly to my foot. Cushe shoes are the ultimate comfort and support. My feet never tire in them. I used to wear different brands all of the time, but I don't see any need to shop around for comfort since I found Cushe. There are enough styles to cover many looks. If you have not tried them and want a super comfortable shoe, obviously since I have 10 pair I'm sold on them.
Only reason for 4 stars. The shoes I received do NOT have the type of laces shown, which was a major factor in deciding to buy this shoe. I have another pair in a different color that does have the shown lace, and I like them much better. I'm a bit disappointed because the laces shown look better and you don't have to mess with tying them. I will probably write the seller and ask if they can send me the laces shown.

"My youngest daughter, my niece and their friends are all into Monster High dolls, so this was a very welcome addition to the collection.  The playset is huge!  Even though the box was somewhat large, I was still surprised by the size of the finished product.  Speaking of which, it requires some relatively minor assembly.  Once assembled, it can either be used as a play toy or a large themed display case for over a dozen dolls for the types who are more into collecting the dolls rather than playing with them.  My oldest daughter collected Bratz years ago and still has them preserved in their fancy custom themed storage cases to this day.  She rarely actually played with them.  On the other hand, my youngest daughter and my niece are more into playing with their dolls than collecting, so this playset sees a lot of action.  It can also be used for both purposes.  It's durable enough to withstand hours of regular play and the dolls can be stored inside on decorative display when not in use.  The playhouse is somewhat sturdy but can be a little shaky at times and has several moveable parts, some of which seem like they may be easily broken if your child is a little too rough.  Speaking of dolls, none are included with the playset.  I ordered two new dolls so I could present them along with the playset.  It just seemed more exciting to surprise her with the playset along with new dolls instead of just the playset alone.  The girls absolutely love it so far.  It's definitely a worthwhile pickup if you have a young girl who plays with or collects Monster High dolls.  Just make sure there is plenty of room for storage and play, because  like I said...

"I started looking for climbing toys for our now 17mth old before Christmas & after hours online, this was my fav. I planned to buy it for our daughters big Santa gift but hesitated after reading some reviews about poor safety features...when the priced dropped after Christmas, I'd still not found anything I liked better so I decided to give it a shot. I am SO glad I ignored the few negative reviews. It is absolutely perfect for our energetic, climbing toddler. She is able to climb the wall with no trouble, the slide is fast & long enough for her to enjoy, she can get a ball into the basketball hoop herself & while the potential is there with most any toy for a child to use it incorrectly and possibly get hurt, under minimal supervision, I see no imminent risk in this toy. (the concerns I read were toddlers ""diving"" through the hole for footballs to be thrown through). That particular opening in question does not hit our child in a place height wise where that is an issue. If she's standing, the hole is around her belly, if she sits, she can peek through the hole, but with the majority of her body safely on the platform, she isn't likely to fall from it. A child, if intentionally trying to dive through, coud get it through it I guess but it doesnt seem very probable. Again, I'm glad I bypassed that info and ordered anyway. I was also glad it was not quite as huge as I'd envisioned, it will be easy to move outside in warmer weather. It was also easy to put together which is a major plus! As a child development professional, I'd also recommend this for building gross motor skills. Definitely recommend this toy, we are so pleased with it...most importantly, so is our child!

"I bought this for my dog  and he likes it very much, which says a lot because he is usually a picky dog. This food actually looks similar to corned beef, minus the white colored fat, this just has a spoonful of congealed juices at the bottom of the can. I did think it would have more gravy in it given its sold as a gravy cravers dog food but that's alright, I can add just a little warm water for gravy. Its mostly a smooth pate of food, except the Filet Mignon, that has slight chunks along with the pate. This doesn't smell nasty, it actually does smell quite good. Similar to canned beef stew. All and all, this is a very good canned food for the price. Its also nice that I can have it shipped to my home with prime. Another thing, I wanted to mention, I've seen the reviews others have left saying their dog had gastrointestinal upsets, mine did not, I think it does vary from dog to dog, but I've not had any issues.

"To preface, I have a one year old pit bull mix who chews through EVERYTHING. The only toy she has yet to destroy is her black kong, of which she doesn't actually chew on too much. That being said, this seemed like a pretty sturdy toy so I got it since she loves squeak toys and I was looking for something that would actually hold treats and make her work for them. It took about three weeks for her to chew off one of the legs, at which point the toy was still functional, and was actually longer than I was expecting that particular leg to last as she started chewing on it the day she got it. A week later the belly started to tear at one end of the insert, but again, was still functional. A week after that, she chewed through the middle of the body leaving all but the squeaky head (of which she isn't particularly interested in due to the force it takes to make it squeak) no longer functional. Overall, it lasted around 5 weeks, which while I obviously wish it had lasted longer, I'm still generally pleased with the length of time it lasted considering the amount it was played with (a lot but not a TON). I'm considering getting another one but haven't yet decided. I wish they'd make something similar but without legs.

SUMMARY:

PROS:
-Holds up pretty well with major chewers, and probably indestructible for other dogs
-Multi functional as chew toy and very interactive treat dispenser (as well as floats and what not)
-kept my dog occupied when filled with treats or kibble (kibble worked best actually)
-cute
-squeaker isn't too loud

CONS:
-not indestructible for big chewers
-the stupid legs (They're it's weakest point)
-the amount of pressure needed to squeak the head made my dog disinterested in its squeaking ability (but was interested for food purposes)
-Price (which would be totally reasonable to me if it lasted for more than 5 weeks)",4.0,0

"This kit is great for the money. I have this and have used it many times for my various cameras. I do not have any problems with most of it.

"My husband and daughter put this Titanfall building set together and it turned out impressive looking. Our Atlas Titan man is able to stand (fairly large dude) and we are able to do simple poses with him. This model really does look cool when it's all together. Kids age 8 or 9 should be able to put this together, especially if they have had some experience with K'NEX building kits and/or have some help with assembling them. We've had other kits in the past and have enjoyed working on them together. Older kids shouldn't have a problem with the Atlas building set.

The downside of this set is that with some of the parts, they were difficult for my daughter to snap together and she is usually pretty good at that and has snapped together parts that I was unable to fit together in the past with other model sets. This was a little frustrating for her. The model does have some cool features like the little man inside and the usable weapon that I was shot with a number of times, but isn't strong enough to put out an eye.

All in all, this a cool kit that does require patience and a little strength-younger kids will greatly benefit from and really enjoy some help with assemblage. We have our Titan Man standing proudly on the kitchen table and have put him in a few different poses. The feet have to be planted evenly for him to stand and the surface he is on has to be totally even. This was a good rainy day family project and took a few hours to fully complete.",4.0,0

"I don't prefer any of the stand-alone variations to the original Carcassonne and its expansions, but Gold Rush is definitely my favorite of them.

Compared with the original:
-Railroads score similarly to roads (score double if only one tile has a locomotive)
-Farmers score based on native villages (2 points each) and horse riders (4 points each) in the field
-Mountains score the number of gold nuggets showing on the tiles
-A City tile scores 3 points for each complete connected railway
-At game's end, acquired mining tokens are revealed, gold is tallied and added to the final score

Gold Rush is challenging in a couple of ways. You only get 4 meeples, so throwing out that farmer too early will limit your options more than in the original game.  Placing one on a city tile is also risky, because you don't get it back until all connecting railroads are completed.  Also, other players can place a tent into a mountain your worker is attempting to mine, and they can mine it too (with some limitations). When you score the mountain you get all unclaimed tokens, but unless you did it quickly, there might not be any left to claim.

I don't much like the surprise victory points from the mining tokens at the end. It would be more strategic to know the value of what you have acquired as the game progresses, but that's a minor thing.  I really like the economy of decisions, in which you can choose not to place a worker, and instead take a mining token from a mountain you have claimed, or move your tent to a different tile within a mountain that contains more mining tokens.  The direct competition for mining tokens is a nice change of pace for me, but others might not like this aspect.  Overall, I think there's a slightly elevated tension in this variation of what is usually a pretty casual game, and I really enjoy it.",4.0,0

"They are very pretty, but in every angle, the boot appears to have an upper section that is a lighter shade of tan than the foot of the boot -- it's the *exact* same tan throughout. Also, I was looking for a dark turquoise and instead I got green. Now, I have exceptional eyesight, so I assure you it's not me. My phone is less than a year old -- from which I ordered the boots and damn near everything else I buy -- so it's not my technology, either.
Just be warned that the Rio Grande isn't quite as it appears on your screen.
It's also just a little snug in the width. I bought a nine when I normally where an 8.5, knowing I'll be standing in them a while, and my feet will swell a bit. A nine with no socks still is a touch snug at the widest part of my foot (no, I don't wear WW shoes).",4.0,0
"I have three dogs, and I am constantly hiking. But I also have pronation and require orthotics and a good, sturdy boot to hike without spraining my ankle every other step.

I have two pairs of Merrell Women's Moab Mid Waterproof Hiking Boots, and I still wear both of them. The first pair, I ordered a year ago, and though I'm out in them every day, the tread still looks brand new.

They are very reliable, even out in the rain. My first pair only lost it's ""waterproof"" viability when I had to walk in two feet of water on a hike. And I'm sure they probably could be sprayed with waterproofing spray to get them back into shape; I just haven't done it yet. If you know you're going to be out in a constant torrential downpour, rain boots are more appropriate, but these should keep you dry unless you're walking in water.

I mentioned that I have pronation, and this can make me very prone to spraining my ankle. These boots have a good mid-height that keep my ankles secure, but they're not so stiff that they cause chafing. You'll find when you first get them that they're only a little stiff, and one or two walks will probably be enough to break them in.

Both my pairs are a half-size larger, and I did this based on other reviews. I highly recommend this as well, as I find that if I'm wearing bulky socks, they can rub a little on my outer toes even at a half-size larger.

They're very comfortable. Not exactly walking on clouds, but your feet are definitely are not going to hurt after five or six hours on the trails. I wear Doc Martens to work (office work, but I'll never wear heels), and when I slip the Merrells on, they do feel like slippers.

I have worn several other waterproof day-type boots (leading brands), and I lost treads and the boots fell apart quickly. These are definitely for the long haul and worth every penny.",5.0,0

"I like that this doesn't have corn syrup and petroleum jelly in it. I had been using the regular Laxatone and Lax'aire products, but not for hairballs for softer stools. My kitten, now a year old, has had an ongoing issue with extremely dry stools even though he eats 1/2 wet 1/2 dry diet (wish it were all wet food) and apparently doesn't drink enough water. Anyhow, he loved the taste of the other two as I'd just put some on his food dish and he'd lick it up so there was a concern he wouldn't like the natural version. Thankfully he loves this just as much crying for it as soon as he sees me reach for the tube.

As for effectiveness, neither of the other two seemed to help soften much although I feared giving him too much as I didn't want him to become dependent upon it for bowel movements.  It does make me feel better giving him the natural version. We'll see if it helps soften his stool as thus far even giving him about two half inch servings a day hasn't seemed to help :-( And, I really hope none of the ingredients are bad for kitties...

Update as of July 5, 2014: This product HAS really made a difference and my kitten is no longer in distress or crying when it's time for a bowel movement. It's comforting to know this natural product has made all the difference versus the original product. I give him about 1 inch twice a day. He continues to lick it up as I just put it on his bowl.

"I'm discriminating. Willing to pay for better/best quality. However, I planned to use this for a Disney Trip (2 adults, 2 kids) and I wanted a carry on as a back pack (to free my hands for car seats), then a smaller back pack for the park (instead of just a wheeled backpack only which would have been much bigger in the park than I wanted). This was fantastic. No problems on domestic flight with wheeled part (with day pack zipped off). Fit no problem straight in. Squishing straps great. I did NOT have much trouble with the pull arm as some reviewers, slight sticking at times but better than most of my luggage (NOT as good as my Victorinox for a comparison, but still very good). Zippers heavy duty and work well. Day pack holds much more than I expected, more like a true backpack (I had expected a little larger than a fanny pack. This is MUCH larger than that.). Water bottle slots hold CamelBak style bottles fine. Little compartment at top for earphones, charger, inhaler, medicines and front compartment held sunglasses, wipes, sunblock stick, snacks, etc. Main compartment had two rain jackets, two sweaters, magazines, sandwiches, snacks, baseball caps. My wife didn't really have to carry anything in the park. Even with all that, it slid right under the seat no problem, with room for my feet still. Some noted trouble zipping the day pack onto the main pack when full. I didn't bother as it has a nice ""hold a bag"" strap (like the Victorinox) that worked great, so didn't bother zipping on. If both full of hard objects, I could see some trouble, but if relatively flat, should zip on no problem. However, look around!! I found for just under $100 elsewhere. For that it was a steal. For the $175-200 range, I still think it is worth it (now that I have it). Bite the bullet, you are really getting two really good bags for one.",5.0,0

"I've been very pleased with these leggings. I'm 5'11"" and usually a L/XL size that says it will fit me, does not.  I was very impressed that these DID fit. They ended about 3 inches above my ankles, but could be pulled lower, resulting in a thinner, stretched legging.
 I was also impressed with how versatile the sizing can be for these because of the elastic waistband and stretchy fleece. These are true to the claim that they do not contain a seam.  The inside is a very soft, low pile fleece material. The outside is smoother, not furry.  The elastic waistband is incorporated INTO the fabric, so the waist is VERY comfortable and not bulky at all. These keep my legs warm in the winter and pair nicely with a boot.
I have noticed that when something rubs against them in the same place over and over, they can get little fuzz balls. They also attract animal hair like crazy.

"Majority Rules Card Game by Flat River Group is an interesting party game on an original premise. The rule is pretty simple. Players pick five candidates, real or fictional, at the start of the game. The chairperson then picks a question card from the pile and reads it out. Players vote for the candidate to whom they think the question is most applicable. The majority wins. All players start with 10 points each and would bet 1-3 points based on how confident that they would win the round. Most of the questions are edgy and ludicrous. How fun the game would be largely depends on the initial selection of the five candidates and how the players would go all out on a debate and defend their votes. If you have a good mix of candidates and a group of imaginative and outspoken players, the game is gonna be fun and awesome. If not, you will very soon find the group ready to move on.

Although this may be a fun and ludicrous party game, some of the questions presented tend to be adult only (sex related). As such, I'm seriously doubt that the age 14 and up rating from the manufacturer is appropriate. I would personally remove those questions before passing it to my teenager when he has his friends over. The game comes with everything you'll need such as a dry erase board and pen for writing the five candidates down, 1-2 point chips for betting and spinners for selecting your own vote.",4.0,0

"I had considered one of these kinds of cat litter boxes for a long time but always figured my cats would probably not use it, especially after seeing it go through a sweeping cycle. I was very surprised how easily they took to it and immediately seemed to prefer it over their regular litter boxes. My only real criticism of the box is that it instructs you to use very little litter and it often times is not enough for the cat to cover and the rake leaves what little there is at the end of the box. I do think it will be a real help when we have to leave the cats unattended for a log period of time. The motor operates very quietly and it was easy to assemble.  I have two cats and since you are supposed to have 1 more litter box than cats I can see where having to buy 3 of these would get pretty expensive. However, price aside, I would recommend this for anyone wanting to cut back on a nasty job.
 1 month follow-up:
  This is a neat concept but there are such wide spaces on the rake that it leaves a lot of little pieces behind and the maximum recommended level of cat litter is hardly enough for the cat to cover it up. I also think the 15 minute delay is not long enough for it to dry up and become scoopable. After using it for nearly a month I withdraw my recommendation. The con's outweigh the pro's.",3.0,0

"I was very disappointed to find that there is NO Vimeo app available, as it has been for previous models.

I am hoping this is just a temporary issue since this model just hit the market.

Unfortunately the answers from Sony are pretty much ""...thanks for asking, no details,...wait and see...""

Therefore, I would not recommend this player if you need Vimeo.

*** three month update ***
Still no Vimeo! No response from Sony support or user sites. Not good.

With moderate use, we have found that it does not crash as frequently as the previous year's model. So we don't have to pull the plug quite as often. Yes, there is no other re-boot or recovery option other than pulling the plug. Not good.

Rating now downgraded to two stars.

My advice: forget Blu-Ray, get Roku, absolutely top-notch engineering and solid software. Streaming support is blazing fast, no startup lag, quality just as good as the Sony.

"Quite beautiful! I was very happy to receive this as a gift from my husband (who is terrible at picking out jewelry. this was on the short list that I sent him so he could ""surprise"" me in pre-approved fashion. ) :)) Of course it's lightweight, as some reviewers have noted--a completely solid (filled) 14k gold bracelet would cost a fortune!!!! Most gold jewelry these days is hollow, to reduce cost. For me this is great, because I can't stand heavy jewelry, so this is just like my other Duragold bangles. very light and very comfortable to wear all day long. I've had it for about 3 months now, maybe 4, I wear it almost every day with other jewelry, and see no dents or dings (people who complain about 14k jewelry sustaining dents might want to remember that all 14k jewelry is somewhat soft and prone to dents with heavy or careless use). Additionally, the etching is doing a great job of hiding any scratches it might have sustained. So if you ""play rough"" or regularly tend to, for example, run into walls (??) gold jewelry might not be ideal for you. If you play nice, this is a great bangle, looks very sparkly with the diamond etching, and has a lovely sturdy clasp and a great shape. You won't want to take it off. If you have questions about size, a sizing chart is provided above, and it's very easy to convert millimeters into inches using the Internet. or a ruler. or math. :) 10 mm equals 1 cm. 2. 5 cm equals 1 inch.

"Twyla looks quite different than pictured.  In person, my overall impression of Twyla is that she is less cutesy and has more of an intense/forlorn presentation that is appropriate for a monster like her:  The Daughter of the Boogey Man.  Twyla is all moonlight and shadows - her main colorways are a waxy mint green and her favorite color burple (which according to her is blue mixed with purple).  Twyla's skin is a very light purple which gradually changes to smoky gray on her forearms and hands.  She has silvery smoke patterns that start at her ankles and reach up her calves.  Twyla has purply-pink eyes, frosty pink lips and cute little dimples at the edge of her mouth.  I love her bright mint green eyebrows and her long soft minty green hair with  burple streaks.  As others have mentioned, a fun thing about Twyla is that the whites of her eyes glow in the dark!  (I thought her hair might glow as well, but sadly, no.)

Twyla is a new character - she is 15, shy, and hides under ""normie"" kid's beds to catch bad dreams.  She has the best Monster High Pet yet:  a purple dust bunny named Dustin.  Twyla is one of the smaller scale MH dolls - the same size as Howleen Wolf.  She wears a blue and black elbow length blouse and a tiered black and mint mini skirt with purple net ruffles.  Her accessories are a mint green belt and bracelet, a purple and black handbag with a cobweb and purple and black heels.  Her best accessories are her silver earrings that are a silver Victorian style door knob and lock-set.  She comes with a doll stand, hair brush and diary.

I know a lot of collectors are excited about Twyla and the new 13 Wishes Doll line.  Twyla is a great original new character.  Monster High does not disappoint.",5.0,0

"I'd consider myself an advanced non-professional photographer...which means I have a DSLR with two lenses (a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Canon-EOS-Rebel-T3/dp/B004J3Y9U6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Canon EOS Rebel T3</a>), an external flash, and a random assortment of other camera items (an old Canon point-and-shoot, a waterproof point-and-shoot, an HD video camera, the assorted SD cards, lens covers, etc.). I currently have the el cheapo Canon bag that came with my Rebel and I barely use it, so hoped that by getting a REAL camera bag, I'd be more apt to consolidate everything into one bag and carry it with me. Unfortunately, it hasn't been the case. I blame the fact that I'm generally already carrying a diaper bag with me, LOL.

PROS:

The bag is definitely WELL MADE. The fabric is thick and the stitching is heavy-duty. The velcro isn't sewn on cheaply so that it will start pulling off after a handful of uses. Comparing it to my Canon bag is like night and day. Everything on the Canon bag feels cheap while everything on the Lowepro feels luxurious.

The bag is very adaptable and adjustable. The insides are full velcro panels so that you can rearrange the inserts in any which way you need and there are lots of pockets. I like that the cover panel folds over onto itself so that the top becomes very easily accessible (being covered without actually being latched shut in any way).

There is no logo on the outside, so this bag could be any generic messenger bag. There's no clue that it could be holding thousands of dollars of equipment.

CONS:

If you don't have enough equipment to really fill it, it's a bit of overkill.

I actually thought about using it as a diaper bag, but it seems like it might be a little hard to clean if anything spilled on the inside.

OVERALL, I can see how this would be a rockin' bag to have if you were a professional photographer or had lots of equipment you needed to carry around at the same time. But for me, as the advanced home user, it's overkill.",5.0,0
"This is my third pair of Dickies brand work pants. Two of the three pairs - in different styles, have similar problems.

I'm about 5'7"", 125 lbs and the size 4 is the right size for me. Unfortunately, in Dickies' carpenter style, the waist is higher and wider than their cargo workpant style. I have wide hips and a small waist, so after purchasing a pair of the cargo pants and liking the style and fit, I was disappointed when I tried these on. These pants ride higher and looser in the waist than other Dickies.

Other reviewers have stated how rugged the material is. I would add the caveat that it's rugged--by Women's clothing standards. This isn't fashion attire, but it isn't the heavy duck cloth typical in many Men's work pants, either. I can't speak to the working conditions of other people, but I work in a factory alongside men and the work I perform puts the same strains on my clothes - it would be nice if my clothes could last as long. These pants are new, so we'll see.

These pants had frayed seams right out of the bag. I examined the seams closely, and it appears to be cosmetic (the fringe of the under-layer of fabric didn't lay quite right when the crotch seams were stitched) - not structural. As this is the second pair I've gotten with seam problems, I'd say Dickies has a quality control problem.

Pros:
Good quality materials
Good length and style
Rear pockets big enough for my wallet

Cons:
Material could be more rugged
Inconsistent sizing across styles
Poor assembly at seams - fraying sewn in at crotch",3.0,0
"Our Vet recommended these Pill Pockets for our 4 kittens when we switched from using a topical flea medication to a pill form.  When we got home, I placed my order and I was excited to see how this would work!  When this product was delivered, I quickly tore open the package to see what it looks like and exactly how it smells.  Well, I was bummed when all the pill pockets were smashed together instead of being individually separated into a pill pocket form.  However, I did make it work by tearing off a piece, rolling it into a ball and then I placed the pill inside of the ball I made.  I would have returned it but, I did not want to wait any longer since the kittens were overdue on this medication. As for how it smells, it really does not smell like a Salmon flavor to me anyways.

Out of the 4 kittens, 3 loved the pill pockets and wanted more!  Each kitten had their own pill because of their weight so, I kept them separated.  My first kitten, loved the pill pocket, she swallowed it with the pill included.  I was very happy and thought this would be a breeze! Not so much, LOL!  The second kitten ate the pill pocket but, he spit out the pill so, I tried it again and the same thing happened.  The exact same thing happened with the third kitten! When I got to the fourth kitten, she ran away after taking one sniff of the pill pocket.

"I can only give this item two stars.  That is because I like the print and the material, and the overall design of the dress.
I am a U.S. size 8/9.  I have recently lost weight, so Ihave trouble sizing online items sometimes. I first ordered a U.K. size 14 in this dress, then a U.K. size 12.  I don't know if they do things much different in the UK but it seems I must be a non-existent size which is in between the two previously mentioned sizes.
The size 12 is extremely tight.  It fits well in the hip and midsection area but is ridiculously tight in the chest area....to the degree that it smashed my breasts into pretty much two flat pancakes that looked really unusual from a side profile.  Boobs are supposed to be round.  I needed help getting in and out of the dress, since there is no zipper, I struggled pulling it over my head.  The size 14 was way too large...the dress fit baggy and awkward everywhere.  There was more than enough room in the chest area (surprisingly) but that meant that the bottom half of the dress was huge around my hips.  It wasn't flattering at all because the dress didn't have any need to cling or stretch to anything, it just hangs there.

I don't care to return these dresses because the shipping rate will probably cost more than the dress itself, so i'll probably sell them.  Long story short, this is a beautifully designed dress but PLEASE be careful if you are a busty woman because it may not flatter you but FLATTEN you.  Also, the fit of this dress may make you consider if this is a dress for a night out, or if it's work-appropriate.
This would work well for a woman with a small chest but ample hips.

- very easy to put together. The instructions are very simple to follow. It is a little time consuming because you have to screw in nails about 15 times or more throughout. It probably took me about 30 minutes.
- it is well structured. I'm not too worried about it falling apart anytime soon. My one year old is pretty rough with it and it doesn't even flinch.
- comes with two cars (one boy and one girl). You can also use different cars to that you may already have like hot wheels and the smart wheels cars. Our kids have all kinds that they use.
- Even my 5 year old enjoys it. Sometimes I have to remind her that she needs to let her little brother play with it.
- No batteries needed! We all know that's always a plus.
- let's kids use their imagination! Any toy that allows kids to do this is a plus for me.

Cons:
- It is a bit large. We live in a apartment and this takes up a lot of space. It's about 37 inches tall and 18 inches in width. If you have the space, won't be an issue.
- It doesn't have two entrance paths so the cars can't race. This didn't seem like a big deal but my 5 year old has been taking about this, so I thought I would add that in here.
- There's a lot of pieces when building so for some it may be overwhelming. Don't worry the pieces all are numbered and colored so very easy to identify when building.

Overall, I would highly recommend this toy for little children. Even adults can have fun with it.",5.0,0
"Aside from the color looking like goldfish scales or ""prison"" orange and not a lovely tangerine like I was expecting. I was disapointed in the construction.

Hardest part was getting the pump motor part off, but I followed someone else's instructions and put a little petroleum jelly on the threads and it is now much easier to get on and off.  Be careful putting it together or you might break off one of the little fins on the pump motor that recirculates the water.  I broke off one of the four little plastic fins when I was trying to figure out how to assemble it the first time, but it still works fine so far.",4.0,0

"Bought as a gift for my kids for christmas. They have really enjoyed this track. They love that they can race two cars at once. It is a bit annoying that it is virtually impossible to get the track to lay completely flat. The most logical way to store it is rolled and so the end of the track is always curled up. That said, it isn't a big issue. If we want the end to be flat we hold it down with books or something similar. We have only used the suction cup attqchment. It works very well, we stick it on the window and it stays very securely. The track is flexible, so sometimes we put things under the track to create variety. It is a great track and it has received a lot of play time in the year that we have had it. All of my kids (ages 2,4,6,8) have really enjoyed it.",5.0,0

I said that the company was great because when I bought the kitchen it was missing the sink. I went to the website to see about ordering a replacement sink. I was afraid that the sink would cost me as much as the entire kitchen cost, but they sent the replacement sink to me for free.

"I was kind of hoping these would replace my current brown everyday work shoes (Doc Martin-looking Sketchers oxfords).  They do seem comfy enough to fill that purpose, but I don't think they're the sort of shoe to wear outside in any kind of winter weather.  More of a spring/fall shoe.  They're just not that substantial -- either the sole or upper.  The leather is super soft, broken in unlike any shoe I've ever seen and kind of thin-- sort of like kid leather.  This makes them very comfy, but not like anything I'd want to step in a slushy puddle in, plus I don't think they'll be very warm at all.  I deemed them to ""fit as expected"" because as a 7.5, the 8s were a little big on me.  Don't know why they couldn't manage half sizes.  They seem to run a bit narrow, also, but they are so soft and pliable I have no doubt they'll stretch out easily if your foot isn't excessively wide (mine is a tad wide).  At any rate, they seem well worth the bargain price I paid ($25, I think), so I will keep them.
Update:  I should also emphasize that the soles aren't very supportive.  They sort of have a ""barefoot"" feel like 5-toe shoes or minimal running shoes -- not a bad thing at all, but might not work for some.  You might say they are like a moccasin dressed up as an oxford.",4.0,0

It doesn't take long to play (only three minutes to be exact) and you don't need a lot of space to play it.  It uses a lot of the same skills as scrabble, but unlike in scrabble you won't keep getting beaten every time by that brainy uncle who must have memorized the dictionary, because most of the words that can be found are only 3 or 4 letters long, and even younger kids have a fair chance to win(occasionally a very long word can be found however - my personal triumph was the 8-letter ""nicotine"").  Also, you WILL learn new words you never knew existed from this game when people guess them and make you look them up - crazy words like ""hie"" and ""tat"" and ""coe"".

"I have an orange tabby who has vomited after her breakfast almost every morning for the past ten years. The numerous veterinarians who have examined her agreed that she eats so quickly she might as well being inhaling her food, causing her to regurgitate quickly after she finished. It didn't matter if it was canned or dry food we fed, or how expensive or what ""formula"" she was given. This habit keeps her from gaining excess weight, but she would be, naturally, incredible unhappy and very vocal about losing her first meal of the day. We felt like we had tried everything to make things better for her - until we purchased this cute ball or ""globe"" as we like to call it.

The ""globe"" is very durable, easy to put food into, and the holes are adjustable so almost any dry food your cat eats will work with this ball. The concept is very simple and I can hardly believe it took so long to find this on the market. Our cat quickly learned to use her nose to nudge the globe around and is rewarded with a few pieces of food which she quickly eats, and then she starts nudging again. It takes her about 7-8 minutes to get all the food out of the ball and now she never vomits after she finishes her meal. This also helps her to get in a little play time as she loves to swat it around when it is empty.

We plan to get a few extras - and in different colors! - since we have more than one cat. Should they develop the same problem, or the first ball needs to be replaced, we'll have back-ups! Five stars for the ""globe""!!!!!",5.0,0

"These are very nice container boxes for the price (which at present is about $10 for a set of four). The build quality is pretty good  the containers are thick enough that they don't bend or rack if you twist it which gives me confidence that they will stand up to a good amount of use (and abuse). The lids are thinner, but still of good quality. The lids snap on with a firm snap so you know it is sealed. I am, however, concerned about the longevity of the lid snaps since they are all-plastic with just a crease line to serve as the hinge.

The lid remained firmly attached even after I dropped it several times from desk height to a tile floor, and tossed it around while it was in a laptop bag (in other words, a normal usage pattern for people such as myself who have a tendency to drop things often). No cracks or splits in the plastic either.

It is sized more for a kids-size meal than an adult. The overall dimensions are fine, but you cant fill up the compartments to the top of the lid with items such as pasta since the partitions do not extend to the top  they only extend up about 1.25 inches. That puts a limit on how much you can fill each compartment (provided, of course, that you want the food to remain contained in each compartment).

On the plus side, they are very attractive. The base is crystal clear and the lids (which come in four colors) are transparent. It would look just fine for both a school lunch or an office lunch.

Not perfect, but well worth considering if you're looking for an inexpensive set of lunch containers.

"POk - Thorough-but-to-the-point review bc these are $$ and purposeful (warmth/tread/hiking).

VERDICT: GREAT BOOTS.

Size:
Runs one size small, as many said (I wear a 5 and have NEVER tried on a shoe I could not fit into! Lol.)  I didn't take off a star for it bc it's warned about enough on here to know.

Height:
At a short-legged 5'4"", they ended @ 1.5"" below the knee (so not as curiously high as as many found). HOWEVER, bigger size, bigger proportions. My 5s surely run a inch shorter than a 10 would.

Fit:
Slightly narrow, but leather stretches/adjusts to your foot, so... Not much breaking in for me.

Quality/Warmth:
Leather is soft and nice.
Lining is ideal and warm.
The top studs actually keep the laces in place (I rarely see that!) contoured and supported my foot well (nothing spectacular either if you have special needs there) a just average).
Can't attest to durability bc they're new.
And, of course, the laces provide complete adjustment to your own foot, while the side zipper lets you keep it that way (and makes the on/off process quick and easy.) What a concept! Never thought it would be so hard finding a lace/zip winter boot.

WHAT THE ...?!m
There is a slippery finish on the soles that i was sliding all all over the place. I think (HOPE!!!!) it rubs off as you wear it. Still - makes you wonder and have to use it beyond return to know, and you can't evaluate the real tread before committing.  Not cool. Lost a star.",4.0,0
"I decided to jump on the chromebook bandwagon since so many people were raving about it. I will say that if you're used to having a Windows laptop and expect this to feel the same, you will be very disappointed. Sure you can check your email, browse the web or watch YouTube, but that's as far as it goes. It's capabilities won't really go past that. I wanted to Skype, and I could... If I went to their site each time and used their web extention. No option to download the app to make Skype just one click away. The same happened when I wanted to get a torrent downloader. None work with chromebook, and extentions that might have were a hassle to figure out. I didn't have a fresh goat or virgin to sacrifice on hand to make this task seamless. Not being able to download popular apps for all of my favorite things was the ultimate deal breaker for me. Some people will say you can do anything on a chromebook you can do on a windows or Mac laptop, but who wants to spend their day finding loop holes in a new system. I want simple with an easy user interface.

The good side; if you don't want all the fancy bells and whistles and just feel like browsing the web and checking your email, this will be perfect for you. If you have a Gmail account, you'll love it even more with the way it integrates your account with everything made by Google.

"I am happy with the Breeze cat box system, however it is taking some adjustment as we have 6 cats, (all rescues). Most of them get along well, as 4 of them are related, so I have luckily been able to use less litterboxes than the experts suggest, (one more litter box than you have cats). My current house is smaller than our old one, so we had to go from 5 litter boxes to 3 boxes with clumping litter. I decided to change to this system in an attempt to be cleaner overall. Because of the 6 cats to 3 boxes, I do notice a particular odor from the urine. The cats are all spayed females. I think because this is new to me, I let the pad stay too long, and I was also used to using a litter additive to counteract odor. There is of course no tracked litter all over the floor, which is great, and it is very easy to clean. None of the cats have shown any problem with the change, (I did one box at a time). I now just need to figure out which pads need changing when, based on how many cats use a particular box to urinate in. So I believe it is simply an adjustment phase. I have a feeling I will be changing these pads every couple of days, but as I said, we have 3 boxes for 6 cats. Overall I am happy with this system. I did notice that the Japanese have the same product offered with a dome cover, which would be nice. This system makes the most sense of any I have seen so far.",5.0,0

"Nice unit, although shipped with old firmware that supposedly has problems under 10.3.9. Since the drive has no direct contact with the case, and there is no fan, I would be reluctant to use it for a hot running drive.

"I gave this as a gift, but we all enjoy it.  The frame has handy features and is easy to use.  One thing I didn't realize before purchasing was EXACTLY how one got the photos on the frame.  I saw the option to insert a memory card so I assumed there would  be a USB cable for transfer.  This isn't the case.  You need to put the photos on the memory card.  I didn't have a card reader, so I went to Wal-Mart and bought a 'holder' for my 4GB card for [..].  That essentially turned it into a 4GB USB memory stick.  Now I just plug that into my computer, add photos, and return it to the frame.  I enjoyed the included Kodak software.  It made it fast and easy to edit my pics, but it caused some incompatibility issues and I had to delete it.  If it will work for you, it is well worth installing.  I use my regular graphics program now.  The frame screen size of 5X7 sounds smallish, but actually is just fine.  We have it on a stand that is only about 4 ft. from the one chair and maybe 10 ft. from the other that we use regularly and the frame can be viewed fine.  We can also see pics easily as we walk past this area repeatedly.  I love that we can see our pics all the time now (or from 1p to 9P with the built in timer).

"Planning to travel to Japan meant a 14-hour flight  in coach!  That made it imperative that both my husband and I purchase and wear compression socks.  After I researched various brands and styles, Sockwell Mens Elevation Compression Socks, Black, Large/X-Large were better suited to my husbands picky preferences than other options.  Stockwell uses a higher percentage of natural fibers than many other brands of socks.  As a result, they wicked moisture better and did not make his feet to sweat more profusely.  They were firmer (20  30 mm Hg) than the majority of compression socks (10  20 mmHG).  The socks graduated compression and well-fitted feet made Sockwell Mens Elevation Compression Socks, Black, Large/X-Large the socks for him.

Sizing is always a challenge when it comes to purchasing any clothing online.  My husband wears an 11 to 11  Medium in shoes.  The Large/X-Large size fits him well and is comfortable.  At its maximum point, his calf is about 16 in circumference.  The socks extend to the crease in the back of his knees  about 17"" from the floor; this circumference of area also measures about 16.  His foot is 11 long and the circumference around the arch is about 9 .

Sockwell Mens Elevation Compression Socks, Black, Large/X-Large are constructed with care.  Unlike my socks that had a more prominent knot on one side of the toe area, my husbands socks had smooth toe seams.  The top of the sock has a rolled, zigzag-stitched hem that approximately 3/8 wide.  It has not rolled during wearing.

Although these socks can be machine washed and dried, I prefer to hand wash and dry them flat.  I believe this will increase their useful life.  Amazons price for these socks, combined with PRIME shipping and free returns, makes them a much better value than the same item purchased from one of the online travel clothing retailers.",5.0,0

"This mount lasted only about 2 years and it was placed under a protective eavestrough.  The biggest problem is that it is made almost exclusively for VERTICAL mounting (non very ""universal"").  Although I was able to get it positioned in a way that would allow a mount perpendicular to the siding, I would definitely NOT recommend it.  It is difficult to adjust, and it tends to slip.  In fact, even in a vertical position, the outer mount collar has an annoying tendency to rotate.  There is a thumb type knob, but this is practically useless.  There is also a screw ""port"" in the other side, and if it were possible to thread something in there, you might get better stability.

"If you have young WWE fans in your house (I kind of hope you don't, because that stuff is not well-suited to viewing for children!), they will probably enjoy playing with something like this. The recommended age for this toy is 6+, and I'd say that is probably about right. Many 6-year-olds will be able to assemble this toy, though some will struggle with it. Unless you want to assemble it yourself and keep repairing it yourself, you had better not give this to any kid younger than 6 years old.

This set CAN be assembled in many different configurations, and that will give it a bit more longevity in the life of its play. The biggest drawback to this toy is that it doesn't come with a single WWE action figure. It would take two to make it a ""complete"" toy, yet it doesn't even come with one. To me, that's just absurd. Every playset needs to come with one or more figures to populate it, and when I see manufacturers pumping out stuff like this that forces parents to purchase more stuff to even make it fun, it really grinds my gears. The action figures that are made for this playset run $20 each, so you can plan on spending an additional $40 on top of the cost of this set to even make it ""playable."" That makes it a $90 investment for a simple toy that will - in all likelihood - not be a great time consumer for your kids. Ridiculous! There are many better products for you to invest in that will produce longer play time and better stimulation of the imagination than this toy. Skip this one!

I just can't give a positive recommendation to something so incomplete.",1.0,0

"I have worn Reebok and Nike over the years and have to say I have been happier with Reebok. In fact the last pair of Nike I got started to come apart in less than a month. These are consistant with what I expect from Reebok. The arch support is average but good in this sneaker. This is a comfortable sneaker that you can wear all day. I really like the 3/4 top a lot. The soles are comfortable give good traction on wet and dry surfaces. I walk 2 miles a day in these and my feet do not hurt.  Reebok's DMX Foam may have something to do with that.

Reebok DMX Foam is a soft and responsive foam compound used to deliver long-lasting cushioning. The focus is to deliver cushioning in the areas players need it most at the ideal time. In the footbed area, DMX Foam is soft and cushioned for high levels of comfort. Meanwhile, closer to the ground, DMX Foam is sturdier and more responsive to provide shock absorption as feet hit the ground.

I think I will be sticking with Reebok in the future because of their consistancy. My Reebok sneakes have lasted me about 9 months on average with everyday wear though. I have gotten as much as a year of wear out of some of them but that was pushing it a bit.  I am going to order another pair of these because I don't want to come back and find out they are not available in a year when I need a new pair.",5.0,0

"Outstanding product -- I needed a place to feed my skinny cats at their leisure, feed my handicapped kitten, and keep my fat cat on a diet. This works GREAT -- skinny cats love to play all over and jump up to the top house to feed when they are hungry; fat cat has a food timer next to the whole setup to feed her limited diet: she can't jump up and too fat to really want to go into the small house below, and the handicapped kitten gets fed canned food on the first level (she's learning where the food is still). Great solid product... it's rather large (we put in the basement - works out great), easy to put together, If you are a real cat lover - this is definitely a good investment. I have house rabbits too, and once things are set up for them near this condo - I think they will enjoy jumping on it and in the houses.

"I'm really enjoying this lens. It's been an excellent choice, and has given me a lot more options than just my Nikon 50mm 1.4 D prime. I use it as my all-time walk around lens now.

Pros:

Construction quality is great. No dust in the lens, built big and tough. I took it camping with me and it held up great.
VC is fantastic. Not too loud for me. I like that I can hear it put itself into action.
Photos are sharp and clean.
Low light photos are no problem.
The lens lock button works well so the lens doesn't creep, but don't really need it. The zoom ring is tight enough to hold it.
Lens is easy to operate in manual focus mode too.
Price price price! Much less expensive when compared to the Nikon counterpart that doesn't have VC.

Cons:

Focus is not prime-lens-fast, but definitely quick enough to get the fast shot off  (just comparing to my prime 50mm 1.4).
Doesn't focus well on far away mountains / clouds. Sometimes the focus has a hard time locking on to things my prime has no problems with.
The lens is big, does add size and weight to my Nikon D300, but it balances well on the body.

My photos with the lens are here: [...]. I label the photos with tags on the right, so you know which lens was used.

I'm also a big fan of the suede shoes, and will continue to purchase them as I wear them all the time. I like that the suede sole is not too slippery, and that the color is a little brighter than I expected. They are a little too tight, but that's good because they're soft and comfortable.

  If you want a more ""neutral"" sound or prefer instrumental and vocal songs, this is the phone to get, not implying that it lacks bass as it fairs quite well for its bass as well. To me, this is a ""bright"" sounding phone as compared with X10i.
  Built quality wise, top notch... loved the thick and durable feeling cables that it came with, hardly any tangles. Cable noise when brushed against your clothes are still there but very minimal.
  I would still stick with X10i due to the comfort it provides and its sound quality fairs quite well against the Ety as well. And I am a big fan of a ""warm"" sounding phone and X10i fits my book.

I hade been giving the Princess Pia (my aging Siamese cat) other products to help ease her arthritic joints, asd could not see any improvement. Then I tried Nutramax Cosequin.

I can't think WHY I keep thinking my (overweight) cat will starve, but I finally overcame my fear and kept putting it into her food - and she finally ATE it!

"I have seven cats, no dogs. I sometimes get these purebites that are marketed to dogs because the bags are so much bigger. The pieces in the ""dog"" ones are bigger & sometimes harder than the ones for cats. I do  have to break up the big pieces and eliminate the really hard ones, but it is such a good value that it seems worth the extra work.

edit 4/8/16- when I got towards the bottom of the bag some of the pieces were VERY hard and not usable for cats. Probably just fine for most dogs since they love chewing on even harder things like bones... but I think I will stick to the cat version for my cats in the future.",4.0,0

"This is one of the best Mac laptops on the market, period.  (The best PC laptop on the market, in my opinion is the Sony VAIO Z series with the high res screen option).

I recently traded the 15"" for this 13"" and although I greatly miss the 15"" screen and the wonderful speakers on the 15"" (the 13"" speakers are good but not as rich and bassy as the 15"") but overall I love this smaller machine.

Let me get what I don't like out of the way:

--wish the screen resolution were much higher (compare to the Sony VAIO Z series which has such outrageous screen resolution)
--wish it were a bit lighter that 4.5 lbs (although this machine is exceptionally sturdy, so willing to deal with a little bit heavier than similar size machines)

And that's it for the wish list.  Now what I absolutely love:

--the ergonomics -- way better than anything else out there, PC or Mac.
--backlit keyboard, comfortable typing area (feels luxurious to rest your hands on the surface of the textured aluminum area)
--fast OS (Snow Leopard), fast machine, great power management
--first machine i've owned that doesn't get overly hot, in fact even barely warm

What I do highly recommend though is to get -- if you can afford it -- is a 256Gb SSD (Corsair).  This gives the machine extra speed, better battery power, and true longevity.  No need to worry about damaging the disk while traveling, defragmenting (oh, so glad that era is over).  This is an expensive option ($650 or so) but really well worth it by a long shot.  The SSD equipped machine will last you a long time.",5.0,0

"I was really looking forward to this Vantec hard drive dock because I have several Vantec products from years past that have nicer streamlined designs and built solid compared to the competitors.  I figured this new hard drive dock would have a similar solid feel.  But the FIRST TIME I attempted to remove a 2.5"" drive, the door flap broke off!  The drive got snagged against the door flap and it took only a slight pressure to pop it off and break the plastic.  Then I realized that this plastic flap is not even necessary, it's just an alignment guide, so I removed it as shown in the photo to expose a larger opening.  It is easy to line up with the SATA connector to insert a 2.5"" drive even without this silly door flap (unless someone is blind or working in the dark).  I am happy with this hot rod ""mod"" to the unit.  Now the next disturbing aspect is how bright the LED is.  I mean this thing lights up the entire room!  I can use it as a flashlight.  I don't understand why the neighbor down the street has to be able to see the LED shining through my window blinds.  Other than that, it works nicely with excellent plug-and-play capability and transfer rates.  On the bottom of the unit it says Made in China which explains the quirks.

"I've bought 3 of these cables. The 1st one was to replace a $230 50ft hdmi cable that was sold to me by the company that I bought a projector from. Someone tried to swap devices and broke the head of the expensive cable, so I bought one of these to replace it and it worked every bit as good as the expensive cable.

When we set up our 2nd theater room, I just went with this cable again.

I have noticed that some blu-ray players work better than others as do projectors/tvs as far as sending/receiving signals over longer distances. The cable doesn't seem to make that much difference - So I'd go with this cheaper cable and still feel safe that it will work for you.

PROS:
The price is great.
The cable is well made and thick
Performs every bit as good as the expensive cables.

CONS:
I did have one cable break that I used in a mobile set up. The cable got a short after repeated set ups and take downs - as long as you don't plan on moving the cable around a lot after it is in place you shouldn't have any problems. The cable was broken when an inexperienced person coiled the cable up after use and folded the neck of the cable next to the head at a 90 degree angle (tightly wound) the cable still works but I have to ""jiggle"" it a little to get the connection to work correctly...
(Not the cables fault - but thought I'd mention in case you plan on using in a mobile set up)

Side note:
Sometimes if the tv or projector is turned on after the dvd player or whatever is sending the signal, I've gotten a no signal message. If I turn the projector on first or turn the dvd player off then back on the signal is picked up. Not sure if this has anything to do with the cable but didn't have that small problem with the expensive cable.",5.0,0

"The Dell USB 3.0 Dual Display Universal Dock D1000 is sleek, compact, and works very well.  Having used past Dell USB docks, I can say this new model does not come with the compatibility issues of prior versions.  The ability to utilize dual displays, plus it's compactness make it a great option on your desk.

The D1000 doesn't come with an abundance of ports, but it's does the job.  If there were one flaw it might be the ports, but it's hard to fault it with the multiple video outputs, network, audio, and more than enough USB ports.  I tested this with two 24"" displays.  I used multiple computers, including a few different laptops and a Surface Pro 3.  This included Windows 7, Windows 8.1 and Windows 10.  I had a great experience with all variations.

The dock itself is fairly compact and go on top of your desk or on a shelf or other alternative.

"I really want to give this watch 5 stars, this watch is excellent, high quality, accurate, and great looking, but it loses a star for the weight. Don't get me wrong though i understand all types of these watches are going to be heavy when compared to my g shocks. Wearing the watch daily is not very comfortable, it is a bit heavy and can get sweaty during the summer which is normal, but after weaing my casio g shock which cost $150. I really appreciated the lightweight and comfort of the affordable g shock watch. The seiko is indeed a classy watch but the downside is that is it heavier than my g shock which i end up choosing to wear daily.

This is a great watch for going out and relaxing, but for sports, work, daily tasks, the g shock is my goto watch since its lighter weight and more comfortable with its resin band.

It is hard to make a steel watch very comfortable compared to a resin watch. Otherwise everything else is perfection..Seiko is one of my favorite brand of watches, I would say my top favorite, then Casio, but realistically my daily wear is a casio g shock. If you type of watch is the classy look, then seiko is the best. It's kinetic technology is my favorite, i love how it adjust back to the correct time after i wake it up by a few shakes. It is amazing how accurate this watch is, I set the time and date once, and have had this watch for 4 years and not once did i ever need to readjust the time or date, it has been accurate this whole time.  this watch is excellence, but i deduct one star because I feel its a bit heavy as it should be but just not my cup of tea for a daily wear since I have a lightweight casio g shock as my option.",4.0,0

"This is SO lightweight--it's a pleasure to lift. A friend tried this litter and found her cats walked around the house with it stuck to their feet. While all litter sticks to feet, this is light enough to make the trek much farther from the litter box.

My experience has been fine though. My cats don't care about it, they just use it. They DO seem to be able to 'toss' if farther when there's a lot of vigorous digging. The scent is just fine (I've read all the reviews about stinky litter and it smells the same to me as other Tidy Cats products.)

My only problem is the cost (4 stars). It's litter. It gets pooped and peed in and then I toss it. I don't see the purpose of spending the money on this--UNLESS you have trouble lifting the litter and it's either expensive (light) litter or no cat! THEN I say, this does the job, AND it's light!

I'm a woman, and was looking for a small, lightweight messenger style bag that would fit my wallet, keys, phone & other small necessities as well as my iPad, pencil, battery charger, cords... Etc. I wanted something sturdy, simple and well designed, but that appealed to my style. This bag met all my requirements and I've been really impressed by the quality and craftsmanship. I'm surprised at how roomy it is for what I feel is a smaller bag - even loaded up with all my stuff, I've always had room to spare.
During shipping, the box was slightly damaged and the bottom front corner of the bag was dented when I unpacked it. I decided to keep it, hoping with use it would work itself out with use, but it didn't and the dent remains. It adds character... That's what I'm going with :)
The only other thing I would wish for is an extra metal slide or something to keep the loops of the long strap together. When I shorten the strap, the strap doubles across itself and doesn't function well as a single strap when I go to grab it quickly... Just a minor thing really.

"It is now my go to litter for my cats.  I am traditioning away from the regular Tidy Cat clumping litter in the 35 lb buckets. Among the litter boxes I currently have are two identical litter boxes side by side, one with regular clumping litter and the other with the lightweight litter.  And my experience is that the Tidy Cat clumping litter has more dust then the Tidy Cat lightweight litter, and tracks less.  My cats don't show a preference from one over the other, but lugging around 35 lb buckets is making me make a preference.  This lightweight litter actually seems to clump harder.  And when you have to scoop through 3-4"" of litter to remove the clumps, the lightweight litter makes a big difference.  In the past, I have kept 200-300 pounds of litter on hand, now I can have half that weight on hand, which is easier on me.  And yes, litter tracks.

I don't know, and there is no way I Can know, if the Phycox has had a beneficial effect on my dog.  I do know that the Phycox claim to fame is its content of phycocyanin.  However, a chewable contains at most 40 mg of phycocyanin.  The studies of phycocyanin that they list on their website, which were done in Cuba and on Rats, showed a benefit when the rats were given between 100-300 mg per kg.  At 37 lbs, my dog is about 17 kg, which means that she would need 1700-5100 mg of phycocyanin per day to get the same benefit. So it is unlikely that my dog will benefit much from this particular product.",2.0,0

"This stuff seems to work.  We foster cats and ringworm is a constant problem as many feral cats carry the fungus and it is easily transmitted from cat to cat.  It is a bit expensive, but I cannot complain as it seems to work.  We applied it to a all white cat that had developed the classic ""bald"" spots and under black light glowed brightly.  As I applied the diluted product to the animal I notice strands of the fungus breaking away from the main body of the infestation!  I have never seen this before.  It has always taken 3 weeks or more to get the infestation down and for hair to start to grow back!  It is a tenacious fungus and infects humans as well!  It's not perfect and it is not an overnight cure.  After about two weeks, I can say the cat (kitten) is fungus free and suffered no ill effects.  We foster up to 15 kittens so it's a chore to isolate those cats with infestation from the others as the spores are airborne.  So it takes a lot of vacuuming, cleaning changing bedding and treatment to get control again.  If you have ringworm on a cat, give this a try.",4.0,0

"The problem with buying a dress shirt, is that they are cut to fit 95% of the guys out there. So they are boxy. However, deviate from the norm, then you'll end up with a shirt that isn't long enough (if you're tall), maybe doesn't close around the stomach (if you're chubby), or pinches around the shoulders and upper arms (if you're muscular). I have the problem of shirts too tight around my shoulders and upper arms. Also, I can't move my arms forward without restriction, because it's too tight across the back. Sometimes I move up to a 2XL, but then it's way too baggy around my stomach. I have no idea what those muscleheads do who are jacked up on gear, but just being thick and solid, causes me problems enough. Since my thighs are pretty strong, I have problems with pants that I can sit down in too. That's when I discovered spandex woven into the cloth. If you're bulked up from the gym, its the only option you have, unless you want to buy clothes way oversized, and wear a belt. This shirt fits me well. It isn't tight around my arms and shoulders, since the cloth has give, when I move my arms. The waist doesn't billow over my waist either. I have long arms, but it fits well with arm length. The fabric has give, but it's not elastic the way socks are for example. Also you can forget to hang this shirt on a hanger, and still be able to wear it the next day without ironing. (It smooths out, when you have it on.) I like the blue graph paper design. Best of all, I'm not pinched around my chest and back either. Wearing a shirt that doesn't fit well, because I have to buy up a size might not bother me personally. However, a shirt like this is more form fitting, so I look a little neater.

"No issue with the merchant - ClothingShopOnline shipped the item promptly and it was clearly brand-new - but I buy these extra-huge sizes to allow for the inevitable shrinkage in the wash.  I'm not a massive guy, just taller than most...and my goal is to start out with something closer to the size of a tent, and end up with something that fits after it's been washed.  So I tried this XXXL sweatshirt on and while it was good and roomy and baggy (as expected, remember, I want that extra room so that when it shrinks it'll be fine), the sleeves were just a hair longer than what would have been expected from an XL.  So right now, unwashed and right out of the box, the sleeve length is basically perfect.  Which means, once washed, these sleeves will be far too short.  Actually, I bet these *are* sleeves for an XL shirt; the seam at the shoulder is almost down to my bicep, meaning they added material in the torso area but not in the sleeves.  I have to laugh - what kind of individual must the manufacturer have been envisioning when determining what XXXL should be?  Maybe a three-foot-tall troll with little nubs for arms?  I'll probably keep it and just wash it in cold (and air dry it)...since the weight is nice and it seems to be of decent enough quality.",2.0,0

"I like this product as it works better on dog toenails than toenail clippers.  I just received the product today and ordered it b/c a neighbor who owns a larger Bully type dog uses the Dremel on his dog's toenails rather than toenail clippers.  The Dremel is easy to use and the instructions are clear and concise.  The dog (98 lb Labrador) was very calm while I sanded his toenails usually he fights me all the way when using toenail clippers.  The only drawback to this product is that the battery life isn't very long.  I was able to complete two paws or 8 toenails and 2 dewclaws before the battery ran down.  The charger plugs directly into an electrical socket and the battery is easily removed from the Dremel.  The Dremel is easy to hold in your hand and maneuverable so I like that attribute.  I would suggest wearing goggles or glasses and a carbon mask due to the amount of dust produced and get a grittier sandpaper if your dogs toenails are very long or over 1/4"" thick.  I noticed that they do sell Mandrels, drums and other types of attachments for the Dremel and different gradations of sandpaper etc.  This product is much better than that battery run ""As Seen On TV"" thing that I purchased, used one time and threw in the trash.",5.0,0

"My girl, who is 7, is in that ""mommy"" stage and really wanted this doll. It might be good for younger children, but at her age it just wasn't a good match. As some others have mentioned, the clothing does not come off. A huge part of the fun, at least with my child, is dressing up her dolls in different outfits. Also, because of the way the clothing is sewn on, it does not lift up far enough for you to really put the diaper up around the doll's bottom. So the diaper was a waste as well. The quality of the doll's hair was horrible! She looked like she was going bald! If I had to do it all over again I would buy a Baby Alive. At least you can change their clothes, they actually have real looking diapers (not like this one which was a thin piece of cloth, not even resembling a diaper) and they actually eat and drink. This one may be a hit with younger toddlers but not for girls who are older than 5. And even at that, I would NOT pay $45+ dollars for this. It should be $20 at the most.",1.0,0

"UPDATE 1/10/2016:
Despite the poor quality of these items and the doubled price, I decided to buy some more with plans to reinforce the hilt from the inside to withstand normal play.  The sabres have changed!  The buttons now have different and LESS DESIRABLE FUNCTIONALITY.  There is one switch that has an on/off position.  When in the off position, the other button does nothing.  With the on/off switch on, the other switch toggles between on and off- pretty useless!  The saber cycles through the colors and the sounds (which are, at least, still Star Wars sound effects), so that you can no longer select which color blade you want.  What self-respecting Jedi (or Sith, or Ren, for that matter) would carry a saber which has a random color with every swing?????

ORIGINAL REVIEW:

One of the sabres arrived broken out of the box with a tiny piece of the plastic at the butt end of the handle where the speaker is located broken off.  Otherwise, these were (WERE) super cool and fun out of the box.  It goes downhill from there.  Fast.

All three failed in some way after just hours of play, one failing literally within minutes.  On two of them, a flimsy plastic fin broke loose inside the battery compartment, allowing the batteries to migrate around inside the handle, rendering the lights and sounds inoperable.  I was able to repair these two somewhat easily by unscrewing the handle and gluing the fin back in place, but the fact remains that they broke after just a couple hours of moderate play.

On the third sabre, the sound stopped working, again after just hours of play.  I have not attempted to repair this one, and have not opened the handle to see if a solder would fix it since I don't have a solder gun anyway.

Spend a little more on something that might last at least a week.  No, I would not buy this again.",1.0,0

My foot is pretty hard to fit because I wear a 7-1/2 AA.  It's just a hit and miss when I order a pair of shoes in a brand that I've never worn, but I read advice saying to size down on these shoes, so I did.  I ordered a 7B and they fit perfectly.  I think I'll wear them enough to see if the fabric stretches before I order another pair, though, in case I need a 6-1/2.

The shoes are light as a feather.  We'll see how they hold up, but I plan to wear them everywhere.  They have an insert that reminds me of one I used to buy for high heels.  It has a small arch support that I didn't expect and should make the shoes more comfortable for long periods of walking.  You're reminded by printing on each interior sole that they give a new pair of shoes to a child in need for every pair purchased.  Nice.

It engages her mind to put in food, peanut butter, or a treat.  She will work on it to get the food out.  When she gives up, to keep it sanitary, you can put it in the top rack of your dishwasher.

Further, to have more fun, roll it on a hard floor or driveway and it won't roll straight.  It will give your dog something to chase and pounce on.  Again, this will make life a bit more interesting for them.

So now I carry it on my back like a backpack, it is real easy to get on and off, padded straps are comfortable.
One of the main reasons I bought this carrier was as an emergency device. If we have to evacuate I needed a carrier for my cat that I could manage. Since he is so heavy I knew that I wouldn't be able to carry him for extended periods, so I can wheel him. It is big enough to carry some supplies too, like water and food and a blanket. The screen on the top and sides gives the cat some air, and it can be covered if it rains. I think it is the perfect item.",5.0,0

"I'm the type of person who, when I find a brand and style I like, I stick with them. My problem was my usual brand has been lacking in quality as of late. for the past 3 years, I was going through them very quickly. It was probably due to the frequent washings but I was having to replace them yearly.

So I decided to give Carhartt a try. I have recently switch to their jeans because of quality dropping in my usual brand and style so I decided to give these a try. They are strongly constructed and look good. Not as much room in the seat and thigh area as I would like but I'm getting used to it. Have been washed a few times and the color has not faded.

Some are saying that they feel rough and stiff. Well, yeah. Compared to my previous brand (which I will probably by for casual occasions and not need to was as frequently), these aren't very soft. But I was going for durable. While I work in an office, I do have to do some physical stuff. May I suggest using a liquid fabric softener. I always use it and have no problem with these pants.

Just remembered, I purchased these in blue with the same measurements. Even less room in the seat and thigh (meaning really tight you-know-where). Not sure what's up with that but I plan to get more in black and hopefully that was a fluke.",4.0,0

"(Wife): Basic Paw Patroller. You must attach stickers yourself. There are also 1-2 other things you must attach / get in place before letting a kid play with this one. So, I unpackaged the thing and prepped it before giving it to our daughter for Christmas. Comes with Ryder figure and ATV. The ATV is pretty sturdy and good on carpet. But, Ryder's legs are rather fragile. The Patroller trailer section only holds THREE (3) medium-sized vehicles while closed. BUT, you CAN stuff an entire set of Paw Patrol figurines inside the Paw Patroller when closed IF you use figurines, racers and/or an appropriate combination of figurines and mid-sized vehicles. The cab of the truck holds 4-5 figurines. (Five if you really pack 'em in, possibly plus 1-2 removable packs. )

Here's what we stuff in our Patroller (while still being able to close it):

Two medium-sized vehicles with riding figures (Ryder & ATV, and Everest & snowmobile);
Two small racers (Chase and Zuma);
Two figurines plus their detachable packs (Skye and Rocky);
Two figurines with spring-action packs (Robodog and Tracker); and
Two figurines with other features (Rubble and Marshall). Reasonably sturdy Paw Patroller. Makes noise. Comes with battery. Rather large. Opens to reveal a second floor. Not bad for transporting or storing all Paw Patrol figures / vehicles IF you plan ahead. Our daughter enjoyed it for Christmas.",4.0,0

"This PWOW ErgoFit earbuds are very good for its price. It's very comfortable and have great sound quailty. One of the feature that I like about this earbuds because it block out background noise and wire cord are well made. For the price, I love it has built-in microphone to answer your calls, a switch to toggle between iPhone or android and a sliding volume control. It can only allow you to adjust music volume only so in order to skip it to next song which you need to do on your phone. Also, they don't hurt my ears after a long-wear. Earbuds and headphones that is more bulky tend to hurt my ears because they fit too full in my ears but this earbuds doesn't hurt my ears at all. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking for a good pair of earbuds that are really cheap with good sound quailty.

Pros:
* Ultra-soft ErogoFit in-ear earbuds
* Multipurpose Remote: Volume control, music switching, hands-free call, open Siri in iPhones
* Built-in microphone and answer key: allowing hands-free calling

Cons:

"I redeemed points on Amazon and treated myself to this Frye bucket bag when it was massively reduced earlier in the Spring. The leather is super supple and the crossbody is a cinch to adjust (get my little joke there??). The bag has only one main compartment, but has the standard two slip pockets and a zippered pocket on the opposite side. Very nice neutral bone/off white color, however the leather gets EASILY dirty and of course the dye from my jeans rubbed off on the bottom of the bag (ironic, since it was the lining that I didn't care too much for!!). I'll have to really baby this bag and clean it each and every time I use it (even with wearing lighter colored clothing).

When you wheel this carrier around, the straps get caught in the wheels. After wheeling it around for 6 blocks, the straps were literally shredded.

The clasps for the removable shoulder strap is made of VERY cheap plastic, rather than metal so you have to be very careful with it, otherwise the plastic will snap.

"I love lava lamps, but this is a terrible ""tank"" for a Betta. It is much too small, the bubbles will be too strong and move the water more than a Betta will like, and there is no room at the top for them to breath. And from other reviews, the cap on this is air-tight. Your fish will suffocate (all fish require oxygen, it's dissolved in the water and without any air holes, there will be no oxygen. ) And if it is air-tight, the bubbles will increase the pressure inside the ""tank"", leading to stressing the material and the fish which is under the water. If you want this as a novelty light, go ahead. It's ridiculously overpriced for that (you can get a small real lava lamp for 1/3rd the price) but do not use it for a fish ""tank.",1.0,0

"So I ordered without really paying attention to details. Keep in mind that although the some people say it rolls, it really depends on how you apply it! I'm 5'5 147lbs. I'm not chubs, slimmer side BUT with a tummy apparently..I wish it was gone but oh well. Now I got a medium..the torso part goes all the way to my under boobs. I haven't tried making it go higher. But I can say my thighs and stomach feel tighter. It also lifts your butt, which is a plus! Give it a try. You can't tell you're wearing it and it doesn't cause pain when breathing.

Cons: it's tight, not as tight from the stomach as I would like. I did read some reviewers left this comment as well. It doesn't hurt from the torso as others do. The glue type of plastic in the back line helps it adhere to your skin so it doesn't roll.

Pros: I thought the material would be thicker. But nope, they feel like nylons! A bit tighter than nylons. Be careful when pulling it, you can rip it. I haven't ripped mine so we're good.

"Issues and/or things to note:
1. Body proportions are all on point except for his head which is kinda small especially in comparison to Cap unless his helmet is supposed to be skin tight LOL
2. Diaphragm/ab and waist points of articulation are pretty loose.
3. More gaps than usual/before in the sculpt to where you can see through a lot of the figure at the points of articulation. (ex: upper and lower neck gaps, tailbone(?) area, and etc.)
4. Weird sculpt/design in some places. Giant, flat knee joints again and quite a few pieces that are sculpted outward on the figure that you should be wary of in case of breaking off like 2 little tabs on the back and the elbows which stick out a lot this time in a pretty ugly way.

Improvements from older Iron Man figures:
1. Body proportions are way better; bulkier as it should be to represent an actual man in a suit.
2. Repulsors on palms are painted this time unlike on the Mark 45.
3. I appreciate the little blue paint lines in each of the mini arc reactors all around the suit because I expected them to all just be plain silver.

Other than those, it's still an overall awesome figure. I suggest you watch AnthonysCustoms review of it on youtube if you want more details.
This Mark 46 is to the Mark 45 as the AOU Cap is to the CW Cap; Lots of similarities in pros And cons. But in the end, this is indeed my favorite Iron Man figure to date and in my opinion I think it's the best one that's been released so far.",4.0,0

"(Written by Joseph's wife, Shiloh)

I bought the Jabra Cruiser 2 speakerphone for my 2007 Ford Freestyle since the cd player has no jack for an auxiliary cable, nor is it Bluetooth capable. I read many reviews of different in-car speakerphones, and decided to go with this one due to the good reviews and to the price. I have to say that the set up is ridiculously easy, or at least, it was easy for me with my iPhone 4S. My phone paired with the Cruiser immediately and it worked well. I turned on the FM transmitter, and it played songs from my phone onto 88.1FM quickly and the sound was great. Then, I called a friend who confirmed that I was coming in loud and clearly through the speakerphone (though I was not driving at the time). However, on the FM frequency, I had to turn up the sound significantly to hear her well.

Pros:
-Easy set up.
-Loud sound on the FM frequency for music from my phone.
-Comes with a in-car charger.
-Callers could hear my voice loud and clear (at least so far).
-The Cruiser announces every function you do, so that is nice, especially when it lets you know that you are paired with your phone, what radio frequency it is using, etc.

Cons:
-The charger wire would be annoying if used while driving due to the fact that it hangs right next to my gear shifter.
-On the FM frequency, I had to turn up the volume significantly to hear the person on the other end of the line.
-Does not turn off automatically. You have to flip the little switch on the side of the box in order to turn it off and on.

"This lap loom is a nice starting point (and perhaps ""enough"" for those who don't wish to upsize) for children and adults who want to learn how to weave. Unlike some other products on the market for weaving, it's made by a loom company and yields a ""genuine"" woven product. The basic premise is to repeatedly go over and under vertical warp threads with a shed stick. One shed stick can stay in the loom at all times (until nearing the end), but on every other pass through, this weaving process must be repeated. Once the shed stick is pulled onto its long edge, every other string rises up, and yarn loaded onto a stick shuttle is passed through, and the stick shuttle lowered. This yarn is beaten down, and the process is repeated. Although the loom has its limitations due to its small size, projects that can be made from such a small loom include a placemat, small doll blanket, pillow, wall-hanging, and purse. Users can also, of course, seam together more than one project to create larger pieces of fabric. The set comes with one project to work on, and the included instruction booklet gives suggestions about what it can be turned into. The included sample project teaches how to do horizontal and vertical stripes. (I never realized how easy vertical stripes would be--you just do every other row with two different colors, and they ""magically"" form!)

Two extra parts are ""missing"" from this set. Although you can use it as is, you may also wish to get:
(1) Wonder Wand (by the same company), which helps speed up the process by pushing down every other warp thread. (2) Tapestry beater for pushing down the yarn. Otherwise, they recommend using a fork. The loom and accessories are unfinished wood. I ended up staining and varnishing them to help seal the wood and keep it looking nice, but this isn't really necessary. One extra suggestion: I find this easiest to work on with legs crossed. Otherwise, it's a bit large to be considered a ""lap loom.",5.0,0

"I bought this based on reviews, composition and price.
I needed a protective case for my portable HDs and in researching, decided to try this model.  I am not comfortable with soft cases and felt that some form of hard case was necessary for protection.
The case measures externally approximately 7"" x 4-1/4"" x 1-3/4"".  The interior storage cavity measures approximately 6"" x 3-1/2"" x 1-1/2"".
The outer covering is a tight weave synthetic fabric laid over a stiff plastic shell.  All observable stitching is single-stitch.  From what I can feel, the plastic does have some give but is reasonably stiff.
The interior has soft, fabric covered foam padding covering only one flat side and not the edges. It appears to be approximately 1/4"" or less thick.  There is a 1"" wide elastic band for HD retention.
The other side of the interior (which has no foam padding) has a mesh pocket approximately 3"" deep by 3-1/2"" wide.
The exterior of the case has a fabric pocket measuring approximately 3"" x 6-1/2"".  There are no straps or velcro.  The material appears to be some form of thin neoprene.
I noticed in the reviews that some mentioned that the zipper can be faulty.  In my particular case there appears to be no problem and zipping the case open or shut presented no discernable difficulties.  Long-term durability remains to be seen..  The zipper pull has a oblong hard rubber tab attached to it.
This case fits my portable HDs with room to spare.  The elastic band holds the devices securely, although how long it will retain adequate elasticity remains to be seen.
I use the exterior storage pocket for the HD cables as I am not comfortable having the cable with the USB connections rubbing against the HD on the other side of the case interior.
I feel that this case is adequate for casual use but I would like to see if there are cases with foam padding all around.",4.0,0

One day, after running a memory test for 8 hours, the server refused to boot.  After letting it sit for 8 hours, it booted just fine.  I immediately suspected a heat issue.

I purchased these coolers because they were active air movers versus just passive metal coolers. (and the price was right)

They've worked perfectly.  My server has not crashed once since I installed them!!  It runs much faster, and I've not noticed an increase in noise.

Prior to installing them, the chips were extremely hot to the touch after a memory test.  Today with the Air Coolers, they barely luke warm.

They are also extremely easy to install. Once you attach the mounting brackets, they just snap on.

"The Princess guitar is a pretty in pink starter guitar for small hands and short arms; however, there are some reservations that other reviewers also mentioned.

My 7 and 9 year old girls want to learn guitar.  A full sized guitar is hard for them to manage.  This is more their size.  It does need constant tuning- probably the biggest drawback.  My girls are learning off ""Alfred's Complete Kids' Guitar Course"".  It starts with single finger chords: C-G7-G then a 3 finger chord D7, which are fine on this guitar since it only involves the high 3-4 stings(mostly G-B-E).

For full 6 string strumming, there's usually a string that needs to be tuned or one can just ignore it, and let them strum and play to their imagination.  Our strings have not broken yet.  They have covers for the nuts and stickers to id the open string(which eventually fall off- not a biggie).  It's opening is small and the resonance very limited.

I find our girls use this for play, pretend and simple practice.  For better sound, they mess around with our electric quitar on a mini-amp.  For their age group, it takes time to get use to pressing the strings down and toughen and strenthen their little fingers up.  It's all for fun and they're advancing quite well at their own pace.

Overall, consider the cost and what you want out of a guitar- if it is just fun and goofing around with a little intro to the instrument- this one might suit you; otherwise, buy a better one.",3.0,0

Cons:
- Will not straighten out, not at all, it strongly insists on remaining curly, which makes it far less inconspicuous as it refuses to lie and kinks up
- Pinches your fingers badly, really, really badly.  Seems impossible, I know, but seriously, it hurts.  The plastic they used is just wrong for this application, it's so stiff it I'm typing this on fingers that are raw from having to spread it open to put the cables inside.

"I do like it. It works well. The complaints I have about it are relatively minor:
1) It does use quite a bit of space. To keep the arms from extending beyond the back of my desk (which was important in my particular setting), I had to mount it (drill the hole) almost 12"" in from the back edge of the desk. That places the monitors about 15"" in from the back edge of the desk.
2) Cord management is minimal. The upper of the arms, the cords are simply ""tied under"". The lower of the arms, the cords are held inside by the most complex piece of molded plastic known to man, which must be carefully inserted by a Plastics-Certified Brain Surgeon. I am surprised that they didn't think to allow the cord management to share a hole with the support itself, which would have been handy.
3) It says ""amazon basics"" on a prominent logo right in the middle of the base. I don't need more logos on my stuff, unless you're going to pay me handsomely to display them. (This will work to cover the logo: https://smile.amazon.com/Scotch-Duct-Black-1-88-Inch-60-Yard/dp/B0013AX6FC/)

"This CPU was too fast.

Amazon needs a way to prevent OUIs (ordering under the influence). One morning not long ago I woke up with a terrible hangover, not quite sure what happened the night before. Upon checking my email that morning, I noticed a shipment notification for a Intel Core i7-3930K Hexa-Core Processor. I realized I must have ordered in a drunken blur, and through the haze I indeed remembered placing some kind of order.

I was shocked, but decided to go ahead and let the order go through. After all, I had been debating this purchase for weeks and just didn't want to shell out the dough for this wicked CPU. After all, I told myself, I already had a quad-core 2700k overclocked to 5 GHZ, why would I need the 3930k with six cores and amazing stats?

But it was on the way. The 2700k at 5 GHZ was already a beast, and I found through practice I could reign it in and handle it, so thought I was ready for this 3930k and its hexacore awesomeness... well I was wrong.

To make a long story short, the power of my PC outfit with this CPU literally destroyed my mind. It was far, far beyond my control. I wrestled it for hours in epic battles through various intense games and applications, certain I could reign it in, but in the end it left me a quivering, sweating mass, as blood and drool sprayed forth from me in profuse waves. I don't want to go into the detail of the things I saw while this CPU rendered 12 threads of everything I threw at it at billions of calculations per second, but suffice it to say mortal human minds can't handle it.

In summary, I am sending it back -- it is too fast. I need to give it 5 stars because it is truly amazing. Words of advice: Do not OUI, and do not think other fast CPUs you have used have in any way prepared you for this one -- they have not.",5.0,0

"I am a die hard fan of Gezer!! I purchased a pair of their ""Black Roses"" sandals over a year ago & from the first time I wore them it has been my go to sandal over all! I had this pair on my wish list for awhile, but I had a few polo, guess & Ocean Pacific sandals at the time so I put off buying for a moment....to my total surprise, the Black Roses by Gezer lasted longer than all the sandals I paid much more for...and none of them had a guided foot support or an arch like these do. I live in the southwest & I wear sandals even in the winter, and I walk an insane amount as I am in a personal weight loss program & walking is the kindest to my joints which have issues from my serious athletic days of basketball, performance dance, ballet & cheerleading...so I walk everyday, everywhere  up to 2-3 miles depending on my schedule and Gezer holds up and because of the arch & toes supports they are comfortable the entire time. I also bought another pair of Black Roses because my once chubby foot has shrunk considerably during my weight lose & the leather straps were too big, but still in beautiful condition!! The sole was even barely worn, after a year of almost daily user!!  I passed them onto my niece as she is pregnant & has chubby feet  now (: She put them on & immediately said...""OOOO, these are soo pretty!!

The camera is amazing in every way except for that it has a noticeable shake on the outside edge when shooting in 4k mounted on a tripod. This is a very well known issue with this camera and they claimed to have fixed it with a firmware patch but after applying the firmware the problem still remains. Even when you disable the steady shot feature it still happens so something else is causing the optics to vibrate inside of the camera. Sony has been little help so far with correcting the issue and even claimed the couldn't tell when I sent them a video clearly illustrating the problem.

I was not able to see any difference with the bigger dogs in eating the two kibbles.  Seemed to be all the same.  Point being, it was apparently eaten equally in both cases.

That was not true with our little old dog.  She tore into this new kibble with a vengeance.  After carefully considering the matter I believe its a tad softer and based on oder may be tastier.  In any case, she loves it.

Well if you look below and see Sony's response.... what a lame reply.
I like how the comment is just ""sorry"".....  why wouldn't the organization try to make it right?
Your smart response would have been to say ""email me and I will send you a lens cap"".
Or "" here is what you can buy on Amazon that fits"".
Hey Sony.... now you really blew it....now everyone can see how stinky your ""after purchase"" customer service is.... sheesh, what a joke.

Original Review:
Well I have had this camera for 1.5 years and have to say it takes amazing pictures.
It's a nice step up from some of the other point/shoot brands and it is a perfect size to grab and take with anywhere.
Fits well into small bags, purses etc

Here is my sole complaint but it is huge one.....
There is zero info on the lens size so finding a replacement lens cap.... has been a nightmare...... sigh!!
I wasted tons of time talking to the ""product experts"" at Sony (they're not very bright about their own products) who cannot find the lens size.
Tried a few camera stores and not had any luck finding a replacement cover b/c the lens is not threaded....
That means I have to order one from Sony, pay their ridiculously high price for a new lens cap.
What a ""post-purchase"" drag this has been!
Lesson leaned.... I will stick with other brands now that have more main stream camera parts so a simple thing like buying a replacement lens cap is not a big hassle......
You've lost all my future business on this Sony.....",2.0,0

"I'm a plus size woman (24/26 in pants, 3X in shirts), but only C cup breasts. It's hard to find lingerie that fits the way I want. I'm not one of those comfortable big girls that likes flaunting it or wearing lots of tight things so I definitely wanted something loose. I spent 4 hours browsing multiple sites for plus size lingerie and read every review I could find. I ended up buying this in a 5X because the reviews were mostly consistent with buying 2 sizes up. I was worried it would be too loose on my breasts because of that, but it's not bad. It is a complete halter, so if you want your back covered at all, this isn't for you, but it does fit well if you go 2 sizes up, at least in my case, and the breast coverage seems nearly universal. Theres a lot of material to cover more, but it's tight enough to not be useless on smaller cup sizes. It's obviously not great material, but for this price, you shouldn't expect too much.

"After discovering how harmful rawhide chews, treats, bones etc. I went on a search to find a healthy alternative for my 3 mo. old puppy. I was amazed to find how healthy sweet potato strips and fries were for all dogs as there are no harmful ingredients in them and they contain no other ingredients except sweet potato, period. At first my dog was confused, however offering nothing else but the sweet potato, she quickly decided to give them a try. She takes them to her bed and enjoys them tremendously. Biting off small pieces and chewing each piece thoroughly and completely before swallowing. The bag contains a lot of strips, and lasts a long time.  I will never give my dog any type of rawhide, and my wish is that people would just research how rawhide of any type is processed from beginning to end, and they will discover how harmful if not deadly rawhide is for your beloved pet. Giving sweet potato is 100% natural without any threat to your dog's health, not to mention that they are tasty snack and treat to offer your dog, and it's important to know they are made in the USA, and reading the label for ingredients, you will immediately realize this is the right choice of chew and treat to give your beloved dog.

"I upgraded from the S4i which, despite the ear tip choices, didn't quite fit right. While I can't justify that the high price of the X10i has anything, if any, to do with fit, they DO fit much better. Maybe it's the obtuse, minimalist design as compared to the slight rear bulge of the S4i (not that those were big in the first place). Now I'm able to hear instruments in songs I never heard before!

You'll hear EVERYTHING with these, which can be good or bad, especially if you listen to a song encoded poorly. My mp3s aren't lossless by any means, but the clarity the X10i gives is unparalleled. I was expecting to hear much more hisses and clicks, but surprisingly I haven't (lucky, i guess). It hits all the highs and lows just the way I like them!

I use these mainly while playing my e-drum kit through a Roland TD-9, so its discriminating fidelity is important to me.

If these reviews only focused on the product in-hand, then I would have posted 5 out of 5 stars. IMHO, reviews encompass all that comes with the product, from its accessories to the warranty period. I gave the X10i 4 stars for the following reasons: 1) At such a premium price, why aren't the included airplane and 1/4"" adapters gold just like the headphone's 3.5 mm jack?

"There is only one pro and con to this harness that matters.

HUGE PRO:  My 100+ pound dog is forced to turn around or stop every time he pulls on the leash because it is connected to the front of the harness.  This means less strain for me and my limbs every time we take a walk.  Previously, I used neck collars and harnesses where the leash ring was on my dog's back.  Neither prevented my dog from pulling and the former felt like I was choking him.  I think the latter made him feel like he was in control of the walk and not me.

CON: The harness has to be tightened in the appropriate areas (FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS ATTACHED TO THE HARNESS) or the HUGE PRO mentioned above is not great...effective, but not as effective.

Aside from that, I like the color of the harness and the contrast with the green and black.  Wish they made more harnesses with this color instead of the ugly lime green that seems so prevalent as an option.",4.0,0

"My 5 year old and my 3 year old really enjoyed the DohVinci Deluxe Styler.  They played with it back and forth between them for around an hour. There was a little bit of fighting over who's turn it was so you know they liked using it.

The Play-Doh that comes out of the tubes is not traditional Play-Doh. It's a softer compound making it easy enough for kids to squeeze. The Styler gun is simple to use; the kids didn't need any help changing it out. My 3 year old was able to do it a couple of times, but couldn't after his hands were reportedly ""wet"". I'm not sure if he had been putting his fingers in his or just clammy kid hands. I don't know why, sometimes kids just got clammy hands, they don't know either. Anyway aside from ""wet"" hands the kids were able to completely utilize the DohVinci Styler.

Another point about it not being traditional Play-Doh is that it's not reusable. When you finished with regular Play-Doh the kids clean it up by putting it back in the container it came in for use another day. This DohVinci Play-Doh is a one shot deal. It has to be thought of as more of an Art project medium than regular Play-Doh.",5.0,0

"I am extremely large-busted and was in search of a ""miracle"" bra to solve several problems I have with most bras.

1) My everyday bras with underwire were always poking, chafing and causing a rash.
2) Exercise was difficult since no bra supported me well enough to prevent bounce.
3) I needed a bra to sleep in for extra support but didn't want to buy a ton of bras just for that purpose.

The Fiona bra has come closer than any other I've tried at meeting my needs.  The material is soft and absorbent with no underwire, and yet I feel better supported (for everyday wear) than I did in a Bali underwire bra.  It moves with my body, absorbs sweat, and doesn't chafe or poke me anywhere, so it's very comfortable to sleep in.  It's also supportive enough for low-impact exercise; however, it is NOT supportive enough to prevent bounce while jogging or during other high-impact exercise.  Maybe that's just not a possibility for me and someone a little smaller would have better luck.  I should mention that I'm wearing this bra in size 44DD and that it's actually a little small in the cup area.  Fortunately, it launders well.  I haven't found any change in the bra's size or shape from putting it through my washer and dryer.

One other negative is that the bra looks like a sports bra with wide straps and seams running along the sides.  This is fine except for the fact that it makes it a little difficult to wear the bra under all tops as an everyday bra.  Depending on the cut of the top and the material, either the straps or the seams or both will sometimes show through.  This is annoying but not enough of an issue to make me stop using this bra for daily wear.

Overall, I find the bra to be excellent for my full figure.  Although it's not quite my ""miracle"" bra, I still plan to buy more of these.",4.0,0

"I got this in the August Blockhead Box (a dog subscription box).  I have the ""large"" version and, for the record, my dog is an 83-84 pound Rottweiler who is super destructive.

This lasted my dog longer than a lot of cloth-covered toys (I hesitate to call it ""plush"" because it's not particularly soft and doesn't have stuffing).  As in, like five minutes.  Part of the reason was she had a bit of trouble picking it up, but I'm not blaming that on the toy, I'm blaming it on my dog.  She kept trying to pick it up by the middle, while one of her feet was holding the outside part down...anyway, she did eventually get it up.

My dog has the uncanny ability to find the weak point in any toy.  In this case, it is the embroidered KONG logo.  She started gnawing on that after a few minutes and I did eventually have to take it away because she put a few small holes in it near the logo.  For what it's worth, she did LOVE this toy and was sad to have it taken away, and it held up pretty well to tugging.  Also, although there are squeakers, she really didn't squeak this too much (for once, much to my relief...).

In the end, maybe this is not for the heaviest of chewers, but I have no doubt it would work for some dogs (like my last Rottie, who was very gentle with toys).  The large is appropriate for large breed dogs.  Although my dog is on the small side for a Rottie, I would feel comfortable giving this to a dog 20 or 30 pounds heavier, as well.  I would definitely supervise at first, especially if you know your dog is destructive.",3.0,0

"My 21 month old, 50 pound lab mix needs something to chew on every day. He chews between 30 minutes to one hour daily. Most toys he can destroy in a day or less. This includes the giant ropes! The only chew toys that last are heavy duty Kong toys and these Nylabones. He prefers the nylabones and rarely goes for the Kong toys. I keep two or three different shape and textured nylabones out for him all the time and replace them every 9 to 12 months. That's about how long it takes him to chew it down to about two inches. This regular shaped bone and the wishbone are his favorites over the heavily textured type. I can't tell the difference by smell of the different flavors and he doesn't prefer one flavor over another either. I like these over real bones because he isn't able to chew off a sharp chunk and swallow it. These shred in small bits like sawdust and won't hurt your pet if swallowed.

Pill pocket flavor matters big time here, making the difference between her swallowing meds eagerly versus engaging in repeated  wrestling matches to gag the same pills down her.

She spits subsequent doses out right away -- or she picks at the pocket but leaves the pill behind, which puts us back to the wrestling routine.  I have much more consistent success with getting her to swallow meds eagerly if I consistently use the pea/duck flavor Pill Pockets.

"This watch was a lot bigger and heavier than I'd expected. I have thin wrists. I wear Medium-sized gloves. This watch looks comical on my naked wrist and feels ungainly.

This is not a watch for everyday use. This is for sportsmen, to be strapped atop bulky clothing. The watch feels very strong and rugged, good for rough sports activity. Were I to see a man wearing this watch at a formal function, I'd think he was ""trying too hard"" to impress, wearing such a gaudy (albeit attractive) timepiece.

I've read that watches are declining in sales, because so many people now rely on their smart phones to know the time. Watches are increasingly being used as jewelry, or to make a statement. This watch is certainly eye-catching. But this watch is also useful if you're wrapped in bulky sports clothes, and don't want to fumble for the smart phone in your pocket.

Plus, this watch has a second hand. My smart phone provides no way for me to measure the passing of seconds. So this watch also serves as a stop watch.

My watch came with the WRONG MANUAL. It came in a nice box, with a nice paper manual. But the watch described in the manual is not the one that came in the box. My watch's face and features are entirely different from the diagrams of the watch in the manual. For instance, my watch only has a second hand, not the 1/10 of a second hand pictured in the manual.

"This is just like the V911 and V912 helos.  But bigger.  Significantly bigger.

Lots of purists hate this helicopter. They say its like driving a school bus. EXACTLY. If you're looking for a tiny agile helo to do cool tricks this isn't it. If you're looking for a big-boned helo that sounds awesome, that you can feel the wind from, that you can shred your trees and frighten your animals this is it. You can fly this thing very high and a long way away since you can still sight it due to its size.

Do not get this as your first helo. You need to know how to fly a V911 or V912 size first. This could seriously damage something (or someone) in your yard. Also, while this helo can take a reasonable beating, you'll damage it pretty quick if you don't know how to fly it. Heavier weight equals more damage.

"Pros: Picture quality is still good, Canon has not lost it's touch after ten years of making Elphs.  The size is awesome, I can place it anywhere I'd like.  With a three inch LCD, who needs a view finder - does anyone still use a view finder?  It offers a lot of scene modes and they are not that difficult to get to, it just takes a little time to get used to the buttons.  The 6.0 megapixel and 3x optical zoom and UA lens is all you need.  This Elph now offers a new ISO 800, which reduces image blur and expands low-light shooting ability.  It's camera solution CD-ROM software has improved a lot, so it's easier to download, edit, and view your pictures.

Cons: It's features are a bit basic but it offers just enough for those point and shot customers.  So if you want a lot of manual features you might want to pay more for another camera.  The LCD might get thumbprints very easily but I have one word for you: invisibleSHIELD.  Amazons might sell one for this camera, if not, do a web search.  It doesn't come with a case or bag; the manual is boring and just like all the others - you may need to buy a book if photography is a hobby for you.  The Function/Set buttons might be too small, but I have small hands so I'm cool with their size.

Conclusion: The Canon PowerShot SD630 is an solid ultracompact camera, with performance and photo quality that more than make up for its few design flaws and it's price. It's a good shooter, and its feature set makes it quite flexible for a camera of its size. That said, it's basically a more expensive version of the PowerShot SD600 with a larger screen and no optical viewfinder.",5.0,0

Though I didn't need it this time, the rubbing alcohol trick totally works.) I expected these to be tight, but they're not. My calves are about 14.5 inches, and the boots do fit over my leggings or jeans, but with NO room to spare. Keep that in mind if you have large calves. (I noticed that Timberland is now making this type of boot with an elastic inset in the shaft for wider calves. I don't think they are nearly as cute, though.) This boot is GORGEOUS. The leather is such a great color (tobacco) and it looks even prettier now that I've used mink oil on it. I can't wait for Fall so I can wear these boots all the time. They seem to be very well made, very expensive looking. I have short legs, so I love that they stop a few inches below the knee. If they were any taller, I think they'd look like they were wearing me, instead of the other way around. These are absolutely lovely. So many tall boots look cheap or gaudy to me, but these are wonderful. They are so comfortable already, and I know they will only get better. I got a great deal, too, but If I'd known how much I'd love them I would have paid full price 2 years ago!",5.0,0

"I have always used weewee pads for my Chihuahua - vet's suggestion.  I have never had to  care about how thick or deodorized they were.  Every one works fine; so to me the cheapest is best since my dog uses one per week or two.

If you have a big dog or pony these might not be so good.  But who needs a peewee pad for a big dog/pony anyway?

Hint: these peewee pads come with 2 folds, one  in the front and one in the back.  Fold  front or back side under. Invariably, your pet will place its front paws on the pad and pee slightly behind it.  The folded-under part will collect the miss.  After a few days, reverse the pad and fold the other edge under.  Discard  the pad when it becomes intolerable to you, but remember dogs are drawn to scents; so pristine pads are not a magnet, whatever the age of the dog.",5.0,0

"I own a bunch of CK dress shirts and know the brand for making quality shirts that hold up to years of use. This shirt seems like no exception to that rule but I was a bit surprised to find that the fit is a bit tight. So buyer beware, if you're normally a size large then you may want to scale up one size to an XL.

I tend to dress a bit more casually to work and usually just throw on a sport jacket, shirt and slacks. I rarely go with a tie unless there's a reason to. So for my purposes I think this shirt will work out very nicely. I think 95% of the shirts I own are blue or have blue in them so it'll fit right in with the rest of my wardrobe.

I was also pleased to find that this shirt is lightweight and does not feel like a heavy cotton shirt. That will definitely be appreciated in the hot, muggy Midwest summer.

I would classify this as a modern shirt with a lightweight construction, buttons (instead of french cuff) all around, small collar, slim fit, and less shirt material (tail). Overall I'm quite pleased with the shirt but I'd probably go a size up if ordering another.",4.0,0

"I purchased this doll for my 2 year old daughter to help her transition into being a big sister.  I plan on wearing it in a sling occasionally and making a little sling for her as well so she can carry it.  It's a great size for her.  While the mouth isn't really open for feeding, the lips are parted enough that she can sort of pretend to bottle feed it.  It's not super soft plastic and so the legs and arms are pretty stiff and solid.  The eyes remain open, which is kind of a bummer.  My daughter is not big into dolls, so I just try to mention it now and then and get her to rock it or feed it.

I'm really not a fan of the smell.  I think it's too strong.  I like that they used phalate-free plastic, but I'm still not sure I want it sharing my daughter's bath because of all the fragrance they use.  It's a weird vanilla smell. I did my research though and pretty much all these types of newborn dolls have this baked-in smell (the nice ones that is).  I'm sure you can get one from a toy store that is cheap and scentless, but I really wanted the safer plastic (not that any plastic is that great).

Miniland has a website and they have several more dolls of different sizes.  They have different ethnicities, which is great because I can get different ones as my daughter gets older- if she ends up liking dolls.  They are very well made and a nice quality.

"The leg holes were a bit small for my 8mo who is big for his age (21lbs / 28 inches) in comparison to the body hole which is twice his size. The result is that baby was nervous wobbling back and forth in the beginning. Once we showed the baby to lean forward, he seemed to take it better and wasn't as scared. Making the leg holes even 1 inch bigger would be great, and make the body hole 4 inches smaller in circumference would balance this out better.
For direct overhead shade, this shade stands up but wobbles. Perhaps an extra snap button loop towards the front and next to the existing ones would give it more stability. Overall, for the price, durability, and value. We are happy. Also nice to have something baby that is NOT so bulky while porting everything else around.",5.0,0

As it gets around 70%, besides the performance issues, sort issues, there is a much grater chance of database and OS, issues, because of the needing of large work areas, that are not available.

"After reading many pet water fountain reviews, I bought this fountain as a solution to my cats constantly drinking out of the toilet.  I have water that I change in 2 large ceramic dog bowls twice a day in different locations, one by their kibble dish and one upstairs.  They still use all the options but drink out of the fountain enough so that I have to add between a pint and a quart of water each day.

I have 2 long-haired cats and 2 short-haired, all under a year old.  The fountain has not clogged from all the hair!  It's great that it has a filter.  I clean it  every week or 2 by hand.  It's simple to clean, no need to use a dishwasher.  I place the top part on the floor and take the bottom part to the kitchen to wash, and vice versa.  The cats have to check out the empty fountain and watch while I refill it.

It was easy to set up.  Once I figured out that the hose from the pump needs to go into the opening in the top part of the fountain, there was nice water movement.

I didn't find a specific mat to go under it, but I have it in a place where there is tile so it doesn't matter if water splashes out.  If anyone knows what mat works best with this, please add that to your review.

I have it in the living room and I think location is important.  There's a lot of activity in that room and they prefer being where the action is.  And now part of the action is drinking water from the fountain.  It's on the floor near a scratching post and near the cat door.

"I love this stand. I bought it so that I could set up my iPad to use for my guestbook at my wedding and it worked wonderfully. It was sturdy but still easy to adjust for my non-tech-savvy relatives. The only downside (and this is not related to the product) is that I bought it as an warehouse deal which said ""minor cosmetic damage possible"" but instead it was missing a whole piece. There are supposed to be little foam stickers for the corners that help keep it gripped, but it works fine without them so I just went with it.

"Have now tried this product on 5 different cats.  Two gobbled them down with tablet inside.  One would only eat if tablet was crushed, but did so readily after crushed and bits/powder hidden in pocket.  One cat just sniffed around it and walked off, but next day tried BEFORE feeding her anything all day - IT worked.  One cat sniffed and ran regardless of what I tried.

CATS ... what can you say other than that?

At least they worked (with some additional trickery) on 4 out of 5.  And not having to brave the claws and sharp teeth when trying to stuff a tablet or capsule in mouth of 4 out of 5 is EXCELLENT !!

Very easy to use, but a bit ""greasy"".  So much easier than trying to force pill down their mouth or chopping up and carefully slicing center of hotdog to hide pill in it, and probably a lot healthier for them  (and me!).  Think I may try the salmon flavor on other cat, can't hurt to try, if she doesn't like, the other cats may and at ~$6.00 no big investment.",5.0,0

"On the one hand, this one is a ""designer"" teddy bear, complete with Swarovski eyes, nose, silver heart and silver banner; on the other hand, it's the softest bear you'd ever lay your hands on if the recipient allowed it.

But my 3-year-old grand-daughter had other things in mind than watching historical, or history-making, movies.  This Care Bear proved the right companion to get her to bed and end her pestering us for more presents.

"I have many different sets of scrubs. I do not wear them professionally, I just wear them as pajamas and lounge wear around the house because they are so comfortable and they look a bit better than sitting around in pjs. I am always looking for new sets to add into my collection, and when I saw the MediFit Men's Basic Solid 2 Piece Top and Bottom Scrub Uniform Set, I jumped at the chance to order a set.

MediFit is one of my favorite brands for scrubs. Their quality is high and their pricing is generally lower than other brands. This set was just as good as all of the other MediFit scrubs that I have purchased. The fabric is soft and comfortable against my skin. It is made from 80% Polyester and 20% Tetron Rayon, and it is highly absorbent and wrinkle resistant, which are both definite bonuses! The fabric is also quite breathable and feels light and airy. It would be ideal for someone rushing back and forth in a hospital or doctor's office.

This set of scrubs is very roomy and it has a flattering v-neckline. The top has a roomy patch pocket, and the pants have two slash pockets, and two cargo pockets, so there is plenty of pocket space for me! The waist is drawstring, which means it can fit a pretty wide range of sizes, and the pant legs are a standard straight leg fit. The scrubs have a nice classic design, which I appreciate. I am pleased with their quality and appearance.

I must disclose that this product was received at a discounted cost for my honest and unbiased review. My opinion was not altered due to the product being discounted.

"This case is the perfect companion for your Minecraft minis!!  The compartments are actually big enough that you can get two into most of them to double its effective storage.

It folds together into a block (nice touch) and has a very good latching mechanism that blends well with the case design.  You could also store a few into the play area of the case when you close it up.  While not very large, when the case opens up there is a play area on the back with several blocks painted to resemble various ores.  A nice little touch.

"I have owned this camera for 4 years now.

Pros - Beautiful landscapes.
  Amazing outdoor shots and colors
  Easy to carry. Good response time. Good video too.
I have made a few trips, shot photos/videos at a couple of marriages and the comments on my landscape shots have generally been 'which camera do you have? Wooh that's costly for a non-SLR camera but the landscape shots are surely good.'

Cons- Indoor shots suck big time, flash power is too weak. I used a extra flash which had multiple levels but the light level indoors would either come too bright or weak and it would be just right only a few times.

I had bought it for around 600+ dollars(including the cost of accessories) when it had come out and was impressed by its build quality. It really looks cool and compact. But it turns out the prices of compactness is paid in the life of the camera. Since the lens retracts back and out it has a good chance of getting damaged. It looks like some sensors(battery/door/lens sensors) have got damaged.

That moving part stopped working a few weeks back. It does not start up and the repair cost will be at least half the cost of a good new camera. I have film cameras bought buy my dad's uncle at a yard sale in the 1950s that still work fine. I was expecting this camera to last me for at least 10 years. I am very disappointed that it has become unusable in 4 years.

I would have loved to give this camera at least 4 stars but wanted to give it only 1 for not being durable. Finally I am giving it 2 for at least good 4 years of service. They don't make them like they used to anymore. Will be trying a Nikon next.",2.0,0

"The stated dimensions on the description are overstated in the usable space of the bag. I find the outside of the bag alone are 7.5 x 6.75 x 3. That being said the bag is still large enough for most anything you need in a hurry. Definitely enough for a very comprehensive first aid kit. I use mine for a possible bag instead. It has metal D rings attached to the back that hold a shoulder strap and enough organization room inside for all your essentials. There is enough webbing on the outside to mount any extra things you might need. Mine holds an extra knife and tomahawk. I have the platform mounted to my hunting ruck or go pack then I just peel the bag off, deploy the shoulder strap, and I am off. The zippers are nice mid duty and covered. Covered enough to ward off dust and debris and light water. Dont get me wrong it is nowhere near waterproof but the covering adds some resistance. The mounting platform comes with retaining straps to secure the bag from accidental loss if the Velcro should fail. All the webbing on the inside of the bag is elastic minus the retaining strap for the pockets allowing you to secure your load without having it rattle around. Overall very nice bag.

"We purchase these cute little shoes for our little son and since he is a boy we chose this navy blue and white combination for him.  It looked so cute in the picture here online and when we got these on hand, it exactly looked like the photo.  We started examining it inside and outside and found it to be a very nice quality pair of shoes.  The texture of these shoes are soft but the material is not thin at all, thus it does provide your little one the needed protection for his feet when he starts walking or jumping with these shoes.  We have a bouncer at home which my son is absolutely much into.  He loved it so much but we noticed that he is using the tip of his toes when bouncing and my mom told us that we should be putting on shoes on him when he does bounce in the bouncer.  We used these pair of shoes and it helped a lot.  He is still getting used with it but we could see that he is happy with it.  We have not seen any signs of discomfort on his part upon wearing these shoes.  We removed the tassels as we do find it unnecessary.  It is a cute design though.  Anyway, overall, this is a very worthy purchase.  It actually has a bit of room for his feet to grow into which is nice for it means that he will be able to use these for a longer period of time.

"There are many options out there for small aquariums.  So many questions.  Glass or acrylic... tall and skinny or short and long.... what kind of filter....  As a prior aquarium owner of both fresh and salt, starting with a 10 gal and working my way up to a 75, I have some experience with tanks and took a 10-year hiatus.  In 2010, my young son won a gold fish at the local state fair (imagine my dismay - a GOLDfish?  A dirty bottom feeder? ugh - haha).  We purchased a small 1-gal tank and needed to move up when this fish continued to grow and thrive!  We purchased this Eclipse tank because it was seamless (so I didn't need to worry about leaks on the dresser) and we liked the domed-front which actually makes the tank appear bigger than it is.  I have seen comments that some people don't like having to take the entire top off to maintain the tank, however, if you are going to see this tank from the TOP (which you will on a desktop or dresser), I cannot express how ***absolutely amazing*** it is to have one smooth top versus a hood with a filter sticking out of the back.  The tank is quiet and stays very clean, even with our two enormous goldfish.  We do a 25% water change every 5-6 weeks and rinse the filter cartridge out about every 2-3 weeks (or whenever needed).  Goldie and Diego are so huge now that we are looking for a bigger tank (again).  I've been out there looking (since there are 10 gal setups available for less than the Eclipse system - even an LED one from Marineland), however, we have decided to purchase the 12 gal Eclipse system - largely because of the fully enclosed top.  This is an excellent looking tank and I recommend it highly.",5.0,0

We have bought Melissa & Doug products in the past and they are very well made and I would highly recommend them to anyone.

"These boots were a gift for my wife. When she first put them on they seemed a little small. I do recommend ordering a size larger than your regular shoe size. That is your boot size.
She has been wearing them for a week and they have loosened a slight bit. She doesn't mind the snug fit, because they are faux fur lined and she doesn't wear socks with them anyway. They are mostly to pull on quickly for going out of the house to check the mail, take out the dogs, etc.
They are warm and cozy and are exactly what I hoped they would be.",5.0,0

"I bought one of these in large to try it out. The label was ""Urban Crews"". After washing it shrunk a little but was not a bad t-shirt for exercise (I like the extra length for stretching (no stomach shows)). I ordered another 2 shirts in XL Only ONE of the two were delivered. The label now said ""FWRD Denim Company"". It is a totally different type of material. Much cheaper and the make is also very cheap (not inexpensive...CHEAP).
So it appears the quality of the shirt you get is VERY haphazard. Is it Urban Crews or some place they farmed it out to.
The FWRD Denim Company shirt is made in Pakistan. It says it is 100% cotton just like the Urban Crew shirt but it does not absorb sweat like cotton. It just drips off like synthetic.
I would NOT recommend these. You have no idea what you will get. I'm going to try a Duluth Trading Company long tail tee. They are $19.50, made in USA and much better quality.",1.0,0
"The Project Mc2 Soda Pop Science Kit comes with a kit to make your own fizzy soda.

You can make:

Lime Soda
Cinnamon Soda (didnt taste this!)
Fruit Punch

Kit includes:
Critic Acid
Baking Soda
Flavor packages
Test Tubes
Stand for the test tubes
Measuring Scoops
Instruction Booklet

This is a fun kit for kids. They market the MC2 line to promote science to girls and I appreciate that. I don't know if I was that hip on making soda - but we gave it a try.

The instructions are easy to follow, you add a few ingredients and make a drink. It really wasn't that hard. It was cool that you could have these things lying around and make your own later and they get the concept of household DIY stuff - that would normally be packaged and sold.

Overall, this was a basic science toy and for about the age range of 8 years of age.",4.0,0

An eight year old could easily complete the project without assistance and older girls, over twelve or so, will likely become bored with it or complete the project very quickly. What I like most about the kit is that it doesn't involve glue or anything messy. It's something that can be completed on a car trip.",5.0,0

"This is a very dense bone that is 5.5 inches long by about 2 inches wide.  My 80 lb greyhound loves it.  It's almost too big for him.  I do think it cleans his teeth because he has to work so hard gnawing at it to get even the tiniest chunk to come off the end.  He only gets through about half of this bone before he's full and tired.  Then I remove it and save it for the next day.  The 4 stars are because it's messy.

"Purchased this light for my high-tech planted tank before really doing much research. After using the light for a few weeks I've come to realize that it's not enough light for ""high-light"" plants. This model only puts out 20W which means that for a 20g tank you're still only getting 1W/gallon. CurrentUSA also claims a PAR reading of 100 in the center from 12"" above. Every single third-party test I've seen and read refutes this claim. The most I've seen from independent tests is about 65-70 PAR in ideal conditions. Not bad, but definitely not an honest description by CurrentUSA.

One other thing I really dislike about this light is the controller (the brains of the hardware). I really wish they would have integrated the controller into the housing unit of the light because it seems to always fall off my table and whenever I pick it up the buttons are so sensitive that one slight touch the lights will come on full blast in the middle of the night and startle my fish. The 24/7 feature is kind of nice and so is the dawn/dusk feature. I could have done without the gimmicky settings such as cloudy and lightning storm.

At the end of the day I ended up buying two units in order to get the PAR values that I needed for my tank. If you decide to do something similar just keep in mind that you cannot pair two units with one controller however you can use the same remote to control the two separate controllers. Overall  if you are looking for a low to mid light for around $100 (not sure why anyone would) then you may want to consider this light.",3.0,0

"I bought this dog door 8 months ago and am on my fourth collar (for two dogs).  They are fragile and not designed well.  I don't know why they have the battery indicator light as the light works well past when the battery has enough juice to power the door signal, as far as I can tell.  When you open the case, the button often falls right out.

If you have two dogs, both have to have the water-resistant transmitter or both the non, because they have different signal strengths so one dog will be opening the door from 10' away while one will have to be right in front of it.

To get around having the silly second collar on the dog, I use the flimsy nylon strap to tie the transmitter to their real collar.  I like the zip tie idea better.

"I bought this because my son was given a similar track system made by a competitor and loved it for the short time it functioned (hand-me-down gift).  However, all the vehicles were broken or lost besides the one I managed to rig up for a while.  I set out to find replacement cars and could not.  So buying this was the next best thing.

Let me tell you...my son absolutely loves this set.  In fact, he didn't stop playing with it for the entire first day he had it.  It seems well-made taking the price into account.  The track length is actually perfect considering I use the other one simultaneously. The cars have a lot of ""get up and go"", as well.

I am most impressed with the inclusion of extra parts.  I'd read reviews on Amazon before purchasing this set that complained about issues with the tire treads...When I opened the box, I found several replacement treads among other extras.  The track is easy for me to assemble and dis-assemble, but not for my two year old.

The set I received actually had a few additional parts to the track not shown in the picture, which adds to the fun!

I'm worried about the cars being damaged because my son is a bit rough with them and there seems to be no way to replace just the vehicles if this does happen. So that annoys me, but overall I'm very pleased with this purchase and my son didn't stop smiling...My 9-year-old god son likes it, as well!!",5.0,0

-Chrip, not there yet. It actually corrupts several of the channel settings when I push this to the radio. This may change in the future, but with the latest (as of Dec. 1 2014) daily release...not there yet.
- The Wouxen software, not good. Its better than the Baofeng software, but I still find it challenging to move memory slots around.

Also, I want to include in memory several law enforcement frequencies, WX and PUD frequencies, but there is no way that I can see to disable TX? Whats up with that? On other radios, I can add frequencies to my channel memories, but I can disable TX for those. On the KG-U8D I see no way to do this. So I only hope that my kids don't get a hold of the radio and key down on those channels. I can disable TX on any other radio I own including the cheap UV-5R's; So I was really disappointed to see this.

"These JBL Stereo Headphones (ear buds, really) have brought music back to my ears.  Since losing most of the hearing in one ear (and about 20% in the other), my experience of music was drastically altered.  Stereo became an aberrant mono, movement became stuck in place, and range became unpleasantly narrow.  Amazingly, these headphones compensate for much of that, and music sounds rich and clean once more.  I cannot explain the acoustics that make this happen, but I am thoroughly surprised by and appreciative of it.  (The first music I listened to was a pre-hearing loss favorite  Van Morrisons Poetic Champions Compose.  The alto and soprano saxophones have reclaimed their divinity.)  The rated frequency response is 10  22K hertz.  The buds are comfortable and fit securely; I did not need to use the optional silicone tips.

It's a nice looking shirt, but not for a 38D. The only negative thing is the material is very stretchy. The fabric is very thin and it would be more comfortable if it were stretchy.

"I bought this antenna originally because in my apartment I didn't have straight shot to the southern sky, so I thought buying this and placing it near or outside my window it would work fine.  Well, to say the least, that didn't work out as planned.  I could barely find reception, but I can't blame it for not working in that situation I guess it wasn't intended to do such magic.

"Our Weimaraner was having some trouble with urine leakage.  She wasn't an older dog and occasionally she would urinate while sleeping.  We wanted to try a more holistic approach.  She did not have an infection.  We discovered it was not all that uncommon for female dogs to develp some urinary tract and bladder weaknesses after they are spayed.

We noticed a change in her in about three weeks.  She stopped having accidents and leaks.  She loves to chew the tablets.  They are liver flavored so she thinks they are a treat. When she ran out of them for a few weeks, we noticed she started to have some leakage problems again, so we put her back on the product and so far no problems.  We saw no side effects either.",5.0,0

"Use With Care! This product worked wonders on the hair algae I couldn't get rid of. I tried everything first. I moved my tank away from sunlight. Changed to a lower light source. Set my lights on a timer. Sprayed things down with 3% hydrogen peroxide. Cleaned hard items in Clorox and then soaked in anti-chlorine water. Boiled my gravel. I mean I tried EVERY THING! I tried AgaeFix, but it caused my harlequin rasbora tetras great distress. I finally purchased this. I cleaned my tank very well with a 75% water change. I did the dosage of 1 drop per gallon. The tetras and Cory catfish took it well. My live plants looked fine. In fact I completed the 3 days of dosage with no trouble. My tank never developed algae after this for a month. The sand, rocks, plants, glass look great! Wow!!! So here is the caution. I believe from what I read that the chemical can lower the oxygen level in the water, the first time cleaning my tank for maintenance, I thought I would do this again-as a preventative. My tetras on the third day are clearly distressed again. From what I read if you see your fish gulping at the top of the water, they may not be getting enough oxygen. Mine were not this time, but I have two very busy air stones and a good filter system in my 20 gal tank. My small goldfish in my five gal did not do so well, and died. I think the were not able to tolerate this stuff. So, this is what I think. If you have tried everything else, try it. Use it when you really need to get the algae under control. If you have not used it before on a particular type of fish, go slow, and maybe try half the dosage. More is not always better.",4.0,0

"Very disappointed in this vx-981K. I had hoped to be able to do a 4k photo burst capture-the menus in the unit are difficult to navigate and understand. The manual is awful, and can't find anything on the website to help. Very misleading as to what this can do. No remote port, so you can't film a show without holding your arm up high on the zoom rocker. I had wanted to mount this on a camera boom arm-but no way to remote control it. I am going to try the Lumix G7 camera, as it has 4K photo burst capture-easy access. And it does have a remote port! When I did film, picture was over-exposed. Not sure if factory set it up this way. Anyway, the build quality seems suspect-SD card slot is underneath unit-can't change it when mounted to tripod! I wish Panasonic would make how-to videos showing all aspects of this video cameras use, instead of 2 minute promo vids with nice music. Even Youtube has mostly unboxing vids. I have used Canon G@0's for years, and Sony products as well, all have remote ports. Not sure why this new trend-maybe using smartphones to control it remotely? Hope this helps.",2.0,0

"I have an Android phone (HTC Evo 3D) and tablet (Nexus 7). The headset works near perfectly on my phone. My issue is that I found that the headset won't work the Netflix app, and I suspect there will be other apps as well that aren't compatible.  For example, all the controls work great with Pandora, Stitcher and YouTube, but the pause/play doesn't work with Netflix. Oddly, the headset doesn't work as seamlessly with the Nexus 7. I'm sitting right next to the tablet and the sound sporadically cuts in and out.

Now on to the good things.  The sound is pretty good, so far nobody has pointed out to me that I must be on a Bluetooth! That is awesome, usually the person on the other end can tell that you're wireless.  The distance is good as well. I like that I can walk 20 feet away and it's still connected. I plan on trying a further distance soon.  I also like the volume level. I'm glad that it can go very loud if needed.  The battery life is pretty decent.  I had to charge it after a day and a half of heavy usage. I also noticed that after my second day or wearing it, I often forget it's there. It's not heavy and you get used to it being there really fast.

Other than the few issue I pointed out, I have no other complaints. It works well with my phone and that's most important to me.  It's a good headset at a good price.

As I use the headset longer, if I find more Apps that it won't work with, I'll come back and update my review.",4.0,0

"We own this bone and went to buy a second one. When I saw it only had 3.5 stars on Amazon, I felt compelled to write a review.

This bone is great. We fill it with peanut butter and freeze it every day for my 40 lb pit bull before he goes in crate.
(1) Very durable. My dog has chewed on it every day for the past 3 weeks and there are no dents in it.
(2) I prefer the glossier material of the Bionic Bone over the more rubbery Kong. The Bionic Bone feels less gross when you pick it up wet.
(3) The Bionic Bone is easy to fill with peanut butter because both sides have holes in them, and it is hollow all the way through. The holes fit the shape of a butter knife well and it is easy to scrape PB off the knife while loading it in.
(4) For the same reasons, it is easier to clean than a Kong (PB tends to get stuck deep in Kongs).
(5) I think that it is better shaped to fit a dog's mouth than the hole of a Kong - my last dog would lose interest in the Kong because he could not reach all PB stuck inside. The Bionic bone is the perfect combination of challenging while not frustrating.

(Sorry Kong - not trying to pick on you.) In conclusion, this is a great product and we are buying a second one.",5.0,0

"Pretty silly cat toy, silly as in pointless. Concept is great, so I listened to the 5 star reviews and asked for this as a gift. From the minute I pressed the power button and the thing started moving, I knew it would be a huge disappointment. It makes an annoying sound, but the worst part is that the laser movement is super rigid and not natural at all. It basically just moves back and forth along in a circular pattern. You can make this pattern large or small, but it otherwise does not change. I'm also not even sure why they provide a ""manual"" mode, as that's no different than a normal small laser pointer, except instead you're holding a gigantic bowling pin and feeling a bit like an idiot. :P Needless to say, my cats also thought this toy was useless. My super playful kitten (loooooves chasing the ""red dot""), tried to chase it for a minute or two, but after a while got bored with the movement and just abandoned the thing.",1.0,0

Since this isn't spec'd for the Paperwhite, it doesn't fit in those tabs, so it can slide around.

"Let me say up front that I bought the 76cs almost exclusively for marine navigation. It is a great little GPS for that purpose and I'm sure it's equally good for hiking. There are a lot better choices for auto navigation but I'm totally happy with it for my purpose. I was initially quite skeptical that a handheld's small screen real estate could be useful as a chart plotter. Nonetheless, I purchased and installed the Blue Chart Americas CD and activated the Caribbean charts. After 2 weeks of constant use sailing in the Windward Islands, I'm astounded at how well it works. With the 'declutter' mode engaged, the screens show an appropriate level of detail and the display has excellent visibility in direct sun. Although the backlight is adequate for viewing in bright conditions under a boat's bimini, I found that I actually preferred to hold it out in the direct sunlight. I particularly like the ability to customize the paging sequence and the autozoom feature is handy as well. There is nothing intuitive about the interface but after I got over the learning curve, I was surprised how quickly I could get to the info I needed. Entering lat/lon waypoints is never going to be fun without a keyboard, but is certainly manageable. If you plan ahead, you can enter them on a PC and download them. A storage card slot would be nice but the entire Caribbean chart set used less than 1/4 of the available memory and on the plus side the unit really is waterproof. The battery life is about as advertised and you can really stretch it by turning it off and on as you need it because it gets a fix in about 15 seconds if you haven't moved too far.",4.0,0
"Installed no problem. REMEMBER it is 3.5 NOT 5.2, so it won't fit in a standard drive bay. (like a cd drive bay)

Gave it two stars because my CF card slot is broken. Cant even put a CF card in it. Fortunately I cant see myself NEEDING it, but that still makes this defective.

Not gonna return it because I don't really need the CF slot.

"My fiancee was nice enough to buy me an aquarium for two years ago, complete with filters, cartridges, submersible heater, air pump, etc. I received an Aqueon QuietFlow Filter with my gift, and knowing nothing much about the types of filters that existed, I thought it was fantastic. Now, a little over two years later I know a lot more about fishkeeping and supplies, and I still think my Aqueon is a great HOB filter. It works on my tank alongside an AquaClear 50 gal filter, and the setup more than meets my expectations.

The filter cartridges, however, are terribly expensive. The only ""LFS"" (if you can even call it that) in my area is a PetSmart, and while I try to avoid that store, I have two cats, so I'm there more than I'd like to be. Eventually I wander to the fish section, and I surrender my wallet and its contents to the cashier. This same 12-Pack of cartridges at the store is around $42. I get the same exact thing on Amazon for a little over $20, with tax added. I rarely spend less than $35 on this crazy site, so I usually get free shipping, so that's another expense I am not accounting for.

I get six more filters online for the same price it costs me to get a 6-pack at the store. Crazy!
I think they work very well for the price, and for being just a standard filter cartridge. They're nothing fancy, but I'm satisfied with how they work. I would, and have, recommended this product to friends.",5.0,0

"seSo I've owned this about a month. I was so impressed by the specs when placed next to the cost it was an easy win. I was concerned ONLY about the issue regarding the hinge but as just about every laptop has a downside I thought I'd risk it. Well I'm feeling pretty bad about this because though the price seems good for the specs a $1200 laptop is not budget and the three things I depend on every time I turn on the unit is DISPLAY, TRACKPAD AND KEYBOARD. Keyboard is a biggie for me and I give it a favourable rating. Trackpad is giving me hell. I had a great time with the synaptics software on my the lenovo I traded this in for. But the software that supports this trackpad is oversenstive. Cursor flies all over the place doing all kinds of madness while I'm typing. Constantly stopping to undo what it has done. Not a soul at ASus has replied to that query. Display was NEVER  a feature I spend alot of time on before because displays just did what displays should do but this yellow tint on the unit that so many other complain of that I didn't realise before makes my eyes hurt.

"I received a defective unit (zoom lens stopped working after an hour), and have had the replacement since December, 2015.  So far, everything is working as of February 7, 2016.  The design and features of this camera are impressive.  There are so many functions and modes that it would be hard to learn all of them, but the layout and menu are such that it is easy to access the features you will need and use, and there are 5 buttons that can be programmed to access your most used menu features.  The only ""cons"" I would mention are:
(1) There is a slight motor noise present as soon as the camera is turned on.  Panasonic says this is normal and needed to support the Image Stabilization, Focus and Zoom functions, but this noise is picked up by the built-in stereo mike during video recording modes.  I wonder about the life of a motor that's on all the time.

It did happen - in the middle of Hollywood.

He was freaked out by a noise, was spinning in circles, slipped out and ran away - ran around a huge block, me in futile pursuit (he runs like a greyhound,) crossed 2 busy streets twice (Yucca and Wilcox) and almost went to Hollywood Blvd. Somehow he survived and this story has a true Hollywood ending... apparently a taxi driver had just let out a fare and my little guy jumped in - only way he could've gone in was on his own. Driver waved me up the street, ""He's here!"" Pointed to his yellow mini-van/taxi. I thought he meant he was hiding underneath - no, he was locked in the back seat.

I had 2 large dogs for over a decade, always had them on either a choker or a secure harness, to avoid my greatest fear of them getting loose. Never happened, they both passed away recently within 6 months of each other. Found this little guy in between, almost lost him because of this harness. Yes - it was on snug.

"If you're a parent/grandparent with a youngster just discovering the ""Cars"" movies, I can tell you that my husband and I have had a blast collecting these small, 1:55 scale Mattel models for our grandsons.  You definitely need a strategy if you plan to collect, since their are just SO many of them.  Hard enough trying to just figure out who all of the characters are!

Giuseppi Motorosi is the Italian-speaking pit crew chief for Lightning McQueen's primary rival, Francesco Bernoulli, in the Cars 2 sequel, both of them sporting the colors of the Italian flag, and they were actually sold together in a 2-pack last year (if you're just starting to collect, might want to check the 2-pack out in case it saves you.)  According to the cute little bios they put out on the characters, Giuseppi is designed as a 1966/69 Alpha Romeo Duetto, a former racer himself until he had a major accident at the Autodromo Nazionale Monza race track on the Curva Parabolica (the final challenge of the race), and has now teamed up with Formula Race champ Francesco.  This - as with all of these little models - is very durable and nicely detailed... just be careful - if you get one of the crew chiefs, your youngster's bound to want them all!

This year Giuseppi is part of the 9-piece WGP Pit Crew collection, along with Alex Machino, Max Schnell's pitty (be careful about adding the racers' little forklift pitty characters too... there's a bunch of them!), Otto Bonn, Austin Littleton, and 2-packs of Manual Maniez/Bruno Motoreau and Jeff Gorvette's Pitty/John Lassetire.",4.0,0

"UPDATE #2: As promised, the vendor sent a replacement headset, which does seem to work better. I was also surprised to find this one fits better too as I did NOT expect that. The original headset seems to be too springy (not really a great way to describe it, but the best words I can come up with at the moment), so it is constantly pulling at my ears and coming loose even with slight movement. This one seems to a little loser, so it is more forgiving of head movement. SO, headset #2 seems to have addressed my two biggest complaints about the headset, so I am happy to upgrade the rating to 4 stars instead of the original 1 star rate. Kudos to Patozon for taking the time to make things right!

UPDATE: The vendor has reached out to me after this review and they are sending me a replacement headset which I think is awesome. I have bumped this up to a two stat based on the customer service. Once I get the headset, assuming there is improvement in their performance, maybe I can bump it up even higher.

I am surprised this headset is so highly rated. I find them to not fit very well and they are constantly falling out of my ears even with the proper ear piece size. That alone would not justify the 1 star rating, but combined with the low sound quality and awful Bluetooth connection, this headset is a huge disappointment. Using a Samsung Galaxy S6, any audio streamed to this device is choppy, in many cases beyond comprehension, unless the phone is about 2 inches from the heaset; even then, sometimes it still doesn't work. I do not have this same issue with other Bluetooth devices paired to this phone. Given the primary function of a headset is to play audio and the fact that this headset doesn't seem to be able to do so warrants a 1 star rating. Wish I knew why some many others have a different experience with this product.",4.0,0

The main mechanic of the game is chucking dice, in a very similar way to King of Tokyo.  4 stars because some character cards have more of an impact than others.  Also, we found that with 6 players, it is hard for the Sheriff/Deputy to win.  Outlaws almost always win (just because 3/6 of the players are Outlaws).

I recommend this game, but only if you don't like other games that fill this particular itch better.  I'm talking about a light game, easy rules, can hold a lot of people, hidden roles, and low downtime between turns.  There are other games that I think can fill this void better, such as One Night Ultimate Werewolf, or The Resistance, just to name a couple.  But if those games aren't for you, this game can be the filler for your group.  You will have fun playing it, but I think most people would prefer the games previously mentioned, especially if we're sticking to the hidden roles action mechanic in a game.

7/10 would recommend.",4.0,0
"Very lacking to say the least. This was one of our special fav books by Dr Seuss for sure..

This game does need to work together, flexibility, and ability for shapes colors and etc.. Its kinda unique compared to other games for sure but i also agree it falls short and doesnt fit the ages that it says it should! It was kinda flimsy made too... things just you kinda want umph a little bit more better etc.",2.0,0

"This is my favorite sandal.  The wide width makes it a nice fit for a person with a narrow foot.  The front of the sandal is a bit wide, but it's still comfortable.

"HALO is a major franchise, a known world populated with a diverse group of races.
Mega Bloks is doing HALO right providing an excellent selection of races and their vehicles in well thought out kits.

"These are adorable shoes and they fit well. My daughter is 6 months and I bought the 0-6 months size because Robeez tend to run large. She has some space to grow, so I anticipate they'll fit her for some time yet--hopefully until the summer at least. There is about a fingertip of space towards the toe. The flower strap does not open, but stretches to accommodate the foot, and I anticipate these will stay on just as well as her Robeez boots. I've tried buying Robeez knockoffs (the ones at Target) and they never stay on or don't fit right, whereas these fit great and are wonderfully constructed. The only real disappointment is that they are made in China. I am always somewhat concerned about quality control with regard to goods coming out of China, but it's very difficult to avoid such products.

"Remember when Coca-Cola stupidly decided to mess with its formula and gave us ""New Coke,"" the soda no one in America had asked for? Well, the decision by Royal Canin to reformulate Indoor Light 40 gives me feelings of deja vu--why couldn't they just leave well enough alone? Whether that decision was driven by corporate bean counters looking to cut costs--as some here have suggested--I can't say. But the results, at least for my cat, have not been good.

My cat will eat ONLY dry food and, until a few weeks ago, the only brand I've ever fed him is Royal Canin, as recommended by his breeder. As time passed and he put on some weight, I moved to the Indoor Light 40 formula, which was fine... until Royal Canin decided to mess with the formula. His allergic reactions started almost immediately, though it took some consulting with my vet--and reading about similar experiences posted here--before I realized that the changed formula of his food was the cause.

I have now switched to Orijen dry cat food, which has vastly superior, high-protein meats and fish, and only 17% carbohydrates. He loves it, the allergy issues are gone and I feel better feeding him dry food that isn't laden with carbs. When it comes to cats, I can't say if my experience will be your experience. However, there seems to be no benefit to the reformulation of Indoor Light, but it has caused problems for many cat owners, including myself.

Thanks for taking the time to read my review, and I hope you find it helpful in making a buying decision.",2.0,0

06/15/15 I'm changing my rating from five stars to three because the water bottle now falls out of the loop. I guess I've used it enough that the hole has stretched and it bounces enough that the water bottle works its way out of the holder and falls. I've tried just taking a half full bottle, and it still falls out. This started out really nice, but now won't work for me.

"I am an Asian and am 5""3' tall and weigh around 101 pound. I usually wear ""x-small petit"" in the US size. In trying out this cape coat, I can tell this coat is probably made based on Asian size, which means the size would be one to two sizes smaller than the US size. When I live in Taiwan, I usually wore small, and after I moved to the US, I wear x-small petite. So be aware of the size before you purchase this item. I will say go one size up if you follow the US size. For example. If you usually wear small in the US, you probably need to order a size Medium for this coat. I ordered an x-small. It fits, but the shoulder part might be a little bit tight. But I guess a small might be even better for me. The style of this cake coat is simple, cute, and elegant. It will go well with almost anything. It is light weight, and the texture is soft. It is sort of ""thin"" compared to a regular winter coat. It would be good for spring or fall l, but for winter, it will be too thin for me. The quality of the coat is ok. I won't say it is made from very good material.

"I really couldn't be happier with this lead. It is nice and long, so we use it tied to a stake in the yard to practice ""come"" and play fetch. I can stay hands-free and, because it's on a stake that sticks out of the ground, it spins around and doesn't get tangled.  The metal clip works great and is nice and strong. It has been totally sturdy for us so far - our puppy has reached the limit of this on numerous occasions, yet it looks and feels good as new.  She has also grabbed it with her teeth any time she trips on it and no bite marks. You can't tell from the pic and I don't recall it saying in the description but, one end has the metal clip and the other end has a loop like a traditional leash - I just put that around our stake (which has it's own loop at the top so it can't come off) and it stays on perfectly. We leave it out in all weather (rain, sun, wind...no snow yet) and it's still great. It is cotton so I don't know if it will break down over time but I wouldn't hesitate to replace it since it's a great price. It has actually been a sanity saver for me since my puppy seems to love to play fetch - a 10 minute round of this tires her out enough that I can actually get things done in my house without having to always lock her in her crate...and this lead is PERFECT for playing fetch!

"This ball is great, our Catahoula Heeler, Rambo, loves to play with Timmy (we named the ball this when Rambo shoved it into the well ).  The only thing I will caution is the ball is made of heavy duty hard plastic, so if you have a fast dog (like ours) or small dog be careful if  you throw it overhand or it could injure your dog ( I strongly suggest throwing it like a bowling ball at all times).  Also, if you have a Heeler, they love it.  Rambo will play with it for hours and hours and hours, so if you live in the country make sure your dog isn't hurting his mouth or nose with this ball when they first get it.  Rambo rolls on this ball, chases the ball/does soccer moves, cleans the dirt off the ball during rest times and cutest of all will go and and get ball if you ask where Timmy is(he always knows where he put it afterall). The ball has been carried around and chewed on for over a month now by a 70 pound puppy with no bite marks to speak of. The giggle part still works great even though Rambo plays with it on every outside surface imaginable and loves to shove it off ledges and down hills. If he's playing with Timmy we always know where he is, the giggle part is loud enough to hear if you are inside and the ball is being rolled around outside. This is not a toy your dog could play with inside if you were doing anything requiring your puppy to be quiet.",5.0,0

"I remember the 12 inch Indiana Jones doll back in 1981 that was out for about a week, it seemed anyway. It was imposable to find then and I have been waiting for it for years! (Because I wouldn't pay the ridiculous price for it as time went by).
Now with the new movie coming out, thank GOD, here come the Indy figures and dolls! (As nerdy as that sounds).

It comes with a few things to mount it whichever way works for you but I've only used the ring thingy on top to hang it on the shower hook and the suction cup a couple times. Now, the suction cup..I might be missing something but to me it doesn't seem to work very well at all and I don't feel comfortable leaving it suctioned on over water because it'll probably fall in and I don't want to test to see how waterproof it really is. It's really easy to connect it to your Bluetooth and it's way louder than I expected (SCORE!!!)

It springs together nicely after you are done shooting the discs out and stands up without falling over or tipping like some toys do. You can push Cyberex's head down and tilt him up or down, which helps with aiming your shooting discs. We like that the Batman symbol is the end of Cyberex's tail, tying in Batman to the dino looking toy! Over all, it is very well built and has become one of the ""go to"" toys in our household for the boys. We recently had a party and some boys, around the age of 5, were very drawn to it immediately! I like the bright blue coloring with the sliver and gold since it makes it look more robotic. Batman is the perfect size! It is a very fun Batman toy and I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a gift! We did receive it from Mattel as part of a Rate and Play review but it has been one of the most played with toys we have reviewed!",4.0,0

"I'm pretty impressed with this litter trap mat. The material is spongy and soft for the cat to walk on and it's big enough to cover the entrance to our litter box while still providing a lot of cover on either side and in front so the cat can't just jump over it on the way out. The spacing of the material is wide enough so that it really can be vacuumed and shaken out (the previous litter trap mat we had was made from a similar material but once litter got in there it was very hard to get out even after vigorous shaking or vacuuming). It's also a little thicker so that it doesn't feel flimsy. I've had some half-circle litter trap mats and they seemed like a good idea but left too much space on the sides of the entrance. This one covers everything. I really like this thing. Some reviewers mentioned a strong plastic smell when opening this and that's true but it's not a big deal. It's a mat that sits outside your cat's litter box, so plastic odor is not a big deal.

It's definitely not perfect and doesn't catch all litter, but with good positioning it captures most and that perfect product that does it all hasn't been invented yet.",5.0,0

This is a good cage if you can get if for the price that Amazon is selling it. Unfortunately I payed more in stores. This cage is 5 pieces that fit pretty loosely together. It is a good home for Pinto or Robo Hamsters 2in or less. I have an outhouse attached to one of the two side holes. The water bottle should probable be replaced.

"I typically read the negative reviews before I buy something.  This review primarily addresses some of the negative reviews.  I've owned a black one for about 18 months and it is by far my favorite light weight jacket.  I have a camel color on order.  Some say it's larger than what the size label says...  Well, one needs to realize it is a ""golf"" jacket.  Hence, it is extra roomy in just the right areas for a golfer to take a full swing and not feel inhibited.  The medium I own fits like a medium should in the jacket and arm lengths, and the shoulder seams are exactly where they should be.  I have worn this jacket with a polo shirt and it's roomy, but fine.  I've also worn it with two layers of tee shirts and a sweatshirt, and went golfing...  It was great!  Regarding quality issues...  I have worn this jacket at least 250 days over the past 18 months and it shows no signs of wear.  I owned a London Fog overcoat many years ago, and the pocket stitching started unraveling after about 1 year; I sent it to London Fog (I paid for shipping) and they sent me a new overcoat (they paid for shipping).  Three inside pockets...  one on each breast and a lower one for a cell phone.  I've carried a Kindle in one breast pocket, a 7 inch tablet in the other breast pocket (both with protective cases) and my cell phone in the lower inside pocket, and keys and other miscellaneous things in the outside pockets.  I was weighed down a bit, but it worked great, particularly if one is traveling in a foreign country (very secure).",5.0,0

"So, at first I hated this thing. I purchased this for my Oceanic Biocube 29 HQI and I couldn't find a good place for it. I tried the display portion, but the Aqualifter wasn't powerful enough to fill the level correctly within 0 minutes, and the water level had to change at least two centimeters before it would even kick on. I felt it was useless. Then, I relocated the sensor into the 3rd chamber. With my Tunze 9001, it's really tight in the last chamber, but it does fit and it works flawlessly. The water level is topped off about twice a day now and my salinity is stuck perfectly at 35 ppt. I've had no errors with it and I like the many 'safety' features that the controller includes.

This is a good buy for those who want a low-profile level sensor with built-in redundancies to prevent malfunction.",4.0,0

"I've long shied away from bluetooth earbuds because it's annoying when the battery dies, but my corded earbuds were a hassle on runs and such. They didn't stay in my ears well and I would catch the cord and rip them out of my ears. The Phaiser earbuds have changed my tune (pun intended) on BT earbuds. The sound quality is great, and they are really solid in my ears. I've never had them come out or even start to come out. Battery life is pretty solid. My only complaint is a very minor one, and that is that most of the time when I turn them on I get a message saying how much battery life is left, but sometimes the messages doesn't happen. One other thing I would change is that the case that comes with it is big enough for the earbuds and pretty much every accessory and spare part it came with. I would have preferred a more compact case for just the earbuds, as I don't need to carry around the parts that are too small or too large for my ears.

"I bought this because my sheltie is Houdini when it comes to getting out of collars and harnesses.  He's eight years old and this is the first harness he hasn't been able to work his magic on and get loose.

I didn't give it five stars because the sizing is a little screwy.  My sheltie weighs 35 pounds (he's a significantly larger than average sheltie), and he's right in between the small and medium size, and actually I bought both because I wasn't sure which one would fit.  I would have preferred to keep the medium as that fit him with some room to spare on the strap cinches, but the medium harness was too long, with the back strap almost touching his you know what on the underside, so I ended up keeping the small, even though the middle strap has to be almost fully loosened to go around his chest.  The other thing that's a minor inconvenience is that you have to pick up the dog's front leg and manually put it through the middle strap to get it on, because of the way the front strap and the middle strap are connected.  Not a big deal, unless your dog has an issue with you picking up one of it's legs to get this on.

All in all though it's a good harness, made well, and most importantly secure enough that it would be really hard for a dog to get out of it.",4.0,0

"Very simple to set up.  I liked the instruction booklet on how to use.  I am training my dog not to eat washcloths.  She pulls them off the towel rod and swallows them whole.  Fortunately they do not go into the intestine, but stay in her stomach until she vomits them up.  Just started using the Trainer by using the ""beep"".  I lay towels around the house and use the ""beep"" and say ""leave it"" and she does not touch the towels.  I even throw the towels in the air and she does not go for them.  Next I will use the ""shock"" to reinforce.  I always use a tiny treat when she responds positively.  Eventually I hope to leave the bathroom doors open and the towels on the rods without her grabbing them.  I highly recommend this system.",5.0,0

"I had read some reviews saying that this bra ran small and so I ordered TWO band AND cup sizes UP and it was still too small!  Definitely along the lines of a sports bra squish effect.  The sides do come up high.  Glamorise is one the best brands for bras, so I'm very surprised with this one.  The front close idea appealed to me, but look carefully, there are 7 (yes, seven) clasps to do up.  What a pain.  I think if I had ordered 3 sizes up it might be ok.  I won't return it as I'm losing weight, so it might fit better down the road.  Will update review at that time.  If you want a bra that doesn't let you jiggle at all without it being a minimizer and/or without wires, this would be good.

UPDATE:  After very recent gallbladder surgery that left me with a highly tender incision site, I found I couldn't wear any of my regular bras.  I had ordered this one hoping I might be able to tolerate it.  Initially, because it was so tight, I couldn't tolerate this one either.  As I slowly healed, I kept trying the bra.  Due to its elastic nature I was able to adjust this for comfort more than the others.  After about two weeks, much to my amazement, I found the bra had lost its initial snugness and was in fact VERY comfortable!  5 weeks after surgery and this is still the only bra I can tolerate.  The number of clasps in the front turned out to be a bonus as well, because I could choose to leave the bottom clasps undone, adding to the comfort level.  I am still of the opinion that it runs too snug and I'm glad I ordered up.

Take the time to break the bra in!  All bras have a break-in period (in my opinion), and this one is no different.  I'm actually quite happy with it now.",4.0,0

"I was looking for a large hooded box to fit a particular sized space and this box was the right size.  I have seven cats and have tried lots of boxes over the past eight years from all of the major brands, covered and uncovered, high sided, and all shapes and sizes and even tried the storage  box hack idea. I liked the look of this box and the fact that it was covered as two of my boys like to pee on the side of the box.  I thought that the clear top might help prevent ambushes.  I did not know if they would like it.  Not only do they like it, the other morning, three of the boys were lined up to use it.  that is the first time that has happened.  As one left another one went in.

Update: it's been a couple of months since i bought the first one of these clear top boxes and am replacing each of my existing boxes with the Petphabet.  The cats still love these boxes and I love being able to look through the top to see whether its been used and to clean the boxes without having to remove the top to see what is in it.  This saves lots of time especially in the morning and reduces the amount of litter residue that ends up on my clothes before I head off to work.",5.0,0

"I have worn Levi and Wrangler jeans for over 40 years. In recent years I have not been able to find Levi branded jeans in my local Target and Walmart stores. Several pairs of Levi jeans have been worn until they have become threadbare. I love them but replacement has been needed. After looking in Target and Walmart stores I could not find the Levi brand. The  stocked Wrangler brand is decent and costs $ 20 - 25. The  Wrangler sizes are very inconsistent and each pair should be tried on to verify that they fit properly. No two pair seem the same.  However, The Levi brand jeans always fit better and sizing seemed consistent. The Levi denim fabric was a heavier material than the Wrangler brand.

Not having a local source for the Levi brand, I ordered through Amazon. The jeans were about $ 40 vs. the $ 25 Wranglers
available locally. Upon arrival I immediately noted the denim fabric was much thinner than even the Wranglers. As a matter of fact, it was the same thin fabric used on the Walmart house branded jeans.

The zipper and zipper pull were SMALL... much smaller than anything I have ever seen on a pair of adult  jeans. The zipper and pull looked like what used to come on my son's boy jeans.

Last, the jean's waist and length were at least 2 inches large. Years ago, Levi jeans tended to be a bit tighter than other brands.

In summary, the fabric, the zipper, and inconsistent sizes are all  very sub-par. The insult of paying an extra premium price for something much inferior to the Wrangler brand has been a big disappointment.

Unfortunatly, like most games, once you play a long time and master the skills asked...there is little left to do.  The biggest drawback on this one is there is a store you can go to, to buy items for your dog after you earn coins throughout the game...well, my daughter went and bought out all the items as soon as she had the money to do so...then kept going back to the store and realized, they don't restock. So then she stocked up on like 50 bottles of shampoo, water, and dog food :)  Cute, but then she got really frustrated that the screen was really useless at that point and really never needs to go there again.

These dogs do everything, including ""Potty Time""!  Its a really cute game, just wish there were more upgrades, or updates you could download for it to keep the interest in it going.  It drives our cats crazy when my daughter plays it near them b/c the dogs bark all the time, they sound so real!

"So, I wanted to remove an item from my tank. First, I should say, I have a 25G aquarium with a Cascade 700 filter. Which is a canister filter for aquariums up to 65G. Obviously I'm over filtering and it creates a strong current, which I like because I primarily do a planted tank.

Pros;
1) It kept my tank at a very stable 82 degrees. I kept it high on purpose as I breed German Blue Rams. It was fabulous, and I temp gauge always seemed to be working. It turned on/off appropriately.
I really like this stability because it can be harder to get it with glass/titanium heaters that are inside the aquarium.

2) Another item out of the tank! Seriously, it was so nice not having a heater in the tank.

Cons;
1) The main reason I'm sending this back is that it extremely and negatively impacted the water flow rate. In the instructions it says to put it on the outfilter tube -- and I did, but because this device has to be VERTICAL to avoid air bubbles getting trapped, rising to surface, and damaging it-- I had to have a lot of extra tubing. This significant drop in outflow made it impossible for it to properly aerate my water, and it also allowed for algae spores to settle.

Now, a solution to this would be ideally to put it into the infilter tube instead.  However, because I have a planted tank I ultimately decided against this. I didn't want to to deal with lots of gunk getting in the heater pipe. =/ I mean, that's the idea essentially to putting it on infilter over outfilter. It would be easy enough to clean out, but I looked at it as another frustration.

So, because of the cons, I ended up returning it. I mean, even with a circulation pump in my aquarium, I hated that the filter had been impacted so dramatically.",3.0,0

"So far so good! I have been using the darker moon light style Exo Terra bulbs for years and years with our 55 gallon tank for a 4-foot California King Snake. Unfortunately there must be a design flaw with them as they seem to blow out every 3-4 months or so and at $9/bulb it gets annoying!  The reviews on this said that they last for a long long time so I am hoping this really keeps going for a while!

I liked the darker blacklight style of the other one as it was dimly lit. This literally lights up the entire 55 gallon tank it is super bright and then lights up the floor around it. Pretty cool looking bulb and supposedly throw heat down towards the snake up to 16 inches. He seems to be more active when this light is on. Hopefully it does not harm him at all.",5.0,0

"We were lucky enough to receive the Fisher Price Little People City Skyway from Fisher Price for free to check out. My kids (3.5 yer old girl and 17 month old boy) were absolutely enthralled when they saw the box. I could not open it fast enough and then, I could not build it fast enough. Building took some time but overall was easy enough (just need a screw driver). Everything is labeled nicely. My husband says they need to include an extra screw (because he lost one).

I will admit, I was skeptical about this toy. We had seen it in Target previously and my kids were attracted to it like moths to a flame. I remember thinking, ""ummm, not going to happen. One trick pony toy."" However, I'm happy to report, I was super wrong. My kids LOVE this. They've been playing with it everyday, multiple times during the day.

Pros:
-It's huge. Like nearly as  tall as my 3.5 year old huge. Definitely taller than the boy.
-It comes with two cars, Koby and Tessa.
-You don't have to wait for one car to finish before you start the other (essential for the sharing challenged).
-It fits other Little People cars.
-You can slide other cars or things down the ramps (like Octonauts for example).
-The cars can go to three separate exits and they can either go down the ramps on their own or the kids can switch them.
-It really does inspire imaginative play with a fueling station, stop light, crane and gate.
-It spans the ages nicely.
-No batteries!!!!
-Sturdy. Doesn't fall over easily and seems like it could take a pretty good beating at the hands of children.

Cons:
-It IS big so if space is limited this could take up precious space. If your kid is really into cars though, it's totally worth it.

All in all, this is worth the asking price. Would make a fantastic holiday or just because present!",5.0,0

"I have had many Sony Walkman's over the years. The sound on this one simply does not compare. It is an easy to operate, fairly sturdy device, but in my opinion is way over priced for what you get. And that isn't the main issue. The problems started after I had it for a few months. I would plug it into the my computer and it would not register as a connected device. It would charge and show the battery screen on the Walkman but the computer couldn't detect it. I had to plug it in and unplug is several times to get it to work. Then it stopped registering no matter what I did. I wondered if my computer driver was corrupted..even though it worked fine on other devices.  When I bought a new laptop and tried to connect it again...same problem. It would charge but fail to go to the screen that showed it was being detected so I could not load music. It would instead either attempt to play a song or go to the charge screen without registering on the computer. I went into settings and used ""restore factory settings"". It made no difference. I then used the hard reset on the unit in hopes that would work. No go. If these were not priced so outrageously I might chalk this up to a bad unit and buy another, but for what you get...and with the issues I have had....not worth it.",3.0,0

"Nice magnifier for the price.  I looked at 3 brands when shopping.  Eotech , Vortex and Sightmark.  The Eotech is great but it is way out of my price range.  The sightmarks action to move it out of the way felt cheap and was not very fluid.  The Vortex went on sale for 159 which was a bargain.  The VMX-3T flips out of the way with a simple button movement.  Can easily be done on the fly one handed.  I like the way it feels.  The magnifier is very clear and works great when paired with a Eotech 512.  It comes with a hight spacer so that you can raise it a smidge if it is to low.  You can fully adjust where it is pointed through the side and top adjustments (like any scope).

The one down side which I find on all scopes if your eye is not at the right distance it shrinks the field of view.  I did not find this to bad in shooting with it though.

"This lens is such a huge improvement over the standard kit lens. When I first acquired my Pentax Kr, I was very happy with the camera as I got back in to photography after being away for 15 years. The Kr is my first digital SLR and I felt that I could achieve great quality pictures without film with a reasonably priced kit. After 18 months, however, I was finding that there was still a quality to my images, particularly of people, that was lacking. At first, I thought it might be the camera. Then, on recommendations from other Pentax users, I decided to give this lens a try. Immediately, my images are sharper, and more colorful than with the standard kit lens. In addition, the larger aperture makes shooting in low light very easy and the bokeh is out of this world. I am very happy with this upgrade. I only wish that Pentax would have made the kit lens a bit better so it would be more useable.",5.0,0

- They are adjustable.
- They are comfortable.
- They come with a pouch, offering some protection.
- They come with a 1-year warranty by Amazon.

CONS:
- They aren't foldable. I wish they were more compact, the best I can do is rotate the swivel ear cups to a ""flat"" position.
- There aren't that many colors to choose from.

"My plecostomus devour these (API) algae wafers in no time flat. They apparently love the taste. I feed them these daily and occasionally give them some fresh zucchini. I like that the wafers settle on the bottom of the tank quickly and dissolve easily.

"I have to put the disclaimer out there that we are not done training!! This is why I've only given 4 stars. I had to pause in the training as we went away (kitty went with) and didn't want to thoroughly confuse the poor guy!

I have a young Maine Coon. He's approx. 17lbs. The CitiKitty has no trouble holding his weight. I considered toilet training after meeting a woman who has four cats and 1 bathroom. She and her husband trained their four cats to all use the toilet. It made me chuckle when she told us about it, but it stayed in the back of my mind.

I got tired of stepping in litter - the Big Naughty is a slob! - and remembered the toilet training scenario mentioned above and decided to look into it.

Week 1:
The first week this worked really well. The Big Naughty didn't have any accidents.

Week 2:
After removing the inner ring, Naughty wasn't as big a fan of going on the toilet. He had a few accidents, and once he started going on the toilet again he decided he didn't like (or couldn't figure out) to go poo in the toilet; so he would go on the floor beside the toilet. As suggested we kept the ring at the week 2 mark for an extra week, but then I went away for the holidays and took him with me so I decided to put the training on hold until after we returned so as not to confuse him.

I've yet to commence training again, I have quite a busy schedule. I am looking forward to starting again and completing the training. I dream of the day I do not step in the scattered litter on the bathroom floor, no longer having to sweep litter up daily, no longer buying litter, no more scooping litter, etc.

"We have a small family and have been using them for a long time. They are very comfortable. I bought this for my son, he loves it! He wears a size 12 and it fits him well. It's a little big on him but he's always happy with his new one. Great shirt. I will be buying more. I ordered a size 8 and it fit perfect! My grandson had to wear a size 8 and it was way too long. I am very pleased with this purchase. My son is a size 8 and this is perfect!  He is 6 months old and it's a little snug. The material is soft and comfortable. I am very pleased with this purchase. Very comfortable and my son loved it!Bought this for my husband and he was very pleased with it. He is a 36D and wears a medium. I love the color and the fit. It's a nice fit.

"I do not order articles of clothing unless I have tried them on in person. I have a difficult time finding clothes that fit. I decided to order this dress and crossed my fingers. I have never been more surprised at the fit!

I ordered the black dress with a red edge/outline on the neck and bow. The dress arrived quickly thanks to Amazon Prime. It was packaged in a plastic bag. I definitely would recommend upgrading to the gift-wrapping service if you are sending this dress as a gift.

I removed the dress from the package and was happy that I did not smell anything weird. I worry with less expensive items that they smell like chemical. This is not the case with this dress.

The dress is an excellent fit. I cannot believe how good of a fit. I normally wear a 12 (US) and I ordered the XL. I also was happy that I can wear my normal bras with this dress and the straps do not show, seriously, look at the pictures. The bra is not visible!

I am happy with the purchase so far but will update this review if there is an issue. I may only use this a couple hours on a date night so use is infrequent.

I am not connected in any way to this company but I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion. I use reviews myself when shopping online and I hope this is useful information for you. Don't hesitate to ask questions and I will update if there is a problem in the future.

As a bonus, the chain is very comfortable. The chain is one of the most comfortable I've ever owned. The chain itself is a great quality and the color is beautiful. I would highly recommend this chain. I love this dress. The material is soft and comfortable. I love the color and the fit. I ordered a medium so I could wear it to work. The dress is a bit big on me but it fits well and is flattering. I highly recommend this dress. I bought these for my mom who is a nurse and she loves them. She has a lot of work to do and it's hard to find a bra that is comfortable and warm for her. They are also very comfortable for her to wear. She's 5'2"" and they fit her perfectly. My only complaint is that the straps are way too long for her. I'm not sure why. This is my second pair of this cute shoe. I normally wear a size 10 in these and they fit perfect. I wore them for a few hours and they seemed to be holding up very well. The sole seems to be a bit stiff on my feet. I have trouble with the heel and heel slipper on my shoe. The only downside is that the shoe is a little narrow. It is well made and I like that it is a little longer than my previous pair.

"Okay so logitech has been very well known in making good webcams. This cam arrived ontime. There however was a problem where the mic wasn't really working well or something. I returned it and got another one that seems to work pretty well.

Now the video quality is pretty good. Even though it might not be the best compared to their newest one (That long blue expensive webcam they just came out with a year ago) but its pretty good if you want a cam that is cheaper, especially after the rebate if they are still offering one.

Unfortunately the mic seems to not be the best it could have been but considering my previous webcam was so old it was fuzzy looking this mic works a lot better. I wanted one with a really good mic as well as good video quality. The video quality is great but the features it comes with are kinda lacking. Im talking about the little animations and such. You don't get a lot when you first install it you have to hunt down some good ones on the website in order to get some cool looking ones.

The other features such as low light can be good or bad depending on how you use them. Also the ""right sound"" seems to just make things worse I think. Its hard to say since I don't use my webcam that often.

However I think this is one of the better webcams you can pick these days. Just make sure to check it out and try it out a bit right away when you get it just incase you get a faulty one like I did. Oh and logitech has a forum for questions and they usually answer them right away or within a day or two. I have bought quite a few logitech products and even though sometimes I come across one or two that I need to return, in the long run they have good products.",5.0,0

"I have had 3 pairs of this headset. I lost one, bought one for my wife, and bought myself a replacement. As a mono bluetooth it works great, although a bit on the heavy side. As a stereo bluetooth I love it. I love not having a wire connecting to my phone when I am working out. I don't know how many times I unplugged or ripped my phone out of my pocket when the wired headset cable got snagged on something. This is just so much more convenient. Some complain that the sound it not as good, but I find it more than adequate for working out. When you buy a stereo bluetooth you are not looking for concert sound as much as you are looking for the safety and convenience of not having connecting wires hanging out of your ears. My only complaint is the ear look is of very poor design. I have had to call Jabra several times to order replacements because the bendable wire section breaks from the hard plastic part that goes into the ear piece. It got to the point that Jabra would just send me 3 complimentary ear loops at no charge.",4.0,0

When I inquired about the wisdom of designing a product that does not use an aspect ratio consistent with the image produced by cameras, I was told---it wasn't my decision.

Even if I could change the aspect ratio (which leaves part of the screen as wasted), you cannot turn on and start the slide show while the device is in the frame.  Consequently, I don't think it would get used very much.

1. When you use the O Scanner make sure you scan all the way because if you don't it won't tell you the combo name. Also, you can put the medals in different orders and it still will work. You can even have 3 head, 3 torso, or 3 legs medals and they would still work. There are endless combinations you can use.

2. Use Velcro and luggage straps so you can adjust the belt to your size. It's far cheaper than buying the extension belt.

3. The medals are smaller than they appear. In fact I was shocked at how small they were.

"Overall this TV has an awesome picture.  White is bright brilliant white, and it almost looks like a samsung panel due to its glossy look, just instead of samsung logo you see TCL.  This TV was 429, does 1080p and has tons of hook ups.  More than most people will need.  I also own a 55"" LED Sony TV, and I dare say picture quality is barely below the sony, and may look better on cable, due to the compression used, and the fact it doesnt need to strech the compressed image another 15 inches.

My only complaint for all TCL TV's at this time, is the lack of universal remotes being able to control them.  I have a 2 TCL TV's right now (the 32 inch and 40 inch) and my Comcast DVR remote cannot control them.  Their is no code in the manual for TCL at all, and when you use the ""Search for code"" feature, i went through it about 200 times, and could not get it to shut the TV off.  I have also read may posts about people having this same issue.  As best as I can tell at this time there are only 2 remotes confirmed to work with these TV's 1 being a 29 dollar logitech and the other being a Sony universal remote for about 15 bucks.  Thats why I knocked off 1 star.

"I recently purchased the ""ultra"" model on Amazon along with the forever litter tray and crystals.  I haven't used the Forever litter tray yet (the Scoopfree Ultra came with one tray/crystals so I'm using that first.)  The scoopfree ultra machine seems very sturdy and I'm very satisfied with my purchase so far.  I really like the counter that keeps track of how many times the machine is used, at first I thought it was an unnecessary feature, but it really helps to know the cats are actually using it and when to replace the cartridge.  I have two cats and at first they saw the machine and were scared of it.  I mixed in some of their old litter and took away the old litter box completely and I'm happy to report they are both using it!  I'm keeping the hood off for now, I'm concerned that they feel too intimidated if they are enclosed inside the box, I will put it back on in the future when they are more comfortable with the new machine.  When my item was delivered, it was not sent in a shipping box with padding, only in the manufacture's box with a label slapped on.  Needless to say the box was beaten and looked taped together when it arrived.  In hindsight, I probably would recommend buying the box at a local pet store instead of online, luckily I've never had to return anything to amazon, but it seems like it would be a big hassle if the unit arrived broken or the cats decided not to use it.

"I'm a huge fan of the Saucony Jazz sneaker. They're not the most durable, nor are they particularly good for exercise or whatever. They're comfortable, though, and will serve as a basic fitness shoe. Moreover, they are fashionable. They always look classy, and this is a style that I don't think will ever really go out of style.

The best part is that they're priced in such a way that I don't feel terrible about replacing them once a year. I blow through a pair of these in about a year, but Amazon usually has one or more colors of them available for a really reasonable price point. This time I went with an all-black style, but I also have some green ones. It's a lot like wearing the converse all stars, but you get a lot more support for your foot.

"If you want the convenience of buying puppy training pads in bulk and want a great price this is a great choice. These Wee Wee brand pads are by Four Paws, the same company that makes the better quality pads sold at Petco and the other big box stores.

These pads are 22""X23"" with a thick absorbent top layer and a blue plastic bottom layer. They are very absorbant and offer ""odor control"". They work very well.

Entirely Pets takes a long time to ship. They claim that their low product price requires them to cut costs on shipping. I did not anticipate waiting almost two weeks and ran out of pads.

I purchased a small supply of what I thought was the exact same Four Paws product at Petco and noticed that in addition to being much more expensive, the pads were ""improved"". They were quilted and more absorbent. I don't know if Petco is selling a newer version of the product and Entirely Pets is selling out old inventory at an excellent price or if Entirely Pets is just selling a cheaper and lesser quality version.

In my experience, the difference in quality really doesn't matter. The cheaper pads work well enough. They don't leak. They protect the floor and provide the dog with a safe place to go should the need arise.

What does matter is the price and the convenience of buying in bulk. These pads are quite satisfactory.",4.0,0

"I was looking for something to protect my Kindle DX in transit. I decided I would rather just take the Kindle out to read than get the kind of case designed to hold the Kindle while you read. I use the Kindle mostly at home, so for most of the time I don't need a case, and when I do go somewhere with it, I can simply take it out of this case to use.

This case is ideal for my purposes. It is extremely light--3.5 ounces, according to the Amazon Product Details--and very well padded. It's easy to fit the Kindle in and take it out. The case seems well-made and sturdy. I would like it even better if it had a handle or strap, but that is not enough of a drawback to take away a star.

In sum, a fine product that does exactly what I want.",5.0,0

"I got this for my Golden Retriever pup when she got spayed.  It fit the neck almost perfectly (she's at about 12 inches, so I got the medium).  It's very soft and pretty comfy.  It didn't bother her at all.

The problem is that as a larger breed, she was simply too long.  She could easily curl her body enough that she could get to the stitches around the donut without much of a problem at all.  So it was pretty useless for it's intended purpose.  But that's partly my fault for getting the wrong size.  It would have helped if they listed the outer diameter of the donut as well.  For reference, the medium is about 10-11 inches wide on the pup.  The donut itself is about 3.75 inches fully inflated.

So if you have a larger breed, absolutely go a size (or more) higher.",3.0,0

"I've had my XTi for just over a month now (bought from Amazon) and it's really improved my photography.  Others have even commented that I've ""shifted to a new gear"".  Features are a nice improvement from the DSLR-wannabe I had before (Panasonic FZ30) but it's the image quality that's really the big step up.  Get the best-quality lenses for this (*not* the kit lens) and you'll be very happy.

Pros:

* Image Quality
* Ergonomics (most common settings are easy to change, good displays)
* Battery life (200 shots with 50% flash and battery still said 100%)
* The user manual is decent, though not stellar.
* Long exposure noise reduction feature is very good.
* Good set of customization options (though the manual doesn't explain them enough).

Cons:

* Canon's organizer/editor software, Digital Photo Professional, always crashes on my Windows PC and technical support was no help.
* Hand grip is too small (height and volume) for my large hand.  Make sure you handle one first.  I had to train myself to squish all three fingers into the space provided so my pinky didn't hang off the bottom.  This is a real step backwards from the original Digital Rebel.
* Some settings that I use a lot are hidden too far in the menus.
* Sensor dust cleaner won't get everything.  I had to manually blow dust off the sensor (with a blower, *NOT* my breath!) about 1 week after I got this, though no sensor dust since.

Conclusion:
I'm *very* glad I bought this camera and look forward to many years using it.

BTW, Amazon farms this order out to another vendor, so you won't get free shipping and you'll have to contact that vendor separately to get an order tracking number.

"Bought The Satechi SD Mini & the X-Mini Happy from Amazon.

The X-Mini Happy was $28 more (at the time)
and also came with a 2GB SD Card (mini with adapter)
plus Earphones (Plug Type).

Both came with a Pull String Carry Sack.

I loaded 2 SD cards with the same MP3s,
synchronized the start as best as possible,
and compared the sound of each using the respective Mute Buttons.

No Doubt About It: the X-Mini Happy had a Better Sound.

The SD Mini sounded OK until it was being compared to the X-Mini Happy.

The X-Mini Happy seemed to have a Fuller Sound -
Particularly with the Classical Music

"I've done my research on cavy food.  And from all that i have read, I know this is quality guinea pig food.

Now that she's older, I really wanted to make sure she is getting quality food without all the junk treats.  and the verdict....She doesn't like it.  She won't hardly touch this stuff.  We've had it for a month, and she squeals at us, like we are not paying attention to her.  But I know this is the best food for her longevity.  So I will continue to feed it to her.

"My one year-old son totally loves his other Oball trucks, but I admit that I was a little unsure about this one -- I really didn't think that he would figure out how it works, and I wasn't sure that it would be as ""fun"" as a dump truck or bulldozer. Well, I unpacked it from the frustrating packaging one night and left it on the floor, and the next morning he found it while I was making breakfast. By the time I came over to see what he was doing, he was opening the sides up and taking he cars out, stacking other things in there, closing it up again, and running the truck around. There's even a little ramp that comes down the back for the cars to come down from.

The only downside for me on this one is that the design seems a little more finicky than most toys we use at this age. When you're closing either one of the sides of the carrier or the ramp, their are bits on either end of it that need to snap in. To get both, you either need to realize that you need to push in on both edges of the ramp and on both ends of the each of the flap down sides, or you need to apply pressure pretty exactly in the middle -- so with a young child, it's super common for just one end to snap in and the other end to still be unlatched, which in this house sometimes means that the doors flop back open when you hit a bump. It's not the end of the world, and I'm sure he'll figure it out as he gets a bit older -- but it's occasionally frustrating for him now.",4.0,0

"HAUPTSTADTKOFFER Luggage Set-This 3 piece set arrived within 2 days. Thanks Amazon Prime! I have to say WOW! I am pleasantly surprised by the quality. This particular set is in WHITE with a shiny finish featuring a vertical grooved pattern. I'm hoping the pattern will prevent denting. There is a protective clear plastic wrap encasing the set. Attached labels & Instructions are provided on how to reset the generic 000 lock code. This luggage genuinely exceeds my expectations. I first seen the Non-Prime HAUPTSTADTKOFFER Luggage set on Amazon and the 4 differences were it had a (1) matte finish, (2) Luggage front had the Company name on a silver metal plate (classy touch) & 3rd-it was priced approximately $70.00 more (or so). My main concern was the company didn't guarantee the 2 day shipping. However, this set is gorgeous, featuring expander zippers, 360 spinner wheels that keep spinning (quietly), zipper pockets/compartment on the L side & an elastic X strap securing the (R) compartment  for larger items. The handles flow easily up and down & the set is easy to maneuver, but still feels sturdy. I purchased Amazon fabric packing cubes in the same color pattern, White mesh with a Black zipper. It compresses your clothing & frees up valuable space.

"From a play standpoint, this nerf blaster is one of the more fun toys to come out from them in awhile.  It has, to my mind, a bit of a HUNGER GAMES feel to it, resembling a cross bow as it does, rather than a gun.  And it's very cool that it shoots three streams of water.  Kids love that ""bonus.""  It's fairly compact, so it's great for a smaller child (7+, I would say) to run around and have some good, clean fun.  Nerf blasters generally feel relatively sturdy, but I have to say, this one feels even a bit more substantial than usual.  Good stuff...5 star fun.

But minus 1 star for the rather silly marketing.  The use of the word ""Rebelle"" (yes, a feminized version of Rebel) is silly, and even borderline sexist.  It's done in pastel colors, so of course only girls will like it.  And the packaging only features girls.  I'm just not sure this makes great marketing sense, and I'd like to think if I were running Nerf, we'd find a way to start making ALL our blasters / soakers appealing to both genders.

One the thing I do need to note is a lot of people thought they were upside down because of how the wings are, look at the picture and you'll noticed the straight lines face down and the curving detail faces up...on other wings it is the other way around.

"Well, it just came in the mail and I was so excited (my 7 months old adopted dog is a mad chewer, particularly on cords) that I opened it immediately and began to put it on my iPad cord. I carefully put it in and squeezed it shut to be sure no actual cord was exposed. It stunk like mad, but I figured that would die down and at least my cords weren't being destroyed - heck, if I had to I could charge it in another room, right? I had the 10 foot size open because it's a long cord, so only a small piece had to be trimmed. My fingers are reeking by now, and I'm about to eat lunch, but hey, the dog won't chew on it, right? I deliberately left the cord on the floor while I went to make my lunch, peeking in on the puppy. Stayed away completely, so I couldn't tell if it would deter. Went in to eat (or try to, it really smelled fresh out of the package) and the puppy was sitting off to the side, behaving himself, so...... WAIT! What's that. He's chewing on the small piece of cord protector I cut off. And as I watched to see if it bothered him at all, he continued to worry it and chew.
Maybe this stuff works on some dogs. I'm going to have to try the bitter Apple repellant spray I bought along with this and hope for the best. Sure wish I hadn't gotten 2 packs of each size though. With that smell, and the poor results, no way I'm using it.",1.0,0

"This is a great accessory for those with a play kitchen and can be used as a stand alone with just a little imagination which kids tend to have a lot of. It comes with enough pieces that two children can have fun with without actually fighting over them, but you know kids, they still might. The pieces are very sturdy and what I've come to expect from Melissa & Doug products.

The highlight of the set is definitely the timer which actually works and my little one has been having fun ""making dishes"" while using the timer, the way we do in our own kitchen. The salt and pepper shaker actually shakes so she pretends to put them on her food as well. They are all perfectly sized for small hands and with no small pieces, it would be great for kids as young as two.

You can read from the description what comes in the set so I'm not going to bore you with that, but what I can say is this is a must buy. I've purchased kitchen accessory sets before that even came with ""food"" and they felt cheap and inferior. Now I mostly pick up pieces from IKEA but this is one I will totally recommend.",5.0,0

"Very nice set of pencils, they color beautifully in adult coloring books, especially for very intricate coloring.  However if coloring larger areas, they do take a lot more time to blend so start/stop lines are not visible, but it can be done.  (I'd recommend using Primascolor pencils for coloring books with mermaids, fairies, ect...)

I tested them against Crayola, Prang, Rose Art, and Prismacolor Soft Core Pencils.  They color so much smoother  than the Crayola, Prang, and Rose Art.  They definitely are not a replacement for Prismacolor pencils, they are still a step below them.  The pencils sharpen very nicely just using the Prismacolor Scholar sharpener (it's the green one).  Where as for my Prismas I have to use the black sharpener.

I have the 72 pencil set, about 20 of the colors are very close to each other, almost duplicates even.  It could of easily been a 48-50 pencil set if they rearranged the colors included in the 48 pencil set they offer.  I did purchase the metallic 12pk set as well which I'm waiting to be delivered.

"There are many hoof supplements and they tend to have very similar ingredients, but do vary.  This means that depending on exactly why your horse doesnt have top quality hooves, different supplements may work better for your particular horse.  Or, of course, if your horses hooves are of poor quality for a reason not related to nutrition, supplements may do nothing at all.

B vitamins, particularly biotin folic acid and Bs are important for the hoof.  According to the guaranteed analysis, this supplement only has biotin.  It does offer a high level of this, at 25 mg per serving.

Zinc and copper are the mineral supplements most likely to help hooves and this supplement offers them both.

A deficiency of particular amino acids can cause problems with the hooves.  The white line can deteriorate if there is a deficiency of methionine.  This supplement is high in protein and does offer methionine.  However, several other hoof supplements offer more methionine, so if your horse has issues with his white line, take a look at Hooflex Hoof Builder or Farriers Formula Double Strength.

Hooves need both omega 3 and omega 6 fatty acids and this offers both, though twice as much 6 and 3, so this isn't the greatest supplement for omega-3 fatty acids, though you can buy those as a separate supplement.

Nearly all of the nutrients important to hoof health are also important to coat quality, so if your horse is lacking in both it is quite likely that a hoof supplement such as Horseshoers Secret Extra Strength will help.  If this one doesnt do the job, look for another that offers different hoof-related nutrition  perhaps one with more omega-3 fatty acides, more B vitamins, or a different mix of amino acids.

There is no one best hoof supplement, because what the horse is eating for the rest of his nutrition is such a big factor.  However, for most horses showing less than idea hoof quality, this is a reasonable starting point to see how they respond.",4.0,0

"I bought this used off of EBay, but I would recommend this computer to anyone out there. The main reason that I say that is Apples are built to last, I don't mean the case or the screen or anything like that. What I mean is Apple does not make a bunch of different configurations of computers in the same year. There are two or three models out there a year and they are all priced over $1000, why, because they last.

In the past year I have upgraded this computer in three ways.

1. Went from 4GB RAM to 8GB RAM. Want to have a fast computer, just add RAM. I have never had an issue with that.
2. Upgraded the Hard Drive to a 120GB SSD, wanna talk about speed. 9 seconds from hitting the power to surfing the internet.
3. Removed the Super Drive and added a 1TB Hard Drive for storage. I don't know of an HP, Dell, Gateway, Acer, IBM or any of the other PC companies that you can do that with. (Admittedly once I got a Mac I never look anything up about a PC again).

As for performance, I have no complaints. There is nothing that I have attempted to do that I have had an issue with this computer. It seems with a PC that within a year some of the Software out there outperforms the specs on a computer that you just bought when you go down the PC route.

Here is what I would say to you. Sure you can buy a $300 PC from WalMart or somewhere, I bet that it might be in the trash or sold within two years.

This item is definitely not what the average-sized female would consider as a 1-size fit.  I am 5'7"", 36 DDD and have a long torso.  I started not to even bother trying it on because it looks tiny coming out of the package.

It even reached far enough to cover my backside but wasn't long enough to wear into a public place such as a store/coffee shop, etc., after a day at the beach.  The material is soft, slinky, inviting and very comfortable, even despite the fact that I thought it was too small.  The colors are bright, vibrant and cheerful.

"I have spent some amount of time playing with this walnut sized wonder. It is unexplainably addictive. Maybe it's the rather cool free apps that Ozobot has available for it. Maybe it's the color changing LED lights. Maybe it's the way you calibrate and tune it. The cool factor is just off the charts. I like the Ozobot Dance app the best. You place it on a space and with light flashes it programs this little beast. Then you press play and it signals the robo critter to do it's thing. It will go on top of your tablet or phone spinning, flashing and scooting along.

It must have taken quite some engineering to come up with this. To distill it for you it's sensors can detect lines and colors. It will change what it's doing, program itself and perform all of it's functions that way. Everything you need comes in the box. A couple of things to share with you: Instructions say you need to calibrate and tune it every time before you use it. But you can use it a few times without doing that, it seems if you only wait a few moments before uses it seems to hang on to it's setup. But if it's shut off for more than a few minutes you definitely need to go through the calibration/motors tune process (very easy).

It's not entirely perfect all the time during the tune process. Sometimes it seems to forget what it's doing, you just put it back in it's start position and usually it will be fine. Occasionally you will turn it off then repeat the tuning process. It's not a hassle. The whole experience is fun. Registration is free and gives you access to a lot of extras at no charge. I love this little nugget of technology. I've attached a picture with a sugar packet in comparison to give you an idea of it's true size. Sample for fair review.",5.0,0

I wouldn't say that it would be great to carry around all day because it's softer than a plastic carrier, but great to transport.

"Amazing toy. Bought one for our 7 yr old niece and played around with it. Seems to be the hotness of 2013. But let's not lose our heads, here. It is merely a reconfigured Nerf Blaster. Instead of a trigger or a pump, you pretend to release a string. Aiming is more luck than skill. Comes with five whole darts.

If they really want to learn about archery, you'd be better served buying a simple 'starter' bow and arrow set for about the same price. Teaches them a skill AND not to shoot their friends! My dad taught me to shoot when I was young and it is still a fun and relaxing hobby for me. This will not teach them anything, but dang, it's fun!

Some advice on the price:
-This retails for abouts twenty dollars. All my local retailers were sold out, and about two hours after purchasing it from Amazon the price here more than doubled. I see a lot of annoyed shoppers giving this one star over the price and that's bad form. You don't like the price, don't buy it. Don't mislead other shoppers about this great, fun product because the vender is gouging. Amazon isn't always the best price. I've seen a few 'hot' products sold for much cheaper locally (Target, WM, TrU) and while Amazon is great for most holiday shopping, in this case, at this moment, they aren't. ALWAYS remember to price check!
-Don't be suckered into buying the 'girly' refills, the ones that match the colors of the bow. They cost more than twice the price of the regular orange ones! (Now THIS is some sexist gouging!) Kids don't care what color their ammo is and not everything girls touch needs to be pink. Save some money and pick up a pack of standard Nerf refills.",5.0,0

I previously had a homemade file server (basically an old 700MHz Compaq PC with two 500GB hdds installed, running Ubuntu Server).  This Dlink just sips the power.  I measured both the old server vs the Dlink DNS-325 using a Kill-a-watt.  Here are my findings:

My old server was using ~ 72.5 W.  The DNS-325 used 8 W (3.5 while asleep).

My old server used 13.96 kWh over 209 hrs.  The DNS-325 used 0.14 kWh over 24.39 hrs.

My old server cost roughly $4.26 per month to operate.  The DNS-325 should cost at most 37 cents.  It will be less than half that if I allow it to sleep.

This Dlink uses less than 1/10 the power that my old file server used.  It will pay for itself in less than three years.",5.0,0

"Play-doh equipment has always looked super fun on the shelf at the store.  However most of the time when you get it home, it either breaks, you lose pieces, or it just doesn't work as well as it should.  The Candy Cyclone does come with a lot of easy to lose parts, and not a great way to store them.  The most amazing part for me is that when done properly, this thing actually works.

Couple of things we have learned when using this.  If the back of the toy is open at all, the crank will not turn (this is to ensure safety I presume).  If you put a huge chunk of play-doh into it, it won't work.  You have to make thinner logs, and then feed it into the machine, which will then make little balls roll down the track.  If you stuff a lot in, then you're going to be opening up the back trying to get play-doh out, which is quite annoying and hard.  You can then take these little play-doh balls and use the stamper to turn them into other little things.  It's gotten a lot of us from our daughter (who is 2 1/2) and also her cousins, (4-6) who also spent lots of time playing with it.

Things that could be improved, ideally there would be a way or a tool to make the correct shaped log, or a way to just stuff play-doh in and it still work without jamming up.",4.0,0

"I bought this for my daughter at a local dollar store(don't pay more than 10 for it in 2011, they've got them again this year) last year. Due to lack of batteries(3 Ds- we kept using them in our son's crib soother) and me kind of forgetting that it was up in the cupboard, we didn't use it for months and months. But we got it out the other night and she had an absolute blast with it. Yes, the pegs don't stick very well due to the truncated ends, if they'd put another quarter inch on the tapered part, they'd be fine. It uses 6 3/4 inch square pieces of paper- we're going to see if we can find some heavy origami paper to use with it because the refills are expensive.

Keep in mind that there is no off switch, it's timed and turns itself off every few minutes, it's easily turned back on by pushing the button located just above the peg storage.

Even with it's faults- it's all plastic, pegs don't stick, I still think it's a good product, just needs some tweaking. Some people say they have problems with the peg holder, which is semi circular tube shaped, you rotate it to get the opening out, but we haven't had any. I taught my daughter(who will be five in 2 months) that it's gotta be flat in order to open the pegs, and she can do it herself, as well as close it up.

In fact, if you overlook the cost of refills or having to cut construction paper to fit, it's an excellent product for the price I paid. It lets her be creative and not messy, and helps her patience level lol.",4.0,0

"We have 4 cats. They all seem to love this litter. They go in, dig around awhile, do their duty and then they spend a more than usual time scratching around in the litter box before they exit. We, at first, though that it was because they were having a difficult time covering up their duty with the light litter. We were wrong. We have two litter boxes downstairs (and two upstairs) sitting side-by-side so we performed an experiment on the two downstairs litters. We put light litter in the left hand box and clay litter in the right. In the morning we filled one litter with their usual clay based litter and one with this light litter. The cats used them all day. At the end of the first day the box with the light litter was used about 30% more than the clay. On the second day the light litter box was use almost exclusively. There were only a couple of pee clumps in the clay litter. On the third day we reversed the positions of the two litter boxes. Now they were clay left and light right. Only the right box (light litter) was used all day. The clay litter box was clean! Both upstairs clay litter boxes were pretty much unused except for some pee. I have since seen the cats standing in line waiting to use the light litter box while the clay litter box was being left unused and completely vacant. Darndest thing I've ever seen. Now we're putting clay in the bottom and light on top until the clay is gone. From then on, light litter ONLY. Oh yeah, the light  litter does not track-out on the cat's paws and then onto the floor nearly as much as the clay litter. This makes my wife very happy.",5.0,0

"I feed two indoor fairly picky cats, and a colony of about five outdoor non-picky cats.  So I have a built in team ready to help me test cat food!  I was eager to try this dry food.  It's always good to read on the bag about the caring people that put together foods for our feline friends, and this one looked well thought out and full of interesting and nutritious ingredients (although I always do wonder if cats really need cranberries or sweet potatoes or the like, but they are used to take the place of grains, which I am sure cats don't need).

Well, my feline crew did not care much for the food.  The indoor cats did eat it eagerly for the first few bites---they must have liked the smell or the look---but after that, they shunned it.  They would not eat it at all, and in fact found things around the house to put on top of the plates of it---something they do to bury food they really don't care for.  The outdoor cats were not much more of fans.  They ate a bit of it, and then looked at me with annoyance, wanting their usual cans.  I left the dry food down, and later in the day they did eat a small amount, but most of it was left by the end of the day, which is quite unusual.

So---no matter how well made and well meaning a cat food is, if your cats won't eat it, it's not really worth it.  I can't say what it is they didn't like---I wish I could get that information from them!  Perhaps you have less picky cats---lucky you!",3.0,0

"I'm a perfectionist, in all I do and in my work; I expect the same pride in workmanship and design as I put into my own designs and products...

This cheap, thin, tin-like metal has no substance to it at all; its tantamount to a polished tin can. The 'anti spill' ring (atop the bowl) is too large for small breeds such as my 20 pound Shih-Tzu.  It arrived with the rubber, anti-slide/anti-skid, gasket detached, it falls off very easily and is nearly impossible to replace without stretching it, which totally defeats its purpose, in that it falls off almost every time you pick it up.

There is a hollow space under the anti spill, upper rim, that is impossible to keep clean.  Having no instructions, enclosed, who could possibly know that upper anti spill rim is designed to come off?  Good luck managing that feat and be careful not to pinch your skin both wrestling it off and getting it back on.  Having shopped finer boating and camping stores, I found this is a really bad knock off of the ones I have found since.

My really good dog food bowls are stainless steel, incredibly heavy and have lasted 3 lifetimes (dog lives) they cost a small fortune when I bought them 20 years ago, but were more than worth it.  I was looking for comparable water bowls when giving this a try; and it is not even close to being close.

Unless you only need this for the boat or camper for a week or two and a few weekends a year...  Do yourself a favor and buy heavy duty, stainless steel and don't have names put on (unless removable).  Spend the money once and never again.

"Fit: I wear size 9 ladies shoes, and the sock size 9-11 fits well, without pulling on the toes.  The leg portion is very comfortable, but the top of the band leaves an indentation in my leg, and that's why I dropped one star from these excellent socks.  I'm folding the tops down to avoid that, but in my active outdoor life, I prefer higher socks for protection against insect bites.

For running around the house in socks, these are wonderfully comfy.  Where they really shine, though, is when you put on your shoes, and they never felt so good!

Construction:  You can see in the picture the open mesh knit on the top of the foot for coolness.  There's a ribbed band that goes completely around your instep to hug your foot. The bottom of the sock, including the top of the toes and up the back of the heel (except for the area of the instep ribbing) is all cushioned with terry loop knit on the inside.  So the sole is thicker than the top, and it's very comfortable.  You have cushioning where you need it most, without making the socks too hot or bulky.

Materials: With years of experience knitting socks myself, I can advise that for long-lasting socks, get at least 10% nylon in the fibers.  These socks exceed that, and should wear very well.

These are my favorite store-bought socks yet, but I'll keep looking for something that doesn't leave an indentation on my calf.  You can bet I'll be wearing these often in the meantime, though, and especially in hot weather.

UPDATE: After several trips through the washer and dryer, they've shrunk, and feel uncomfortably tight, especially around my ankle.  They're still comfortable in shoes, but I limit how long I have them on because of the restrictive feeling.",4.0,0
"I have the standard Litter Genie, and I think it's the greatest! I don't understand the negative reviews--in one, it almost sounds like the person was trying to empty their whole litter box into the Genie. Cleaning the litter box will never be a pleasant experience (until my cat starts pooping gold nuggets!), but Litter Genie makes the process neat and easy. I simply use the provided scoop, pick the box clean, and ""flush"" the collection down into the collection bag. No problems and no odor! I am very sensitive to litter box odor, and there has been none since I got my Litter Genie.
Replacing the bags is a breeze, too. Inside the compartment is a cutter--simply pull the bag down from the refill so there is enough to tie a knot in the top of the filled bag. Remove the filled bag. Then, make your new bag by simply tying a firm knot in the cut end of the plastic, forming the bottom of your new bag. Pull down enough material to fill the compartment, close the container, and you're done.

I have one, and occasionally two, cats inside and two litter boxes. Even with two cats, one bag will last me 2-3 weeks. I use natural corncob litter, which is easy to scoop. Very little unused litter gets into my Litter Genie. I don't find it necessary to use a hack for the replacement bags. The refills are reasonably priced since I don't have to change the bag every day (like some reviewers said they were doing). It's easy to carry the Litter Genie between litter boxes because there is a convenient carrying opening on the back, near the top. I have never had trouble with it coming apart while I was carrying it.

"Picked this up with Amazon and am totally impressed for TomTom's bottom of the line GPS. Having owned the GO 300 and selling that I have had the chance to play with this for a while. The screen is about twice as bright as the 300, about 1/3 the weight. The battery lasts about half of the 300s but as long as you can use the cigerette lighter thats not a problem. The speaker is surprisingly loud (louder than Garmin Nuvi 660, Magellan 3410 among others). The window mount is built very cheaply but you don't need a lot of strength as the ONE is very light. The features are light on this unit, no text to speech, bluetooth,etc but for what you need this is a terrific GPS. The touchscreen is very responsive compared to the Magellan.

"Normally I have good luck with my purchases. I generally do my research and buy well made products. I bought one of these units and used it successfully for six months. During that time it kept my tropical aquarium at a solid 78F.

One morning, I went to feed my fish and the water was much warmer than normal. I checked the thermometer and it read 90F, luckily my fish were all still alive. I turned the heater knob down to 70 and allowed the water to cool down on its own. After several hours it held 82. I hadn't done a water change in nearly a week so it's not that I let the water level drop.

No big deal, these things happen. Luckily these heaters have a lifetime warranty. I contacted Aqueon by email and received no response. I sent another one a week later, and no response. I couldn't find a phone number for them.

Look, sometimes heaters malfunction. A manufacturer can do all they can to prevent it and back it up with a guarantee. But if they don't stand by their own guarantee or even answer your emails, it isn't a crap product; it's a crap company.

If you are going to buy an Aqueon heater, I recommend the Aqueon Pro instead of this one. They are better units in my experience. Otherwise, have a look at the Eheim Jager, or Fluval offerings.",3.0,0

I probably should give this 5 stars because my Cockatiel ADORES this toy. These are her favorite. I got her in June and I have already ordered 3 of them. She loves ripping them apart and they are the only toy she really shows interest in at all. They also are just the size I was looking for to hang under a rope perch on the top of her cage where I've designed her a little play area. I use the perch as sort of a bridge and this toy is short enough to hang underneath and not touch the cage so she can swing it around and chew it up. I wish I could find them locally because the reason I gave it four stars was the 2nd time I ordered I ordered two since she tears them up so quickly and one came just fine but the other one was missing pieces one of the wicker balls was just in pieces in the bottom of the box and a couple pieces of the colored wood were laying in the box as well. She already tears them up pretty quickly and having it already missing pieces definitely makes it last even less time. It was aggravating to me because the toys came in a box from Amazon with other items I had ordered at the same time and all were individually packaged within the cardboard box except these two toys which were just thrown in with nothing but a tag saying Super Bird Creations. No bag around them no cardboard nothing just thrown in the bottom of the box and the one was damaged. It is still a good toy though and your bird will love it just be prepared to buy them in bulk ;),4.0,0
"Just switched my cat to this food and he really likes it. He's eating it more than the Purina One Beyond he upgraded from. The vet suggested to give him Innova Evo or Blue Buffalo which are both excellent foods but he didn't like them and he actually dropped down to 9.5 lbs. He's slowly gained weight back after switching to Purina One Beyond but I wanted to buy something that was a great quality food rather than the supermarket junk he likes. Purina One Beyond is better quality than Friskies or something but still not the quality I want my pets to eat.

He is now 10.6 lbs and rising so I'm hoping that he'll eventually get up to the 12 lbs that the vet wanted him at to be ideal weight (he's a large breed cat).

Price was $3 more expensive than the Purina, so he gets a 5 star food at a great price!
I noticed that other reviewers said their cats' poop smelled horrible after eating this but Ziggy's poop doesn't smell horrible or strong at all. Probably just depends on your cat I guess.

"I have always liked Wacom products and that includes its Bamboo styluses. The one I have used before just had a pen clip which actually worked well for my iPad case. I have always liked the styluses that are able to plug into the headphone/speaker port because I don't use it often so I it makes sense to have a solid place to keep my stylus with my iPad.

This product is reminiscent of the elago, which also has the retractable and speaker port pen feature. It also includes some colored rings that you can swap out for customization, though I think the silver looks the cleanest and most expensive.

The functionality is fine. It writes well and fits in your hand well. I'm just not a big fan of the girth of the product but it does allow for better grip and writing. However, the rubber grip does make the product look a bit cheaper, as it has dots in them and holds onto lint and dirt strongly and easily.

For the price, I think the elago is a much cheaper and comparable option. This product just doesn't look as sleek and clean as the other styluses in both elago or Wacom's repertoire.",3.0,0

"So far I've put up 4 of the cameras, and it works pretty well. The picture on the monitor is of good quality, both night and day. I've been very impressed by the quality of night vision through these cams.

When I'm at home and my phone is connected to the home wifi, I can see the cams (both the grid, and each individual cam) on my phone just fine. I have NEVER, however, been able to access these images remotely, as was claimed in the description. (At LEAST one star off for that, as that's one of the main things I wanted to be able to do.) If somebody helps me be able to do that, I'll be glad to add back at least another star.

At least one of the cables failed, which MAY have been partly my fault, but it just seems like they're pretty brittle and easily damaged. (Maybe really thin wire? Not sure.)

I added a 2TB surveillance hard drive, and getting all of that hooked up was rather simple - no problems there.

I was able to go rewind and see who got into my garage trash can (neighborhood stray dog), and we feel like just having the cams up is deterring whomever MIGHT have been getting stuff out of our garage freezer.

"You can wear the hood by itself, wear it with the hood, or wear just the jacket without the hood.  How is that for 3-in-1 systems?

Reminiscent of what Lands End sells as a ""Squall Jacket"", or what uniform and corporate wear sellers call a Three Season Jacket.

Water and wind resistant shell.  Microfleece lined body.  Smooth polyester lining in sleeves.  Left hand side, Napoleon style, inside pocket with a hook and loop closure.  Adjustable sleeve cuffs.  Hemline cinch cord with toggles.  Molded plastic chain style, off brand, slide fastener.

Polyester insulation is spilling out due to poor quality stitching.  Item was delivered with a broken main zipper.

I can wear this jacket over just a t-shirt, and expect to stay warm @ 72 degrees Fahrenheit, and no wind.

If it was foggy, or there's a light drizzle, I would have no problem depending on this jacket to go 300 - 500 feet in order to get to my car in the parking lot.

Better garments feature Gore-Tex, Hippora, HyVent, DWR.....this jacket features no technology.  You're just hoping that the polyester does not saturate as you're trying to get where you're going.  You will not be going for bike rides, checking your property's fence line by horseback, riding a motorcycle, playing golf, pier fishing, lap dancing, picking strawberries, calling ducks, or anything else in the rain.

I guess if you name your company, 32Degrees Weatherproof, the customer does not have a reasonable expectation that your garments will keep them dry & warm.

Garment fits tight across the shoulders, back, chest, and arms.  Go 1 size up if you intend on layering.

I've purchased other items from this manufacturer, and frankly, this item was a let down.  It's not warm enough when I need it to be warm.  I put on a few layers, and it is too tight.  I need to stay dry, and I'm sooooo wet.

The piano plays pre-set songs, or tracks of songs, rather than notes, so children have to listen thru before they engage again.  Would have preferred individual sounds as (at least) an option.

"I actually ordered the Litter Genie by mistake and let it sit for months. Now that I am using it I find the whole process annoying. This review should focus on the refills. It would be so much better if they came pre-sized with strongly sealed bottoms, perforated to separate and start a new one so all we have to do is push the refill down into the chamber. The whole size guessing, having to try to balloon out the plastic in the bottom to guess what length to cut then tie a secure knot in the bottom and hope you have performed all steps well enough so no blow-outs upon removal is vexing. The built in cutter works smoothly so scissors aren't needed. I am refraining from commenting on the entire device but can't separate  the two that easily. It might be better if the refills were better designed. I have a large cat with large urine clumps. They don't fit in the scoop and are ~too large to dump in the top. I use hard clumping scoopable litter. I wonder how messy it must be with old-fashioned clay, pine pellets or other media? I get tired of used litter scattering about during transfer, on the floor, the handles, the lip of the entrance and such.
I plan to use up the refills and donate this thing because my old large efficient sturdy scoop+ brown paper lunch bags collected into repurposed bags works better and is cheaper.
How about odor? I haven't quizzed friends but should. I am concerned because my cat has stopped defecating in his box since this was added and it is the ONLY change. Is it odor or something else that is distressing him? 40+ yrs as a cat owner and veterinary professional has me looking at all issues.

"The Problem:
Samsung Galaxy Tab comes with ridiculously short charging cable.

The Solution:
Juiced Systems Extra Long Charging Cable.

I've received this dual charging cable as well as the Juiced Systems standard extra long Galaxy Tab cable and they are both great.  With this dual Galaxy Tab & Micro USB cable, I can charge both my Tab Plus 7.0 and Galaxy Nexus phone at the same time with just one cable.  This will be my go-to travel cable.

Juiced Systems also really supports their products and customers.  They were extremely responsive to email questions and when I had a small issue with one of the initial cables I received, and they sent me a replacement cable almost instantly.  Can't say enough good things about their customer service.

So if you have a Galaxy Tablet, this is the solution you should look to.  I will warn you that other extended cables for the Tab may not charge with enough current to maintain a charge while using your Tab.

"If you replace the pump with a Whisper 10 air pump or something more powerful than the pump that comes with the Whisper 3i filter, then you have a serviceable little, low profile filter. Puts out about 25 gallon per hour then. I coupled it with an Azoo Mignon 60 HOB compact power filter. I had several others where I also switched out the pump. (Use for airstone or sponge filter.).  Because I have a lip on one the tanks, I had to modify the attachment system.  I cut and shaped a length of plastic coated wire hanger into 2 S hooks. I coated the exposed metal ends with aquarium sealer. Then I drilled 2 holes, spaced 2 inches apart in the upper back of the filter housing.  Place the S hooks through the holes and hang of over the lip of your tank.  Be sure and measure for correct desired water level. Final touch. Put a suction cup on the lower stud of the filter back. Be sure to clean the area of the tank wall where the suction cup is to be placed. Stiff, coated auto or household electrical wire will also work for making the attachment hooks. Now the formerly deficient filters work great. They use a minute amount of space and now have more suction and outflow. Be sure to occasionally clean the hole where the airline meets the uptake tube.

"The Garmin ""Bluecharts"" are vector charts, which means they use mathematic algorithms to store all the lines and features of a nautical chart.  I have steered away from these in the past because they tended to give up a lot of detail vs. ""Raster Graphic"" charts, which are essentially photographic images of paper charts.
With ""Bluecharts"" they have gotten to a level of detail (including multiple colors) that they look almost as good as a paper charts.  The advantages of vector charts is that they take up much less room on your hard drive and run much faster on a PC.  This is important when you are zooming in and out to see your depth or proximity to a wreck while moving on a boat.
I use mine with an eTrex Legend and am able to load most of the detail (depth, obstructions, nautical aids, etc) onto the handheld.  For the full look of charts, I connect the GPS unit to my laptop.  The package also includes tidal charts, which are much more detailed and accurate than the little tide chart booklets I used to use. Overall, it makes navigation a breeze...your boat is automatically represented on the chart and you have many simple tools to calculate distance/time to a given destination.  It also incorporates additional information on Marinas and service locations.
The Garmin application the charts run on, ""MapSource"" allows you to easily switch between map types.  I have ""Americas Bluechart,"" ""MetroGuide"" (streetmaps), and ""Tides and Marine Services,"" all without having to reconnnect the GPS unit.
The only hassle is the ""Unlock"" process, which is a bit time consuming and involves providing the Garmin website with a bunch of codes, including the serial number of my GPS unit to unlock a set of charts from the CD-ROM.  I'm not sure, but I think it will only work with that specific unit, which worries me a bit as I am thinking about buying a second unit for backup.",5.0,0

"This dres arrived dirty and extremely wrinkled, I know for a fact this item was returned by a previous owner or it was used on some kind of display. I received the dress the day before I needed it for my daughter so I could not return it in time to get another one. It had brown make up on parts of the dress, which I had to clean with make up remover and baby wipes.

The dress was extrely wrinkled due to the fact that the dress was STUFFED back into it's packaging. So I had to give it a good steaming job before it even stared to look decent. The same previous owner must have reinforced the flower appliques on the dress with a hot glue gun because there were dried glue strings hanging from the flowers.

The quality of the dress: it was ok considering that it is a child's play dress. Compared to other children at my daughter's school who also wore princess dresses, this one held up a day of playing, running, swinging, rolling of the ground/grass much better than the others.

My daughter did not complain of anything being itchy on the inside, which I was thankful for. I say that because the tulle fabric overlay on the outside is very stiff, as if it was treated/sprayed with a fabric stiffener or something.

The back of the dress has a little circle velcro closure piece that does not stick very well.

"This camera bag is great!  If you have a mirror-less set up it would be ideal.  For a regular sized DSLR maybe not so much.  I bought this to replace my AW150 slingshot, which as a big guy...is a horrible backpack.  I really like this backpack, but the camera compartment is too cramped.  I will be returning it and getting the larger version for the extra camera room.

Pros:
-You can definitely fit a 11"" Macbook Air and an Ipad (at the same time) in the front compartment, there are two separate pockets.
-Side pockets are super nice for a bottle.
-The removable camera compartment makes it a fully usable backpack.
-It comes with a bunch of Velcro inserts for the camera compartment so you can configure it how you want.
-The waist strap is big.  easily over 50"" when fully extended.  The chest strap too is pretty generous

Cons
-The camera compartment is small.  It can hold my DSLR (Old T3i with 18-55 kit lens)) and barely a 55-250 lens. The camera wouldn't fit at all with the larger lens attached.
-If anything protrudes even slightly above the top of the camera compartment you can feel it in your back.
-The side pouches are pretty useless as a tripod holder.

It seemed to fit about the same as most standard ladies hats of this type, possibly a little looser as I have a big head and tend to find most hats slightly small until they have been broken in and stretched. This fit well from the get-go. There is a slight amount of adjustability (there's a velcro closure by the bow on the back) but not much. The construction on it is solid and seems like it will hold up to a lot of wear - already been through the wash once after being thrown in a mud puddle and stepped on by my toddler, and it still looks good as new. I purchased the dark violet color - it's definitely not violet, more of a light tweedy brown - BUT it is the exact color that it shows on the computer screen. So ignore the words and go off of the picture :) Huge brim is great for the beach, reading, gardening, or just everyday wear to protect your face from the sun. Please note, the brim does NOT extend all the way around the back. It almost gives this hat more of a bonnet look than the oversized sun hats one often thinks of.

"These fit well. They tuck well. They definitely make hot weather easier to manage if you wear multiple layers.
My two complaints:
1) The collar is sized in a manner that often you are left feeling the tag of your outer shirt on your neck, which can be annoying, especially if you are wearing sunscreen. Sometimes this collar will ""roll up"" too. I assume this is from the type of material used.
2) Due to the material of the shirt, your outer shirt tends to come untucked, ballooning much sooner into your work day. This, again, is likely due to the material of the shirt, as there is minimal friction between the undershirt and the outer shirt. This untucking is exacerbated if your outer shirt happens to be moisture wicking (low friction at the underside, usually).
While I really do appreciate what these shirts do, I cannot imagine spending the same amount of money on another two. If the price was a bit less, then yes. However, for the money, there are a plethora of other brands that have extremely similar materials (literally two sides of the same coin at this juncture of clothing technology), that likely perform just as well. Since it is an undershirt, how much does brand really matter? IF brand does matter to you, then know these do what they advertise, but come with a few caveats.",4.0,0

"What can I say? I'm a 5'6"" 40-something eventer with big horses and having a mounting block sure makes setting and resetting fences much easier.  I used to have a three-step block and unfortunately, the friend to whom I loaned it managed to break it (yep, really!).  So, missing my block, I ordered this one.  At first, I missed having that top third step, but after a week or so, I got used to it.
What I like:  Stability.  I have a youngster who is learning to stand still for mounting, and this block has a nice, wide base, so it doesn't move around easily.  I can get on and off 20 times, holding a fidgety youngster, and this block never threatens to tip over.  The steps themselves are plenty wide enough to allow for standing (not just stepping) on them.  The handle is built into the front instead of the back, which makes the block easier to pick up.  While substantial enough in weight, it's light enough to pick up and carry across the arena in one hand (while leading a horse with the other hand) without any real effort.

What I don't like:  I wish it were about 2"" taller.  Also, the recessed area on the back side (not visible in the product photos on Amazon) will make a very attractive nesting location for yellowjackets - a better design would be a straight side all the way down the back.  And finally, the steps are either slightly warped or designed to have a slight depression in the middle of each step.  This means the mounting block collects water and must be tipped off before using after a rainstorm.  I suspect this is a design element to enhance step stability, but the problem of water collection could be eliminated by drilling a small hole in the middle of the depression (I may do this myself).",4.0,0
"This is SOOOO cute  I know, it's a footie onesie, big deal.  The colors are so rich and vibrant, and they did not fade or bleed into other items in the wash.  This is 100% organic cotton, which means it is very gently on baby, and gentle on the environment as well.  The dyes are even natural!
The snaps are secure, but easy to close, and the legs snap all the way down to the foot, so it's a lot easier to put on and take off of little squirmy ones.  There are little foldover fabric covers for baby's hands to keep him/her from scratching, so you can eliminate the little mittens that don't seem to stay on.  The company guarantees satisfaction with their product, and this comes in numerous colors and several different sizes.  Since this is all cotton, there may be a bit of shrinkage, I didn't really see any, but I only washed and dried once in order to use the first time.  Since it's cotton, you can wash at high temps to completely sanitize though!!  I did receive a discount on this purchase in exchange for testing and providing an honest review for the Amazon community.",5.0,0

"I've now had this TV for a year. It has been nothing short of a nightmare. I have a sony ps3 and an iPhone. Streaming to it from the phone is hit or miss. My internet is well over spec for this to function but it barely ever does. Most days we decide to watch something on the TV it just doesn't want to work.  The playstation is wired to it and gets unrecognized by the TV so often and decides not to work anymore. Yes my ps3 works just fine on real tvs. It's updated as much as it can be. There is just no reason to make such a dumb product as this. Why can't it just be a TV and play whatever I play on it? Sony has killed my enthusiasm for all things entertainment. When it works, the image and sound are fantastic. If you don't mind being let down 6 out of ten times you try using it, that might work for you.

I'm writing this now because I thought at first it was my inexperience with this kind of product that caused issue. But the internet and streaming technology can't be blamed for the issues with sony's own gaming console.  zero stars.",1.0,0

"My favorite game of all time!  This game is so much fun for adults and kids alike. Some of the younger kids might need a little help but most of them were able to do just fine. You can even always make sure kids get the villager card. I strongly recommend watching a demonstration on youtube on how to play this. (The game seems complicated but don't be afraid. The  best part is that you don't have to memorize anything that the characters do - the narrator tells you as you're playing. )  We tell the kids that they are allowed to lie when they play the game and it kind of worries them to lie at first but then they really get into it and have a lot of fun. :)

You also use the one night ultimate Werewolf free app with this, that narrates the game for you as you go. You can customize it on the app as much as you'd like, including music, the voice, and you can decide which characters to activate during the game. You can also slow the game down significantly for kids or for those learning to play the first time. You can actually download the one night ultimate werewolf app before you buy the game to kind of check it out. Best. Game.",5.0,0

"Well, I've had this tripod for 4 months now. I hoped (like many others) that it was a solid aluminum beast, but the truth is, it isn't. It's mostly hard black plastic. The plastic is OK, but it broke on me on the plastic where the legs connect to the central member.

I purchased a Dolica Proline at the same time as this one. So far it has been a better, more durable tripod (overall).

This one out-performs the Dolica if it's being used for shooting videos though.

The Sony name is good, but this product is relatively brittle. I would recommend it only for someone who will use it for light-duty purposes.

1) Added emergency Events. These are cards you pull that create a little more chaos in your game.
2) the Hinterlands challenge- we haven't played this one yet. About animal outbreaks as well?
3) THE SUPERBUG CHALLENGE!!! This is awesome. There is a 5th (purple) disease and to win you must CURE & ERADICATE the 5th disease and well as cure the 4 original ones. But it is also harder to cure the purple disease and you treat it differently than the originals. Super fun.

There are also quarantine chips. These are a cool addition and can be added at any time. They really help with the superbug challenge.

"Sometimes it is so hard to find a loose comfortable tank top. So often they are tight fitting, so I was happy to find the vintage cool loose fit tank top with ettellut hair band.
I ordered this in blue size medium. I normally wear a size small but reviews said this ran small so I figured I would go up one size. The color is a faded blue almost but very pretty. This is a very light weight soft material. It is rather see through so I would suggest maybe wearing it with a sporty sports bra. This tank is a razor back style and very cute.  The color was exactly how it looked in the picture.
I am glad I opted for the medium cause this does appear to run small. This material is very thin, the shirt seems to be stitched well and that it may hold up stitching wise but the material seems so thin I am not sure how long it will hold up. It seems almost like an old shirt you have had for years. I do like that about it cause it makes it very light weight, which is great sometimes in the summer heat.
This came with a complementary hair tie in black. That was really nice it is stretchy and appears to be good quality, and did not stretch out beyond use the first time I used it. I hate hair ties that you can only use once.
I like that this tank is so versatile. It can be worn with jeans, shorts, or even yoga pants and still looks great. You can really even use it as a bathing suit cover if you would like.

"We did Christmas a week early with one side of the family, and this was literally the ONLY toy (besides paper and boxes) our VERY active 21-month-old played with at all, and he sat with it for at least half an hour in one sitting.  It took him several tries to figure out how to get the coins into the slots and get his fingers out of the way.  It would admittedly be easier if they were open slots to drop into instead of having to the circles that barely fit the coins, since clumsy toddler fingers make it a bit difficult, but he eventually figured it out.  He's a toddler, though, so he doesn't make it every time, and it sometimes frustrates him.

Some things you might not be able to see from the photos and description:
>The coin slot at the top drops the coins into the coin return on the left.  You can watch the coin slide down via a ""track"" in the back.
>The yellow display at the top is actually button that changes the ""display"" (it's just a roll with images on it) every time you press it.
>Once you stack up the coins in the register, you have to swipe a ""credit card"" through the slot on top of the drawer to make them all drop into the drawer.

However, the auto-off function is a deal breaker, so this is going back.  I have battery powered Bluetooth speakers that don't have this ""feature""; why Polk decided to include it in an AC powered speaker makes no sense.  Further, when I power the speaker on, it doesn't automatically connect to the last known device.  I have to go back to my iMac every time and tell it to connect to the speaker.

Also, I haven't been able to keep the Airplay connection working for more than a few minutes.  I suppose this could be due to any number of factors, so I can't put this squarely on Polk, but that was one of the primary reasons I selected this particular model.",2.0,0

watching it lay there and breathe like a real sleeping puppy. She would just stand and watch it for hours. Over the years, she
has loved this little puppy named, ""Honey"". During all her visits over the years, it was one of her favorites. It finally stopped working,
and we could not fix it. My Grand-daughter said if I ever found another one, she would really love to have it for her own.
I found it here on Amazon. The exact one that she wanted.
I just gave this Puppy to her on her 10th birthday, and she is thrilled. She lost her real dog, so this sleeps on her bed with her
at night. It came in it's own adorable Puppy bed, with a brush, a tagged collar, and real adoption papers to fill out. She is thrilled.

"I bought this especially for the backlit feature so I can find the buttons in the dark. Unfortunately, the backlight only stays on a few seconds after you press any button. There is a dedicated button on the left side, separate from the normal button group, that will activate the backlight, but it's hard to find and press it. The result is that you take a chance pressing another button on the front panel just to get the light turned on.  Safest way is to nudge the volume button, since that one is easy to find and hard to mistake for another button.  It would be a better design to have an easy to use front button to turn on the light and keep it on a little longer.

"Mounted this on the back of my 32 foot camper. Used their 50 foot extension cable and mounted the transmitter on the front of the camper. It takes a couple of seconds for the GPS to switch to the backup camera, but after my 3 and 1/2 week vacation that we just got back from, and about 3000 miles, this thing saved my butt several times.

The camera is a fish eye, so mounted at a 45 degree angle, I can see the whole back of my camper, and up into the sky, and several car widths to both sides of the back of my camper.  I was also amazed at how you can adjust the guide lines to fit your rig, raise them up, down, and spread them apart or closer together so they perfectly fit your use.  If want, you can remove the guide lines with a simple checkmark in my GPS, but with being able to adjust them so much, I would not know why anyone would want to turn them off.

"I have UAG cases for my iPhone and iPad mini. Given my positive experience with them, it was a no-brainer to get one for the iPad Pro. Their version for the 9. 7"" model is attractive, light, but well-engineered, useful, and protective like all the UAG cases I own. I like the dark blue because it isn't another all black case but it isn't an overly flashy color either. I like to cruise just under the radar but still have some style. ;)

Functionally, the case fits well, all ports and buttons are easy to access, it is well protected both opened and especially when closed, and the FrogSkin cover is easy to grip and simple to clean. The cover is easily adjustable and the stand can be detached, it is compatible with a keyboard, it has a ""Smart"" cover to put the device in sleep mode, and there is a stylus holder (see photo).

"A cute little plush critter with a biiig mouth a happy grin, and a real Elmo voice (just like on Sesame Street)  -- this Gund Nursery Rhyme Elmo Sound Toy ...  is endearing and cute to look at --- as he sits there, book in hand, big grin on mouth. Flick the switch on his tusch, squeeze his left foot and Elmo reads you a Cute Little Poem, one of 5. ""Do you want Elmo to read you ANOTHER poem?"" he then says -- Well, It took us a while to realize that Shouting ""YES!!! "" was not the way to hear another poem (LOL) but SQUEEZING his left foot IS the way to entice him to recite them, one at a (foot squeeze) time. His diction is FLAWLESS. He also makes cute and pertinent comments about each poem, which is delightful to adult and child. Kids can recite the poem(s) with him. (if you don't want to hear another poem Elmo apologetically says ""OK Maybe Later, Bye Bye!""

The book he is holding has drawings on it that illustrate the poems -- ""Twinkle Twinkle Little Star"", ""Humpty Dumpty"", ""Mary Had a Little Lamb"". ""The Itsy Bitsy Spider"", and Hickory Dickory Dock"". All of this is CUUUTE. So is Nursery Rhyme Elmo. Cute, with floppy little fuzzy legs, but not totally cuddly as his inner workings and his mouth are made of Hard Stuff and he has a hard butt -- so, carrying him around would be fun for a kid, but I doubt close-cuddling would be very enticing.

However, this is a cuuute toy and each poem invites dialogue and the use of imagination between parent and kid or between siblings .",4.0,0

"but, then, I realized that it has no memory expandability, a small screen, and a non-replaceable battery. I wondered why. Then, I happened upon the Aiptek A-HD+ 1080P which had all those features and more. It weighs a tiny bit more, but gives much more bang for the buck. A little bit cheaper too. Not as sexy though. Anyway, I bought the Aiptek and that's that. It's well worth considering. Just a tip, IMHO.

Update to post 7/7/08: I was rightfully admonished about giving the Mino a rating without having used it. thank you for the feedback. I need to qualify my statements above by saying that my 3 star rating was based only on the Mino's features vs. its inherent limitations. That is the only basis for my rating. For what it's worth by the way, the Aiptek is great and running 720p at 60 fps. It could run at 1080p, but I haven't tried it yet. It's a very nice camera with a very good picture.

"These cheater plugs are great. I ended up buying these cheater plugs because I needed a pair of earrings that I can wear daily and won't poke me in the neck or fall out because of a cheap backing. These earrings fit all of my requirements; they have a nice screw-on back and they are identical front and back so no more neck poking. These cheaters do look like the real thing as well. They fit well and I forget I'm wearing them because they are so comfortable. These are made of surgical steel and feel very well made and seem as though they will hold up well over daily use.

It is important to note that the posts on these are larger than the average stud post so you may have to work to get them in the first time around. Normal earring posts are usually 18g these are 16g.

Edit: After being so pleased with these cheaters I went ahead and purchase this same style in the other colors (black, purple, blue, green and the plain silver ones) I love all of them just as much as my this rose gold one. The colors are all true to the pictures and they all are well made. One thing I should mention is the plain silver pair has a slightly longer post than the rest but it doesn't really bother me.

"Don't believe what this product description says:  These are very nice clippers, but NOT for a small dog, and definitely not for cats.  These clippers are suitable for large dogs.  The blades are wide, so--when open wide--they don't fit between my small dog's toenails and threaten to bite into his pads.

But, for large dogs, this is a nice pair of clippers:  Very sharp blades, nicely beveled; the blades close smoothly, and the handles are easy to grip--if you have large hands.

I have long fingers and these handles, while easy to close, are kind of hard for me to get my hand around.

SIZE INFORMATION:  I'm adding this information based on a question I received in the comment section:
""Refer to the second and third picture down: Opened up, the handles 4 11/16"" from outside edge to outside edge. A tape measure all the way around the open handle shows 11 1/8"". At the blade end: Opened up, 1 1/4"" outside-to-outside of blades; 7/16 inside-to-inside of blades.""

For your video files not worth a whole dvd, or to fit over 30 hours of 256k quality MP3s on one DVD, it does the job. Maybe with firmware it will get better.

"I purchased this to audit my office wireless network and it was well worth every penny. Using the Alfa AWUS036H I was able to decrypt our 128-bit WEP key within 45 minutes on the first attempt, and a mere 20 on the second attempt. I knew WEP was insecure, but even though the AP was set to use MAC address filtering and no broadcast SSID, I was able to collect enough information to decrypt the WEP key and authenticate to the network. Needless to say, the office wireless has since been upgraded with an access point that supports WPA-PSK2 with AES. WEP offers little to no security, and this device can help you prove that to anyone making purchasing decisions, or even to yourself if you're a skeptic.

The Alfa AWUS036H is also good to carry around if you travel a lot and need the extra power and range (hotel wireless networks typically have a high noise threshold) to get a more stable signal. I use it with a 6 ft. USB extension cable to find the best location for signal reception. This device provides better reception than wireless adapters costing several dollars more and is an indispensable tool for wireless security auditing, I highly recommend it.

Our Border Collie/ Australian Shepherd mix expends tons of energy running around pushing it all around the yard like crazy, frequently changing directions. Some days it is actually her primary form of exercise, she loves it so much.

"The keyboard has a cheap, PC Jnr/ Speak n Spell toy game feel. The biggest problem is the function keys are pre programmed and override all functions you normally use them for. For example the F1 key overrides ALL previously programmed functions AND QUITS ANY OPEN APPLICATION when it's pressed. It's been close to an hour now I have had it plugged in and trying to search the internet and Apple websites to figure out how to override Macally's function keys. If you find this inconvenience tolerable and the feel of a toy keyboard is ok, then by all means go for it.

Upon receipt of additional info not immediately discernible in the instructions that came with the keyboard, my headache about the function keys is now solved. Apparently it was simply a matter of pressing the FN key and the Up or Down arrows to change function key functionality. I'm most grateful to the folks at Macally for their assistance. I am now adjusting my review and will recommend the keyboard to you - if you have no problems with the cheap keyboard feel. The keyboard itself works as it should, the keys are low profile but provide good tactile feedback response when pressed. I also should mention the keyboard comes with a cool Macally mouse - which works really great. So, to sum it up in pros and cons
Cons: Cheap, toy feel
  Instructions were not as clear as they could have been - I was not able to understand from the instructions that the FN and up and down arrow keys toggle functionality. Maybe it was my poor understanding, but I felt it could have been made more plain

Pros: Good tactile feedback response from all keys
  Useful Function keys functionality
  Comes with a 3 button optical mouse",4.0,0
"This is a classy looking watch.  I don't get much opportunity to ""dress up"" these days, and its nice to have an inexpensive watch to have ""on reserve"" for those events where it does happen.  Typically I'm wearing my casio tough solar watch with a suit, and it doesn't look right (even if it is a good representation of ""the real me"").

Now with the Armitron I'll have an appropriate watch to wear ""occasionally"".

You may want to pick up a watch sizing kit, I have one because I'm buying most of my watches online these days. This is the one I have:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/GGI-International-WTK-037-Metal-Watch-Repair-Kit/dp/B00K7JSMOK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">GGI International WTK-037 Metal Watch Repair Kit</a>&nbsp;its very highly rated.  Its easier than taking your watch into a shop.  I live in a household of 6, so whenever anyone gets a watch I can just adjust it easily.

I think the lack of a calendar function is a huge plus.  Calendar functions never work that well, whenever you have a month that only has 30 days then your calendar is ""off"" and you have fiddle with it.  There are so many other ways for me to know the proper date, like my cell phone and my computer, that I don't need my watch to provide that information.  just the time is fine.

The fit is comfortable.  The red color is pleasing when worn with dressy or dressy casual clothing.

The negatives:
1) the presentation box arrived damaged, which if you were going to give it as a gift would be undesirable.

Why didn't I give it 5 stars:  well, to do that it would have to have something about it that I thought was truly excellent and made it stand out in its field. Also at the time of this review it was not clear to me what the retail price is.  This is a very nice watch, and I like it, but I don't really know how good a value it is.  I'll come back later and update it if it comes back into stock.",4.0,0

"Clearly these boots were not for my feet, as I am not wearing men's boots any time soon. I got them for a staff member, who was wearing crummy cheap boots while he worked in our barn~ not acceptable. So, we bought him a pair in the style my husband wears. Ariat is the only brand we, as a boot wearing family, ever buy. So, once we got the boots, which was lickety split, of course, with Amazon Prime, we had Vid try them on. They fit exactly the way they are intended. They fit as though your foot is poured into a boot mold. haha. Of course, if they fit correctly, they should be a bit tight the first few times, they weather slowly, and fit your foot, well, like a glove.
These were exactly what we had hoped, and Vid was extremely grateful, smiled all day. We are pleased that our staff member finally knows what a quality boot should be, and we're confident he's as comfortable as he can be while he works. That makes everyone happy. Even the horses. Wink.",5.0,0
"Installation was a snap.  However, I purposely purchased another pioneer deck to replace my existing one thinking I would not have to rewire the harness.  I was wrong.  Pioneer kept the same connector type but changed the wires around.

But installation snafus aside this 70 dollar deck sounds better than the 300 dollar pioneer deck it replaced.  Fewer fancier options but solid power out and the highs, mids and lows are solid.

AUX in works like a champ with IPOD or any other mp3 player for that matter.

Not a big fan of the RED lighting on the unit but it is not a deal breaker for me.  If you are looking for a deck to push your speakers and on a budget like me... look no further this deck is NICE.",5.0,0

"This is a lovely watch, and dressier than it looks in the photo due to the tiny (66) Swarovski crystals set in the bezel. The band, described as ""blush pink"" is ceramic (I'm not sure most people looking at it would know that) and definitely just slightly tinted--much more flattering to pale skin, I think, than a white band. The face, including the bezel, is about the size of a quarter--a nice size for either a small or large wrist--and is a slightly deeper pink. Very pretty..

One reason I love AK watches is because they have an extender and always fit. This one is slightly smaller than others I have which means that, for me, it fits better than usual when I take out the extender. For someone who finds it usually too loose with the extender out, this may be the perfect fit. Likewise, if it's usually a little snug with the extender in, this might be too tight. Overall, I think with the extender, they've got it right for most people.

Someone said the bracelets were tight. For comparison, here's this: I need to remove the extender to get the watch to fit and the bracelets (pretty accents in the three different shades--silver, gold and rose gold) have about 1"" of space left when they're on. They're oval, not circular, and I think they would fit most people who would be wearing the watch, with or without an extender.  The bracelets also each have a removable extender (hook with your fingernail and pull it open to remove it--no tools required). If I needed more room on the watch, honestly, I'd attach one of these extenders. Not a perfect match, but close enough that I don't think anyone would ever notice it. So, with three bracelets, that makes the sizing of this very versatile even for someone who normally would expect a watch like this to be much too small.

All in all, it's a very pretty watch and being so easily adjustable is also a real plus.",5.0,0
"I've used this product for many years for my dogs, to try to keep the fleas away. I never realized until recently that I wasn't following the dosage correctly. I was mistakenly using only 1 per day. They say to use 2 per 10 lbs. pet's weight. So, now I'm on track with it, and it couldn't have come at a better time, because fleas have been rampant this year in the mid-Atlantic that I've seen some feral kitens die because of the infestation.

The build quality is good, but it is made entirely of lightweight plastic.  It is mostly correct, except the poseable arms are a little off. They do not retract inside the robot and instead stick out. It's not a big deal. The robot is about 10"" tall, but you can raise the head to make it about 11"".

The robot includes 3 cheap AAA trial batteries. I immediately replaced them with Alkalines. They are accessed from the bottom of the robot, and a screwdriver is required.  The power switch is also on the bottom. Options are: Off, Play, and Trial. Dialogue is triggered by pushing the robot's power pack on the side. Push it once, and it says one the robot's popular phrases. Hold the button for a few seconds, and it will go thru all the robot's dialogue. If I counted correctly, there are 15 phrases.  The LED lights look very cool.

All around, I like this little robot. Is it a little overpriced?  Perhaps. It still looks cool on my desk though.",4.0,0
"The original thing that caught my eye was the chain. I saw it on a website and ordered the same pair.  The chain itself is very small, and the inside of the chain is stretched out.  It's a little thin, but it's not too big.  The chain itself is very pretty, and the color is a very pretty blue.  I've had the chain for a few months now, and I think it's going to last a long time.  The material is very light, and the color is very vibrant.  I haven't had it in a while, but I'm sure I'll be getting it in the next couple of weeks.  The reason I bought this pair was because the sizing is off.  I didn't like the color at all, and it's not the best looking chain I've ever had.  I'm still wearing it, but I don't really like it.  It's pretty cute, but I'm not sure how it'll hold up.

I'm 5'4"", 130lbs, and I ordered a large.  It fit perfectly, and I ordered a large in a large.  I don't think it will hold up to washing, but it's definitely a little snug.  I bought a small and it fit fine.  It is a bit small for my liking, but it still works well for",5.0,1

"These fit comfortably, no binding or anything anywhere, form fitting but not tight when sitting or bending.

The side pockets without buttons are handy, I like the slid in slot for a cell phone, but the rest of the pockets are mostly useless for me.  The front pockets are deeper than I'd prefer, and I've never been a fan of buttons on pockets.  The buttons on the back I just leave unbuttoned, since I only have a wallet I put back there, and the main pockets on the sides of the shorts I don't even use, just the smaller pockets for the cell phone.

The other downside is that the material is just a little too light for my taste.  I haven't had any issues with these, but I had a similar pair and last summer simply bumping against the rounded handle of my lawnmower's plastic push control was enough to split them in front of the pocket, not even in a seam, but in the middle of a panel.  These are a light, thin material like those were, so I'm going to be extra careful since I would prefer something a little more sturdy.

The color was rather darker than the picture showed as well - I like it, but if you're looking for something on the tanner side of the spectrum, these aren't the shorts you're looking for.

Belt is pretty much for display purposes only, I've never been a fan of this type of buckle.

They fit well though, and are comfortable.  I wish the material was a little thicker, but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and stick with four stars as long as they hold out.",4.0,0
"Our oldest cat of 10 years has been having some GI tract issues that were occasionally causing him to have bloody stool. Sprinkling this stuff on his food has really made a difference and has greatly reduced the frequency in which that happens. None of our cats bat an eye before chowing down when they see it sprinkled over their food, so it must taste pretty good to them.

With this latest box that we ordered we noticed that nearly half of the packs were not properly filled and contained much less Fortiflora than they should have, but within 2 hours of bringing it to the seller's attention they agreed to send us a replacement box from a different batch so I didn't let that affect my rating of the product since it has worked so well for us.

"At first I thought there was something wrong with this game.  After a couple minutes I realized the game can sense your hand movement behind the buttons also.  The trick is to not move the hand that you are holding it with or it will read a touch.  The game is so sensitive it can read your hand just hovering above the touch panels, and quite accurately.  After learning the trick I like it very much because you can light up the pattern much quicker than the old games.  The slide game works quite well.
The only thing about this game is wasn't crazy about is that I like classic Simon and the game will only use the left side of each color, pressing the other side will result in a buzz and lost game.
Overall I would say the the game is an improvement over the old hard press Simon games.",5.0,0

"This works wonderfully to play your music and it comes out very clear and loud.  Very easy to hook up and start using right away.  The light for the radio station is a little dim and in the sun it was hard to tell it was on.  For phone calls I honestly couldn't tell if the sound was coming out of my phone or the stereo until I hit mute on my stereo.  It was very hard to hear.  I tried several different calls and it was not working well but when I hung up and the music came back on nice volume.  It would have been fewer stars had I care about the call part of it.  I got this for my husband's car for road trips as his does not have aux or bluetooth and sometimes you can't get a station in or whatever reason and you want to hear music through the stereo speakers rather than the cell.

"I use this router at the receiving end of a wireless bridge between the two floors of my apartment, and also as a print and file server. I know this unit may be a bit of an overkill for the purpose, but I couldn't find any lower cost alternatives that would provide the same feature set.

I was a bit worried about the speeds I would get through the concrete floor, but the connection to the main router, an Apple Time Capsule, is rock stable at a 866 Mbps signal rate (the signal sits around 47-49 dB against a 92dB noise floor). The connection would stay up for months at a time.

I was pleasantly surprised that the stock firmware supported all the features I needed, but it's still nice to know that I can fall back to Merlin or DD-WRT if I need additional tweaking possibilities or special features. The performance and ease of use of the web GUI has also improved a lot compared to my previous Asus router, a WL500W. Being able to set most configuration items without a reboot is a godsend.

Another nice touch from Asus was providing a discovery utility, that finds the router on the LAN and detects its current IP address, which saved me a lot of time when I was tweaking the IP configuration of the two routers.

I cannot comment on the 2.4 GHz range or behavior, as I only use the router at 5 GHz.

Update (9/17/2014): I was having print server reliability issues with the stock firmware (after a few days the printer stopped printing, even though the router showed it was connected). So I installed DD-WRT, and I'm back to being a perfectly satisfied customer. Aside from the printer trouble, I only had to reboot the router for firmware updates and I never experienced any connection issues whatsoever.",5.0,0

"Our 3 year old golden retriever has softer fur, unlike our female whose coat is shinier and sleeker, so he tends to need to be bathed on a weekly basis to keep him smelling fresh and clean. He's like a little boy, he loves to explore and especially loves to jump in every puddle, pond, any body of water he sees basically which leaves his fur smelling what can best be described as fishy so I'm always looking for a great shampoo that won't irritate his sensitive skin.  This medicated dog shampoo has done absolute wonders for the dry, flaky skin both our goldens have on their front elbows.

"The company that supplied this ""used"" MBPr was extremely helpful. It wasn't really a used machine as far as I can tell. This came in the original box (more on that later) and shrunk wrapped.

When I placed the order, it wasn't supposed to arrive for 4-5 days. I contacted the seller and asked if they could please ship it quicker. I also mentioned I would pay whatever the additional charge would be. They replied quickly, had it delivered in two days (NY to NJ) and there was no additional charge.

I was thrilled. That is until I saw the laptop box. It was in bad shape. Not horrible, but one of the corners (and under the corner) was severely damaged. Crinkled and partially crushed. Enough so that it caused some concern about the laptops possible condition when I opened it. Turns out the laptop was in flawless condition, so no biggie. The box is still useable (although damaged) for eventual resale. I'm assuming the box was damaged BEFORE they sent it since the shipping box that contained the laptop and it's box was in great condition. Hmmm....

Anyway, it was listed as used, but there wasn't a scratch, ding or dent of any kind. Bottom line, I got a great machine with no damage for a great price with excellent customer service. No complaints. Just wish the laptop box wasn't damaged. That's the only reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5.

This is just my first impression of this particular car for anyone interested in getting one this size for the first time.

After about 10 minutes of this i gave up and sent it back. Like i said it just wasn't for me but that does not mean it's not for someone else.

"I bought these as a gift for my 20 year old son.  He is notoriously hard to buy shoes for.  Not only is he incredibly picky but he has wide feet and can not stand a tight fitting shoe  He would wear nothing but Sanuk's if he could but with snow on the ground, that is not very practical.

I purchased him both the Timberland Chestnut Ridge and these FRYE Dakota boots at the same time.  He tried both out around the house and decided to keep the FRYE.  The Timberlands were too narrow and the leather not nearly as supple as the FRYE, making the fit very uncomfortable.  He also thought the FRYE boot was just better looking overall.

After he wore the FRYE Dakota boot several times, he gave me the following feedback --

These are really great looking boots.  They offer excellent support/comfort around the ankles.  They are stiff but at the same time the leather is semi supple and giving, so walking in them feels great. I broke them in by strolling around NYC all day -- no blisters, chaffing or sore feet.  They have room in the toe box for my wide feet but not so much that they feel loose.  They sort of hug my foot but because the leather gives a bit, it's not an uncomfortable feeling at all.  Nice bonus -- they also add an inch or so to my height but hide it very well.

Thank goodness I finally found a boot he likes.  Hopefully FRYE lives up to its reputation for making long lasting boots!",5.0,0

"I am very short: 4'9"".  10 years ago, I could find pants and jeans that were short enough without more than the normal petite person's problem.  Then companies started to lengthen inseams.  I was never able to find pants in stores and only ordered online from places like lands end or llbean that are very clear about inseams and will sometimes hem for free.  When I tried on these jeans in the store on a lark and they actually fit with just a little extra length, I bought an extra pair off of amazon since I never know when this will happen again!  I have hips and thighs, and these jeans are not too tight BUT the waist is tight enough without gapping.  Amazing!  A jean that made by someone who understands that there is a shape and size in between beanpole and barrel!  I was so impressed I tried buying a different petite style in the same brand, but although the shape was nice in those, there is an extra 2 inches of length that will need to be hemmed.  Sooo, I'm not convinced this brand understands that petite people are short, but for this one product, I am happy!",5.0,0

"I do love it.  It's light weight, feels well built, rolls easily over cracks and great for getting the boys out of the house and into some fresh air.  I know it's silly to take two cats for a walk in a stroller but have you ever walked a feline on a leash?

I received this last week and the first 3 times they balked a bit as I made the walk only 20 minutes long.  Gradually they got used to being in a confined area.  I kept it open and in the living areas so they could play in it but their play got to be a bit rough and I see they have a pull in the netting.  That was my fault and certainly not of the manufacturer.

Now I bring it out of the closet and they both get in.  The walk is up to 1/2 hour and today they even laid down and I didn't hear a peep.

You should question how big your critter is before putting him into this stroller since it is a tad small.  My cats aren't yet a year old and probably not even 5 lbs. each.  There's no problem with them walking inside.  However, I hope they don't get too big to use through the years.

I recommend and do like the no zip.  The only thing I don't like is that I can't store the stroller folded and standing upright.  Perhaps I'll need to get a luggage strap to wrap around.",5.0,0

Height/Size is good and rope is wound and secured tight to post.  Base is solid and stands tall when cats scratch.  As my pictures show, my male cat has long legs and body and this post height fits him fine. Assembly is easy, only requiring a philips screwdriver.  My young niece and nephew had fun assembling it for the cats who started using it immediately.  The feather is a nice tease and so far still in tact after a few days of use. My cats seem to like the course texture.  From the pictures you'll see the cat playing with it in different rooms as we moved around looking for the right spot. Placing it where he stalks helps keeps him from scratching the carpets and furniture. My cats do well when we stimulate them with toys preventing boredom. The quarter circle shape fits nicely in corners or along walls.  We already had a post  with a square base and spring with pom-pom, which I don't like as much as this post.  I've never seen my cat go for the Pom-pom but the feather gets them going!  Having more in the house is not a problem, one upstairs, one downstairs.

"Pros- Great picture, slim design, light weight, 3d conversion is pretty cool.

No one is writing apps for them yet and the ones that are out are pretty lame/useless/not fun.  Even the YouTube app doesnt work with the keyboard side of the TV remote...fail.

Picture is still amazing and the small edges set this TV apart; best i've ever seen...it does have 240hz refresh rate (not CMR...what a joke).
The app store has not gotten much better.  I enjoy the CNET app, which is pretty much the only one I've downloaded after the fact that was worth anything.

Oh...3d glasses are HORRIBLE.  They do not last.  I have 1/4 that is still alive after a year.  The 2 i bought seperate from the TV (same model number as the ones that came with) didn't work all that great the moment i took them out of the box.
Even if they were working properly, don't expect to make it all the way through a long movie like Avatar without them dying on you.  that is awkward when you have to offer your pair to one of your guests and then they know you are sitting there watching a blurry picture.

"**UPDATED**
I adjusted the watch band by taking out one link and it was the most difficult watch I have ever adjusted.  I have watch tools and have adjusted, fixed and worked on a number of watches and other jewelry.  Getting the pin back in proved extremely difficult.  Once you pull it out the other piece of the band moves and it is very difficult to line it back up and get the pin inserted again.  typically this is a 5-10 minute job but with this watch it took hours.  After wearing the watch for 2 weeks, it literately fell off my wrist one day.  Lest you think I did not adjust it properly, it was the other side of the band not even close to the the adjustment I made.  I was not doing anything strenuous either, unless you consider typing on a laptop strenuous.  Because of this I have had to downgrade my rating for 4 to 2 stars.  Very disappointing!

If you are looking for a nice looking watch with little options at a good price this might be the watch for you.  This watch will not give you the date, does not have a faceplate light or glow, but it does keep good time and it looks very nice.  It is lighter weight than you might expect but seems to hold up fine with normal wear.  If you are concerned about a watch you can wear in the pool or need to see the date this isn't for you.  Overall this is good watch for the guy who wants to not spend a lot but have a good looking watch on his wrist.

"I am a full time dog trainer and I ordered this pouch in June. I wore this for 40 hours a week so I have to give some credit there, it held up pretty well for the amount of use. However, almost immediately the metal ring that stopped the cinch came out of the side of the bag and started to fray the material. I also did not have very good luck with the two sewn on straps next to the metal clip. They came out within the first month of me wearing the pouch. I had to use the cinch fairly often because dogs would find the pouch and stick their snoot in while I was talking to the owners, so I would cinch it closed. I finally ordered a new pouch in November (Doggone Good), so it took 6 months before I couldn't wear it any longer.

However, I did enjoy several features of the pouch which it seems my new pouch does not have. I could fit my iPhone 6 in the front zipper pocket easily so I could pull it out when I needed to make appointments or phone calls. As a woman, my pockets are very small so I am not sure where I am going to put my phone now. I also love the waste bag dispenser. I wholesaled ordered a bunch of waste bags so I was able to keep 3-5 rolls on me at a time, I never ran out. My new pouch only has room for two rolls. The metal clip on the back, even though I did not have the sewn straps, was very convenient and I could clip and unclip it from my belt very easily. I also liked that I could slip little things into the front mesh pocket, like prong collar links. So the bag isn't awful for the average dog owner, but won't withstand professional use.

I have included some pics so you can see how it looked the day I replaced it. The cinch area was in pretty rough shape at this point.",3.0,0

"Great theory, but poor construction.  It broke on day two after around 10 total minutes of use.  Two faults:  Poor gluing of the magnets under the alley and weak, unstable wood veneer used on the top surface of the lane......First the side magnet switch got stuck and would not come back up to the vertical position to set the pins up.  I took it apart underneath to find one magnet came out of it's circle and latched onto the neighboring magnet, blocking the triangle of magnets from rising fully to the top.  I reglued it and another one that was loose (only a string of glue kept it from popping out of its socket), and then added 2 drops of super glue to the sides of the others as well.  Problem #1 solved.  Then I noticed in a good light that the pin dots on the bowling lane were all raised slightly (about the size of a fingertip around each) and the king pin spot had a tiny crack in it.  The bumps obviously affect the roll, which is why the ball won't go where you aim.  The veneer must be very thin.  There should be a thin non-flexible substrate under this area, like a small aluminum or plastic sheet, to prevent the lower magnets from pushing the wood up.  OR, a ""stop"" installed in the plastic mechanism to prevent the magnet plate from rising any higher then the floor bottom, as without one the spring pressure bangs the magnets up slightly into the wood.  Still working on this problem.  Very disappointed.",1.0,0

The little over mit and pot holder are quilted and adorable.

The apron is put together so nicely with nice thick material and perfect hems.

"The Mega Fun 93628 Marble Fun Run has been a delight for my children to play with. This set has allowed them open ended play to build and discover for hours at a time. It's been fun watching them work and seeing them try to speed up or slow down their marbles to get to the bottom first. It's a good set to enhance problem solving skills, spatial reasoning, and so much more!

The set comes with 105 pieces and this includes 30 marbles. There are instructions to build the run on box, if so desired. The variety of pieces vary from curvy, straight, a loop de loop, starter areas with little levers, pieces that have detachable and re-attachable wheels, and more! Some of the pieces are translucent with sparkle and the rest are solid colors. The variety of colors this set is made up of makes it gender neutral. My son and daughter ages 7 and 4 years old have played with this set on their own as well as together.

This set is well made and the pieces stay together once hooked up together. I would suggest parents to put the little levers and tabs in the pieces they are meant for. My son tried to do this on his own and ended up breaking one of the pieces. With that being said, he tends to be a little rough on things. Other than that small mishap we've had no issues of the set showing wear or breaking easily.

I would certainly recommend this set. It's great for down-time during the afternoons or on days when the weather just too hot or rainy to enjoy outside. One thing I like is that more sets can be purchased to make an even bigger marble run!

"This doll house is extremely sturdy! All of the walls are nearly 1/4"" thick wood (or pseudo-wood composite) product. Some other reviews stated that the assembly instructions were very vague and difficult to read and that the product was difficult to assemble. I am happy to report that it's not! :) The assembly instructions were extremely simple, clear, and well-written (and I'm by no means a mechanic or carpenter - I normally have major issues figuring out how to get battery compartments open on toys - don't judge...some of those compartments are a real bear! (; ). All of the parts are well-labeled and easily identifiable so there's zero confusion. All of the parts lined up perfectly (a few other reviews said they didn't, so I'm thinking the ones that didn't weren't assembled correctly).
The furniture that came with the dollhouse is also very sturdy and well-crafted. The lamp (which lights up) has a timer on it which helps with battery life. The house itself stands nearly four feet tall - it's really big! Compared to the flimsy plastic and cardboard Barbie doll houses for close to the same price (been there, done that, lasted a month before it was destroyed by light play!), this dollhouse is a hundred times sturdier and just plain superior.

"Monopoly Electronic Banking certainly reflects the world we live in. I don't know the last time my kids actually saw me pay for anything with cash. In this version of Monopoly each player (up to 6 players) is provided an electronic debit card. With this debit card they purchase properties, pay rent, buy houses, etc.

At first I didn't know how I felt about this money-less version. It sure was easy to set up. No more sorting and counting fake $10, $20, $50, and $100 bills. However, I wasn't sure if my kids would understand that they didn't have an endless supply of money and that how they spent their money had an impact on the games outcome, since they didn't have the money visibly in front of them.

It didn't take them too long to catch on though. By the fourth time around the board they were asking about their balances and not just buying things without some thought.  Also, they easily caught on to how to raise their balance by adding properties, houses, and collecting rent.

The banker controls the electronic device that controls all the money. They have to insert a person's card, input the correct amount of $$$s and push the right button.  It isn't too complicated. If your child is comfortable using a simple calculator they should be able to manage this just fine.

Like the original Monopoly, this isn't a quick game. You can easily spend a couple hours playing. One nice thing that we found about the Electronic version, was the ability to easily take a break from the game. Everyone's balances remained stored on the banking device until we came back to the game and we didn't have to worry about all the loose bills getting scattered. If we want to start a new game, we just hit a single button on the banker's until it resets. Very easy.

I still like the original Monopoly, but this up-dated version is both fun and realistic.",4.0,0

"When the price lowered, I snatched this up. I just received it and am furious with FedEx because they left it out in the snow and when I went to lift it, the bottom fell open. Amazon did not pkg very well. FedEx just sucks...

Anyway, I am currently sitting amongst the parts of this thing trying to figure how the heck to put it together bc these are the worst instructions I've ever seen!! And I put together a much larger cat tree earlier this year.

For example, the instructions simply tell you you should have 8 lg sisal posts. What they don't decipher is that there are actually 6 of one size and two slightly smaller ones. And of the larger ones, several are weighted. It doesn't tell you which to use where. I'm going to assume the heavily weighted ones go on the bottom...

The pics in the instructions are also horrible. They are blurry and unclear. Still trying to figure out which is a base. I'm just going to look at a full color pic and wing it.

Update: I got it ""put together."" It's in quotes because I think the one piece is broken because it won't stay connected. And parts are missing from the catnip toy station. Very frustrating... There are two 'catnip stations' which are basically a hanging fuzzy ball surrounded by plastic tubes so it looks like a little cage. I am missing six of those tubes so I can't put the other catnip station on. Which means there is no stabilization there. And even the one I did add... as soon as the cats touch it, it will just pop off. Nothing really keeps it together!

And I think there need to be more longer screws. They expect you to use the shorter screws in parts where it doesn't work. I am sorry I bothered with this one. Mistake...",2.0,0

"I bought these scrubs for my wife and she loves them.  She also loves the way they look.  She had to get a size down but the fit was perfect.  The only thing I would say is that the size is way too small.  If you are short, you can get a size down.  If you are medium, you can get a size up.  I just wish there was a way to go by the size.  It's very easy to find scrubs in stores and I have no complaints.I love these boots! I have them in a size 8, and they fit great. They are soft and comfortable. I have to get them in a size 8 and they stay on my feet. They also have a nice stretch and arch support. I am 5'7 and the size 8 is perfect. I have a large in the lower back, so I wear a medium. I would recommend these.Love these!These are really nice quality jeans.  They are good quality, but not very soft.  I have a hard time finding jeans that have stretchy, very comfortable, and I find that these jeans tend to fall apart when I wear them all day long.  I'm not sure why, but I am pleased with the quality.  These jeans are very comfortable and are a great value for the money.  I'm still considering getting another pair.

"This medical kit is just okay. Naturally, my daughters favorite part is the stethoscope. Unfortunately Fisher Price decided to make the war pieces so large that they won't even kind of fit into an adult ear, much less a 3 year olds. Also, the stethoscope is very rigid and tough to play with. The bag that comes with it is somewhat of a joke. It's very difficult to fit everything inside (especially that rigid stethoscope), and it really doesn't stay closed so everything just falls out. She does enjoy the shot thing and the thermometer though. Overall I'd go with a different toy medical kit if I could.",3.0,0

If you cant have eyes on your baby every second (I have two older children I need to watch too) this float is not safe once your baby can stand.

This float would be great for younger children and I would have given it four stars if it hadn't been advertised for children through 2 years old.  I would say it is best for children 5 months to walking. The product description should also explain that the outer ring must be inflated. I thought it had a foam ring.",2.0,0

"I absolutely love this Black Dome Tungsten Ring.  I wanted to get my hubby a wedding band that is different and unique.  I fell in love with this one, it is solid black and polished.  This ring looks so good and is made very well.

I got a size 9 which fits my hubby perfectly.  I have a ring sizer at home and this ring was sized exactly.  The ring is heavy for a normal ring, but that is expected from a tungsten ring.  He says it fits and rests comfortable on his finger.

Tungsten is a very hard and dense metal.  From the research that I have found, tungsten is ten times harder than 18k gold and four times harder than titanium and twice as hard as steel.  This ring is very durable and will last the test of time.  It has a nice polish and since he has been wearing it, the polish has held up really nicely.  He does a lot of hard labor and nothing has scratched it.

I completely recommend this ring.  I did receive this at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.  This review is a 100% my own  opinion and I was not compensated in any way.",5.0,0
"This toy is amazing - and is in no way for kids only!  It was intended for my youngest nephew who does in fact adore it and carries it around with him, but his older brothers who are both teenagers also couldn't stop for lack of a better word ""playing"" with it.  In fact, he had to fight them off for playing rights!  When I first received it, I unboxed it to make sure everything was alright and you do need to put on the sticker decals according to the diagram on the box, and I've got to say that even for me as an adult seeing what it all does so I could explain it to him was actually quite fun for me too.

The Millennium Falcon itself is much larger than I imagined, making it even cooler for kids, and it's fantastic that they also included a Hans, Chewie, and R2D2 figure rather than making you buy all the people separately (though there is plenty of room for extra figures from the movie to buy on your own for even more fun).  There's so much you can do inside the Millennium Falcon too.  There are trap doors, a Jedi training station, a movable ladder, seats for your figures, blasting rockets, and a cockpit you can open and close.  For the adults and teens it was just a tad disappointing that the cockpit only sits one so Hans and Chewbacca can't both sit in there together like in the movies, but the youngest didn't seem to mind at all.

This really is so much fun for the young and young at heart.  If you were a huge Star Wars fan back in the day this is a must to get for your kids - and that way you can play with it too!",5.0,0
"I've heard these speakers at my local computer store. These are the best sounding among all the brands offered. Klipsch didn't sound as good and Creative Labs' isn't even an option. The control center is the best design so far. The display and power button emit a cool blue light that is nice to see at night. Every component looks very sturdy. There are three possible connections - Coax, Optical, mini. You can use all for three different sources. Just press a button from the control center to indicate what source you would like to use. How good are these speakers?  I own a couple. It may not compare to my JBL HT system which are THX-certified for true home theater use, but these cost thousands. With the price you're paying for the Logitech, it's a steal. I have Harman/Kardon Sound Sticks for my Mac and these suck especially for the price. I had Sony Dream System  DAV-C990 which I returned after two weeks because the speakers are not only dull, they seriously need some equalization. Now for the cons:
1. The speaker cords are too thin and short. 2. The cord from the control center to the bass module is way too short and the manual warns against extending it. I want my bass in the corner of the room, and the control beside my PC. 3. The remote needs aesthetic improvement. These speakers have good, powerful bass right out of the box. Bass lovers will adore these for their games and music. Just reduce the bass from the control center if it annoys you. Best of all - these are THX-certified. You can't beat the price and quality. Even Apple has adapted these speakers for their upcoming G5 desktops. And if someone knows good design, these people do.",4.0,0

"I use this mouse with an ASUS TF300T android tablet. I hate mouse pads, which is the only option my ASUS keyboard accessory has. I do alot of data entry and document creation with my tablet, and the lack of a good mouse slowed me down quite a bit.

Setting for it are accessible in the Setting menu under Language and Input. It operates smoothly, and is comfortable in the hand. It pairs immediately everytime I turn it on, and it has brought me back up to my accustomed speeds. The only complaint I have, and the reason it gets 4 stars instead of 5, is it's texture. It's contoured to be comfortable to the hand, and it is. But it's also slick all over. There's no rubberizered finish or textured band to give you hand purchase.

"I got a Kindle for Christmas and wanted to get a cute, but protective cover for it.  I did a lot of research, and M-Edge seemed to get really high reviews, so I bought one.

I got the fuchsia cover. It looks much different on my computer monitor than it does in person. On the monitor it looks more like a rose pink, but in reality it's a super bright, neon pink. I love pink, but I don't want it to stand out THAT much. It's really, really bright.

I knew this cover wasn't leather (unfortunately), but once I touched it I was disappointed in the feel of it.  Yes it is soft and smooth, but it looks and feels like plastic ""Pleather."" It really does have a bad over, but I was spoiled by leather in the past. No, it's not leather... but I knew that when I bought it, so I can't hold that against it.

Overall, I think the design of this cover is fabulous. I love how it incorporates the E-Luminator (sold separately). It's quite a slick design. I love that I can store the E-Luminator right in the case.  I also love the strap that keeps the book securely closed or open.  It folds back on itself like a dream, and is very comfortable to hold either open or folded back. The inside has a nice microfiber suede-like lining that offers protection against scratches.

This is skimpy set. When it is available and I can check it against the actual retail price I may update my rating. But otherwise meh. You only get round track, 3 cars, the controller and some removable decorations--it does have cool noises. I have a Marklin Z scale and an older O gauge by Lionel that I use during christmas time (obviously in different locations because near each other would be pure craziness) so I understand the train prices are more expensive than people realize, especially Engines. And this is a pretty neat and fun for little kids Engine. The Caboose is Bobber style and ok. The engine is a Lion chief Thomas the Tank and is very obviously the highlight of the set. The chirstmas hat makes it that much cuter. The remote is battery power and includes announcements and sounds but no smoke (that i could tell.) The middle freight car is nothing special and feels especially cheap, though to be fair these often do I think in part because of the open top design. The track diameter when fully spaced out is a little over 3 feet. The track is your standard Lionel rack and self stabilizes with the plastic base. With another car and 4-6 pieces of straight track this would be a neat 5 star set. As it is it just feels a little cheap. Lightweight, lots of plastic, not many cars and very small completed track.

I think most kids will love this set, and they can set it up themselves, and make train announcements--my nephew sure did--but I think parents need to understand what they're getting or they'll feel they maybe didn't get their money's worth. Its not quite the grand experience of trains of our youth. Its more plastic, less track, less cars, were bigger and we had to pay for it!",3.0,0

"I just moved to a new city and was constantly getting lost so I wanted to buy an easy-to-use GPS unit.  I've never owned a GPS before so I can't compare this product to others, but I was able to make good use of this unit within minutes of taking it out of the box.  The touch display and menu navigation are quite user friendly.  It took me a while to figure out the best settings, though. One thing to watch for is whether you are set for it to give the shortest route or the fastest route.  The shortest route will often take you on some pretty bizarre journeys, while fastest route will generally get you onto the major arteries and highways that you'll most likely want to use and remember.  Another thing it took me a while to realize is that you can change the default screen settings to tell you the direction of travel you are going in.

"I have always been fond of Roku and still use the first version they produced.

The setup is incredibly easy, though I don't understand how it would work without a computer.  The device upgrades itself fairly often, which is nice.  I can't believe how small this newest version is, but I like it.  I think it is similar in size to a full size computer mouse.

"I had a sony P-200 camera 7.2mp to replace it with the Canon. My friend bought a Canon G-7 to replace the Sony (We have the Same Sony Camera). We both got in to the hype of all the reviews. We both tested the canon cameras quite a bit. Both Canon(s) has more options then the Sony does. But the Sony overall picture is much sharper and the colors are more realistic and natural. I kept my Canon just cause I was in so deep, I had already received a 8 gig SDHC Card, had a rebate on the Epson Printer so I ended up keeping the Canon and sold the Sony. It was a hard choice, knowing the sony picture quality is that much better. My friend on the other hand is selling his New Canon G-7, ""too bulky and its not worth it to lug it around when the Sony P-200 takes better sharper pics."" I agree, the Sony picture quality is better then the Canon 850IS. I can affirm that! The only thing is the Sony takes average low light pics, but the Canon 850is is no world beater in that department either. When it comes to day light shots, the Sony wins hands down over the 850is and also according to my friend the sony beats the Canon G-7 in outdoor photos ""not zoomed"". Like I said the Canon(s) has more options, and some might counter that you need to manaual play with the canon to get a better pic. But really who wants to mess with manual settings on a trip overseas? How many pics will you miss? The Sony P-200 has as fast boot up as the Canon 850IS and takes pics much much faster with the flash when it comes to multiple pics. And the sony flat out takes better pics. No doubt the canon is a excellent camera, but its questionable as to how good compared with a sony that came out in 2005...the Sony has less options, but has great image quality and ""sony Style"".",3.0,0

"One cannot ask for a better product than this exercise pen.  Although I did not purchase this playpen for a puppy, it served its purpose exceptionally well for a mother cat and her five newborn kittens.  The purpose was to keep them isolated from my other cats while they were being cared for by momma and so that they could not wonder off and become lost prior to their eyes opening.

This playpen is built strong and durable, with two zippered opening on the side.  The netting on each opening can be rolled up and vecroed into place.  The entire top can be zippered off and on, providing easy access to reach your puppy or kittens/cats.  Two sturdy pouches on the side is available for grooming products and accessories.  There is also two net pockets.

One of the nicest attributes of this playpen is;  it can be folded and broken down quickly and stored in the storage pouch that comes with it.  Portable and easily moved by two people, even when erected.  Durable enough to be placed outside to allow your pets to get that fresh air environment.

The case was packaged inside fabric type sleeve and the clasp of the jewelry case was wrapped in tissue paper for protection. The case was put into another decorative box which in turn was tightly encased in the shipping box.  This was an excellent purchase as a very good price point.  It makes for a very nice gift.,5.0,0

"This skirt runs small. it is listed as a size large and by the sizing chart it is suppose to fit someone size 12-14. well im a small 14 and it is far from fitting me. it barely went over my hips and i was scared it was going to tear. I was hoping to wear this for a wedding this weekend but thats not going to happen. I would say the sizing is more of a size 10. There were no labels on this except one on the inside that had a 5 on it. nothing else. no care instructions or anything. I am on a weight loss journey so im going to keep it and make it my goal to get to. The inner material reminds me of slip material and it was clingy but that also might be because of the sizing..but it did seem to have quite a bit of static. The outer layer is a very thin see-through material. it is where the design in printed and it is very beautiful. the inner layer is about a foot shorter than the outer layer. The belt tie is my favorite part. It has beads and is made with real feathers. You can feel the stem in the fabric of the belt. over all if this skirt fit I would love it but until it does i just like it.

This was nice sized but unlike other kong toys is not durable at all.  My 50 lb wirehaired pointer destroyed it in 5 minutes.  The other kong stuffed animals have been awesome.  They still destroy them but it takes a while - like 3 weeks for that to happen.  I will stay with the real tough kong toys.

"I am searching online to find an easy way to make this shirt work for me. I ordered the size 6.5 and it fit perfectly. The fabric is soft and it is stretchy. The material is not see through so it will be fine if you don't have a lot of pockets. The bottom is a bit snug but I can wear it on my shoulder and I'm sure it will stretch.

"This wedding ring set arrived very quickly.  It really is a very nice set at a very reasonable cost.  It arrived in a very beautiful black velvet ring box.  I would not plan to wear this as an everyday ring set, since it is not a full white gold, just white gold plated, I would not expect it to hold up as well.  I like to wear different rings for different occasions, especially when traveling, so I don't have to worry about losing my actual ring set or having it stolen.

This set is very dainty looking and quite nice.  I ordered a size 7, which is what my original set is, and it fits perfectly. It's very comfortable to wear.  I take it off to wash my hands and I wouldn't sleep in it, so I have not seen any discoloration on the metal or on my hands.  For the price that this is offered at, I would definitely recommend it for someone to purchase as an extra set to wear on occasion.

"I have a 7 month old kitten, three 6 year olds and one 16 year old cat. My 6 year old Tortie figured this feeder out instantly. As soon as I put the food in one tube and moved to another tube, she was emptying the first tube. Zero challege for her but she seemed to enjoy the act of scooping the food. The other two 6 year olds figured it out after watching my Tortie. She was a better teacher than i was. However, one of them only has one eye. His depth perception is off. So for him i sprinkled kibble between the tubes for him to have to reach between and get. That still slows down his food intake but is a bit easier for him. The rest preffer the tubes. My 16 year old had to start out with no tube, but in a half hour was fine picking treats out of the smaller tube. My kitten eats kitten food as shes still growing so, shes not interested at all in the feeder as it has ""yucky big cat"" food.

"How cute (or sexy!) are these? What a fantastic idea, they took something that was needed by millions of women (chafing guard) and made it both practical and adorable. They come in a handful of colors here on Amazon as well as their website (where I ordered mine.) I got them in Black. For me, the size small was just right. MAKE SURE YOU MEASURE - don't make any assumptions on your size. How embarrassing would it be if this fell down because you got it too big.

This is very well made and has built in clear silicone rings - one at the top and one at the bottom. These are what keep it from sliding up or down. I tried really hard to a get a good photo to show the rings, but couldn't get the exact quality I was hoping for (because they're so clear.) I also took a photo of me wearing it down low on my thigh - I wasn't comfortable posting a photo in the proper place, and because it's lower than I wear it, I had to hold it in place with my hand. You get the point from the picture...

This works well to protect against chafing in dresses, skirts, short and pants. While it's not marketed as any kind of secret storage, it CAN (in my opinion) be used for this within reason. To do this, it's critical you get the right size... you COULD stick your ID, a CC and some cash inside the band (between the clear bands). It may even hold a cell phone, but I haven't tested it with anything that weight.

Overall, I really like these! Adorable (and sexy), and practical. I like mine and recommend them for others. I hope this review has helped others considering this purchase.",5.0,0

"My dog has had skin bacteria issue on and off for a while because of his age and immunity.  I read the reviews on this item and had tried the Zymox brand for his ear yeast infections and this stuff performed pretty miraculously.

The shampoo is amazingly rich and thick.  It smells good and does a much better job than following up my dog's bath with a vinegar rinse which is what I was doing before to get rid of the skin issues.  However, my sensitive dog hated, really hated the vinegar rinse and it would stress him out so much that I had to find another solution.  I tried this and he was pleasantly surprised as was I.  This gets to the deep areas beneath the coat easily and doesn't just sit on the surface of the skin.  I followed the instructions about letting it sit for 3-5 minutes and I let it set for five and more.  The shampoo is easy to rinse out and really leaves his skin feeling soft.  After his bath, he does not show the normal irritation of moving from one position in the house to the next.  He seems more settled and not trying to escape the itch.  After his bath, I inspected the areas and they were almost as pink as the rest of his normal skin.

But don't be fooled!  Bacteria and fungus invasions are nothing to play around with.  I am giving him a bath every other day for three weeks and washing his bedding every single day and it is making a difference.

"3 months ago the case looked very luxury and looked like a case that would hold up. It hasn't completely fallen apart but there are two problems with it so far.

1. the magnets do not stay in their spot, as if the glue used isn't strong enough. Because of that the magnet moves and sets in between the leatherette.

2. the leatherette is separated because of the magnets. Also on other corners it is separating as well.

Overall I like the case and hope it doesnt fall apart completely anytime soon.

Update (June 15, 2013):

The Magnet at the top has officially feel out of the case. This iPad is used for mixed business and pleasure so it is not really used all the time. I'm the only one that uses it. But from constant opening of the case, it pulls the magnets up, therefore tearing the leatherette more and more. The bottom magnet doesnt stay in the original hole anymore and is pushing its way through the leatherette and plastic. The top you can easily peel back and put the magnet back in place but it comes right back out anyways. Its very frustrating being that the rest of the case is holding up well.",3.0,0

"I am impressed with each and every 'Reproduction Barbie Doll' that I own. I bought one for each of my four granddaughters, with the hopes of keeping this iconic legend alive. Barbie is educational because she encourages socialization and etiquette through role play. Of course, you need more than just the doll. I also bought the basic accessories and a few extras. A school classroom set will add to the fun. Also, a dining room, table and chair set with miniature dishes will teach the girls how to set a proper table and reinforce manners. However, the real role playing can only be taught by a good role model. That includes explaining that Barbie's body measurements are not realistic. This could lead to a discussion about being comfortable with our curves or lack thereof. Maybe even a discussion of anorexia versus obesity. That is why I highly encourage mothers (and grandmothers) to spend some time playing with their daughters. The magic moment is when you watch your girls playing alone or with friends and see how they reflect your positive influence. That, in turn, is carried throughout a lifetime.

"There were three questions I had in mind when I received these gloves in the mail:
1) How well do they work on touch screens (""capacitive material"")?
2) Will they keep my hands warm (""Cold Weather Gear"")?
3) Will they last?

1) When I first opened these gloves, my first take was that they were merely knit gloves with different thread color on the finger tips.  But after putting them on and looking closer, the three finger tips (first two fingers + thumb) are indeed made of a different material that provided a high degree of responsiveness on our iPad.  Score one for the gloves!  Alas, I had less luck with my iPhone, where my thumb is needed for typing.  There is a seam that runs across the top of the thumb exactly where my fingers come into contact with iPhone, rendering the ""Capacitive Material"" useless.  WIth a slight roll of my thumb, or shifting of the seam, I could get them to work properly.  But definitely a design flaw.

2) I ran an errand first thing the next morning - about 25 degrees outside.  Based on the knit material, I was less than surprised to discover these gloves lack sufficient warming properties to qualify is ""Cold Weather Gear.""  I would not recommend these much below 45 or 50 degrees.

3) The material is highly porous with skin visible through the material.  There were loose threads as well, straight out of the package.

"One thing I find a bit inconvenient about this food is that I have to have a spoon or fork to get it out of the can with.  That's a trade off, because that means it's not all gravy and the cats get more real food for the catfood buck.  I also have to always chop it up because if I don't, my cats just look at it like ""What is this strange thing, mama?  You expect me to do what- exactly- with this?""

After chopping it up, the cats like it just fine.  I wouldn't say they love it.  They don't dance around when I open the can.  It's almost like they can't really tell what it is right off.  Once they realize it is food, they eat it all readily.

It has agreed well with my oldest, sickly cat.  She has breast cancer and a very sensitive tummy.  She hasn't thrown up eating it and she's been acting like she feels very good.  She's been totally curious about everything I do and very active.

I did feed it to several of the crew though, as a topper, and my youngest kitty - 8 months old- threw up all night the 2nd time he ate it.  The first time, he was fine.  The others were all fine so this might have just been a coincidence.",4.0,0

"Thunderbolt transfers are ridiculously fast compared to Firewire and USB -- 10 gbps -- and are incredibly handy when working on the fly with large files. It's an excellent choice for large video, photo, and audio files. It can be daisychained, too, so you can have multiple adapters setup for one machine (ultimate efficiency and speed!).

Unfortunately, no cable is included - so this can become an expensive upgrade pretty quickly.  I used this in conjunction with a 3TB Seagate drive, and was very pleased at its utility for backing up and storing files; Thunderbolt's speed is definitely overkill for regular small backups, but is invaluable with huge files and directories. It doesn't require a Seagate hard drive, just any SATA III drive.",4.0,0

The ""stickers"" on it are decent quality, have some jagged edges tho. My twist came in the multicolor option, and i do know that some buyers have gotten a blue/white pattern on theirs. Its random which you receive.

"This version of Risk has you fighting for control of middle earth.  There are four sets of armies to chose from gold and green are the Alliance of Elves and Men while red and black are the armies of Mordor.  The this version of risk adds in generals, strongholds and the fellowship of the ring movie along to Mount Doom; all of these can be optional of course.  Generals and strongholds add one to the players highest roll, so if you are defender being attacked and you territory has a stronghold in it then your 6 becomes a 7.  If you are an attacker and have a general in the territory you are attacking from then your 6 becomes a 7.  Now the playing with the fellowship of the ring then they begin in Shire and move you terroritory per turn till they reach Mount Doom.  If the fellowship lands in a terroritory controled by the forces of Mordor then they can roll to capture the fellowship and thus win the game, but if the fellowship reaches Mount Doom then the forces of Mordor loose.  Beyond these additions this game play like normal Risk.  Overall this a fun version of Risk and if you love both Risk and LOTR then this is a must buy.",5.0,0
"I'm an owner of a recording facility and I've been creating music and commercials for the public, for 26 years now. Most people never see the cables that we use, so let me give you the idea.

For instance I have about a dozen 8 channel snakes with the  inch ends that are interconnects to and from the console to rack mount effects and processors and or the in and outs of 16 channel sound cards. The cables used within these snakes are as small as can be used for convenience. They have molded plastic ends with strain relief and they are bundled into a flexible tube with about 18 inches of free cables at both ends.

There's another version that's a 16 + 2 channel snake into a room for live drums that allows for low Z microphones to be plugged into it, there's 18 tiny, thin cables within this snake. That one is 50 feet long.

When people are impressed by large diameter cables, I know that they haven't been educated in what's needed, that they've been educated by advertising.

This is a great cable that has what's needed. I tested it's shielding by listening with cranked up headphones and running it over sources of EMF and heard nothing. It's soft and flexible making it tangle resistant and it has strain relief. The fact that it's thin is convenient, it does not reduce the performance one bit.

So the picture may show what appears to be another cheap cable, but this one is a couple grades better than those. It will feel different, it's smaller and easier to work with and I'll bet that it's interference rejection ratio is higher too.

Really, if you want 5 feet of Tip-Ring-Sleeve stereo, line level cable for any use, this cable is very close to perfect and I recommend it. I'm using it in my recording facility when needed without issue.

Thanks for sending me this nice cable to test and review.",5.0,0

"I can't say enough about this dress!  It is very simple but perfect in all the ways. I am 5'3 and 140 with a 40D bust and normally wear a L but went with the XL because I saw mixed reviews on how it fit. A L would have fit  fine but the XL works too as this is meant to be loose and drape. This fits perfect in the bust with a nice V neckline. The straps are adjustable and the comes up to the armpits so you don't have to worry about you bra showing and if you have a little extra chunk where your chest and armpit meet, this covers it nicely. this is very flowy and has a beautiful irregular hemline. The drape effect comes from extra material on the sides so if you spread it out it looks like batwings. The material is soft and stretchy, but you won't need any extra stretch. It is tapered just right to show off your curves and flatters any shape.  The shortest parts comes just above my knees and longest just below. I would recommend a lint roller.

"I really like this product.  My 9lb pomeranians fit compactly within.  It looks a bit snug for them to sit up but it's workable.  The product is very versatile and we've already used them a few times.

Now that we've had this for a while, I'd like to add a few things.  We bought two.  We use these as car seats.  The first trip, I put them up high so the dogs could look out the windows.  It didn't go well.  The dogs wanted to jump out and play around so it was a bit of a mess.  Now, I set them on the seat.  I put a towel on the bottom to keep the dogs cozy.  I clip their harnesses to the inner leash and adjust it so they are free to move around but unable to jump out of the seat.  These adjustments have made for much more pleasant traveling.  They ride with the mesh door down and sometimes with it zipped shut and both are well tolerated.

When taking them out to the car, I roll one and I back pack one.  I find that both options work well.  I wouldn't want to roll one long, treacherous distances or do too much backpacking but it works for getting them in and out.  As previously mentioned, I sit the traveler directly on the seat and seat belt them in but when I hung it up higher using the headrest, it worked well and seemed stable.

The pockets allow for leashes.  That's about it.  It's not big enough to store toys or food or whatever.

"The Gentle Leader Headcollar is AMAZING!!! I have a 3 1/2 year old newly adopted rescue puggle who take way more after his beagle mother and has beyond an impeccable nose and sensing abilities. So our usual walks on a regular 6ft leash were more of him running towards all the different scent trails he smelled and me dragging behind trying to keep up while in the process of not being able to be as fast as him, he would pull on the leash, therefore choking/causing restriction to himself. I was not happy about this - not only was he uncomfortable, but so was I. This morning I was delivered the Gentle Leader headcollar and went home for lunch to test it out ..... WOW!!! Even after reading all the great reviews here, I seriously did not expect it to work on the first try, but was so very pleasantly surprised. No difficulty putting on, my puggle, Chewy, seemed comfortable with it on (although on occasion he did paw at it since he is not used to wearing something around his muzzle area) but did not show any sign of discomfort. With the first few steps he was beginning to walk by my side or a tiny bit behind me and followed my lead versus just running off after any/all random scent trails! I still allow him to follow all the scent trails he sniffs, but we do it at an acceptable rate versus having the 'zoomies' towards all the scents. This is just our first walk in the first day too!!

The Centon SD card eliminates the need to connect either camera directly to my computer in order to download the photos/videos. My iMac has an SD slot but I use a USB SD card reader for my MacBook Pro while traveling. And it is fast, and that means I can take more photos faster... and I also don't have to wait for my video camera in-between shots. In addition to cameras, this Centon SD card is also compatible with some models of Android smartphones.

Two thumbs up for the Centon SD card!",5.0,0

These pants stay in place and keep their shape really well, so I don't have to keep pulling them up and they don't stretch out while I'm wearing them, so no butt sag.  And they really do a great job of keeping my tummy looking flat, but without pinching.  These really are the perfect pants!  I'm currently a size 6 and I could have gone down to a 4 in these, so keep that in mind.

"My 25 year old tripod broke, so I purchased this.  Actually, I liked it so much I purchased two of them and gave one to my father.  This is much nicer than my previous tripod.  The tripod has a very ""finished"" look to it and appears to be a very quality product.  The design of it makes it very flexible allowing you to position your camera just about any way you can immagine.  It comes with a nice carry bag, its fairly light weight - without that cheap feeling to it, and it is very compact when fully collapsed.

I have not experienced any problems while using the tripod.  It is stable and there is no creep in the head when the camera is mount in any position.

I believe for many photographers this tripod would be more than suited for them.  While it looks like a well made tool, I'm not sure it would take much in the way of any abuse.  If you need something rugged, this may not be what you are looking for.

He has a wide foot and this boot is perfect for that. I'm 5'4"", 130lbs and these boots are a little narrow for him. He's tall and they're a little tight on him, but he's not afraid to wear them.

"This is my second pair of Brainwavz Angled Memory Foam earpads. The first set I purchased was for a a pair of Audio Technica M50's that I enjoyed, but always found the earpads a bit uncomfortable. The Brainwavz fit perfectly and installed in less than 2 minutes.

The second pair are for a set of HiFiMan HE-400 headphones. It's here that I'm deducting a star. While it is nominally true that it will fit the HiFiMan series of heaphones, the Brainwavz are not an exact fit. First off, the earpads are oval shaped while the HiFiMan uses round circular earpads. Second, the HiFiMan headphone earpads use an inner lock ring on the earpad. This requires you to remove the lock ring and insert it into the Brainwavz earpad. The ring is circular, which requires a great deal of stretching of the Brainwavz earpad. I did pre-stretch it before attempting to insert the lock ring but it is a struggle fitting a circular plastic ring into an oval earpad. I cracked one ring on the first attempt (thank God for duck tape) that I repaired and finally got it in. Having learned from the first, I was able to get the second ring in a bit easier.

As you can see by the photo, they look pretty good once installed. They are a 1000% improvement in comfort from the stock HiFIMan earpads, which are very shallow and cause your ear to rest upon the inner grill cover. The Brainwavz are like to cushy pillows on your ears and more importantly add some distance so your ears are not resting directly on the grill.

From a sound perspective, my HE-400's are a bit airier with the velour pads, but in truth I have not experienced any major sound changes using the new pads.

The Brainwavz are a worthy upgrades for HiFiMan headphone owners. Just be aware of that you have to fit those rings before you can mount the earpads.",4.0,0

"Bought this because I thought it was time to upgrade my old Harmony One. The physical Harmony Home remote is fantastic. I love the simple design, love the fact that you can program buttons to do two different things depending on if you long press or short press. Love that it's RF. If Logitech threw an LCD and backlight on this thing, it would be the best remote they've ever created.

Where the problems begin is there's no LCD on the remote. Your smartphone is supposed to take on that task and unfortunately, the app that makes this possible just sucks. Sometimes it's slow to connect to the hub, sometimes it crashes, sometimes the hub just stops responding to it. More often than not, I would grab the OEM remotes because it was so much faster and less frustrating. That's not a good sign.

I actually managed to put up with the app for a while, but the thing that had me running back to my Harmony One was when something gets out of sync (happens more than you think), there's no ""help"" button on the remote. I had to dig my phone out, unlock it, launch the app, wait for it to find the hub, hope the app doesn't crash, then fix the sync problem. This would take me 2 seconds to fix with my old Harmony One. With Harmony Home, it takes a good minute.

I don't like the direction Logitech is going with the smartphone thing. They need to focus on making good physical remotes. Does anyone really enjoy using their smartphone as remote? It's clumsy and takes too long to do anything with. I cringed every time I needed to launch the Harmony app to do something. I need tactile buttons Logitech!",2.0,0

"I own 4 Mini Schnauzers.  This doggy door has been a dream.  We installed it on the ground level of our basement door.  I am no longer a door man for my dogs.  Yah!

This ends up to be quite an energy saver since only a little air gets in the house.  Compare that to the amount of air that comes in the house when you have to open a door for a dog to go outside.

Here is the drawback.  My dogs love to grab shoes and anything else they can find and drag it out to the back yard.  I have to go out regularly to pick up the things they drag out there.  I also have to close the door occasionally since they can start to dig holes in the yard if given too much outdoor freedom.  I also close the door occasionally so the dogs won't bark at neighbors.

"I was looking for a sturdy waterproof camera for my daughter. I wanted a good quality camera that could stand up to the mishaps of an eleven year old. She is in love with this camera because of all of the neat features that it has. She is able to take selfies with the frontal view of the camera allowing her to see herself. It is shock proof and so far it stands up to that fact as she has dropped it several times, knowing at times she can be clumsy this camera has given me the tranquility to know that this camera will outstand some of the abuse.

The down side that I have found with this camera is that it uses batteries and no charger. We fixed the problem by buying recharger batteries, which is great because she uses the camera quite a lot. Using a 2gb seems to go pretty fast, so I definitely recommending to get a bigger mini memory card. This will help from needing to remove or transfer pictures to another device. The batteries seems to hold for the usage, so don't be scared that it won't last long. Definitely recommend the product!",5.0,0

"I was a big fan of the Dinobots as a young child growing up in the 80s. My favorites were Grimlock and Snarl, but Slag was the first one I owned and he still has a special place in my heart because of this. Well, the Bey-verse Slug is NOT my Slag. This Transformer is much smaller and is brightly decked out in purple and red colours instead of silver, gold and gray. As much as some older TF fans like myself may want to compare AoE Slug to classic Slag, it really is apples and oranges. That said, if you WANT a Dinobot closer to your childhood memories, do a google search for FanToys Scoria. This third party Slag looks like the original but has the articulation and poseability of a modern Transformer. It'll also set you back two hundred bucks, so this $9.99 Slug may sound better and better after that revelation

Slug (SLAG!) is a pretty easy transformer to well, transform. His modes are pretty easy and obvious to shift from one to the other. The Dinosaur (triceratops) looks fine if a bit garish. My wife likes how colourful he is and once you get past the G1 Dinobot paint scheme that is more than likely embedded into your head, you'll be okay with it. Paradigm shift people!

Robot mode is where Slag falls apart. Part of it is indeed my own preconceived notions. it's weird having the triceratops head as shoulder pads instead of a helmet for example. Other parts are just bad design. Slug's robot head is just kind of a blob amdhis front dino legs are just hanging out on his side in robot mode, making Slug look more like Shiva than a Dinobot.

So all in all, the price point is nice and when you get past the G1 expectations in your head, the dino mode of Slug is pretty decent for a Bey-verse figure but the robot mode is really lacking. We'll call it a thumbs in the middle here.",3.0,0

"The earbuds are of very good quality, producing very good sound even at high levels. They are comfortable in use. Sound isolation is only moderate, but there is some useful effect. Be aware that there is no volume control on the earbuds themselves. For most uses they are amazing value for money. For the use I bought them for (in the line-out jack from a TOM TOM GPS on a motorcycle) they weren't the best choice. But I removed the soft silicon ends, drilled a hole in the end of the foam earplugs I always wear on the bike, and zip tied the earplugs on to replace the original ends. This is now exactly what I needed - the ear plug attenuates the (very LOUD) volume from the line-out jack, and also provide the sound isolation I needed.

"Sample provided at discount or no cost for evaluation.

I don't know why, but my family has a lot of fun with masks and costumes, well past their typical use day and age suggestions. So I knew that we'd have fun with this one. I chose the pug because........... um, it's a pug?!? A pug face on a dog body is cute/funny enough. A pug face on a human body is hysterical.

This mask is rubber and fits a variety of head shapes and hair styles. It does have a funky smell as a lot of rubber masks do, but once it's aired out a bit, it's not even noticeable. The eye holes are actually near the snout, rather than the actual eyes, so it gives it a little more of a realistic look. The only thing I'd change is the mouth opening. If the person wearing it smiles and their teeth show it's super freaky. We're using this as a quick costume when needed, to make funny videos, to wear while riding the bike (why not - it really makes people look twice). Sometimes I wear it in the car (as a passenger, never while driving). Basically, doing anything you can think of that would look funnier if a person with a pug head was doing it.

It's a fun mask, good quality and would definitely fit a variety of sizes. See my photos for an idea of how it fits an adult woman and adult man. I'd actually like to get some of the other critters for variety.",4.0,0

"This was a pain to assemble (you need strong thumbs to force the clips onto the wires), but so very worth it!  A friend bought me this as a gift, and the shelves are so much bigger than the other pen I have that full-sized cat beds fit easily on them.  In fact, it's assembled in my living room and operating as the ultimate cat tree.  I have a cat bed on each shelf and 2 in the bottom, and the cats spend a good chunk of time in there voluntarily.  I'm thinking of attaching a couple of dangling cat toys to the top so that they can play in there as well, but it's turned out to be their favorite napping place other than next to the human on the lounge.  I have 7 cats and would seriously consider getting a 2nd one, so that they can all nap in one when I'm not here to curl up next to.  Also considering putting litterboxes in the bottom of one... may just encourage use.

Clips were changed between original instructions and shipping, there were updated instructions in the bag with the clips, they weren't hard to understand, but took some serious torque with my thumbs to get them clicked into place.  And, while they work fine on the sides, for attaching the top they seem a bit iffy.  I am using nylon slip ties to help tighten that up since I have cats who like to scale the outside of it and sit on top -- I may even put a pet bed up there and tie it in place for my 2 serious climbers.

"It's ironic as I bought this ""cheap"" harness because my puppy managed to chew his way through four very expensive harnesses in two weeks. In frustration I purchased this harness and viola - no more Houdini. There is a grommet on the back of the harness that you can tighten to hold the harness securely in place. No matter what size your dog is, the harness will most likely will fit snugly at all parts of the body (neck, legs, chest) which is exactly what you want. I also like the furry underarm straps so it doesn't rub the fur off his armpits when we're walking. And it's nice that there aren't any ""snapping"" parts to accidentally get his fur or skin caught in. You just slide it over his snout and then put his front arms through the straps. In fact, it's the fastest harness to put on when we have to take him out for a quick tinkle (we don't trust him on just a collar with his strong prey drive). The only downside with this harness is that since our dog is a very strong puller, he still pulls against you when walking. He doesn't choke himself though which is nice. I would recommend that a front clipping harness is better for walking when your dog is a strong puller, but this harness is great if you are tethering him, putting him in a dog seat belt in the car, or taking him out for a quick break (and it's the best fitting harness we've ever found for our growing boy).",5.0,0

"It does what it says - it provides a stable mount for up to two 2.5"" drives in a regular internal hard drive slot. Here are the problems:

It's not compatible with the newer ""toolless"" cases that use posts rather than screws to secure the hard drive. The posts will not fit through the holes. Luckily, thermaltake does provide all the screws you need - just pop the posts out of your hard drive tray or mounting bracket and replace with the larger of the two sizes of screw they provide.

It is also difficult to access the screw hols for the lower of the two drives in this mount. If you need to mount two drives, do the lower one first, and find a small screwdriver.

Finally, the connectors for the hard drive will be recessed about one inch into the bay compared to the rest of the drives. If you have a small or a very populated drive bay, it will be difficult to access those connectors, and if you have the angled SATA connectors, you will not be able to connect two drives in this bay, at least one drive will need a straight SATA connector.

"It's as simply as it gets, and an excellent choice in a portable lapdesk.

Appealing in every way.  The thin (about 0.5"") and light design (my postal scale weighs it in at 1lb 13oz) makes it a perfect companion to your notebook carrier or bag.

I have bought several options for bed use in the past, but always found them to be cumbersome or difficult to move etc.  And god forbid you had to get up quickly.  With this desk, you simply move your computer instead of having to move one then the other.  Then there is car use.  No more lugging something to avoid burning your legs.  A simple take-along and it slides right under the seat.  I have not used it for travel or airplane, but I see this as a great option if needed.  My PC is getting ""older"" and I feel it gets hotter than it should at times, but this is a great remedy.  The hollow core keeps it cooler and safer.  When not in use, I store it easily on my bookshelf, and it takes no room.",5.0,0
I ordered an XL. My waist is 31 butt and hips 46 i'm 5'7. It was hell getting on. I have a very large bottom so it was difficult getting over the humps but it smoothed everything out and it did not make my butt go flat like some reviews said. My waist line improved but it pronounced my luv handles. If I had a shorter torso I think the cincher part of the waist wouldn't push out the luv handles. I you want to use the pee hole make sure its lined up right and if you do you have to wear underwear over the suit.,3.0,0

I love this blue version of the Petit BearGguy! I loved the mini one like this that came with the white BearGguy kit and when I saw them being sold separately in different colors I had to get them all. They are the same mold but each one comes with a jigsaw puzzle shaped base that connects with the others so you can form a combined base in a variety of configurations. Each one also comes with the attachment piece so any of the bigger BearGguy models can alternately hold hands (paws) with it if you want. Since they're all the same mold you can also swap pieces and make custom multicolor as well. Whether you use them as add-ons for other models or just want to display them alone they are really cute and very simple to build. You do not need to know Japanese to understand the instructions and these mini models would also make great starter kits for newbies just getting interested in gunpla.,5.0,0

"For the most part this thing works by catching food and water from spilling out from the bowls. There are a few annoyances with this feeder, however:

- The top light part and the bottom dark part are two separate pieces with no clips or latches. it simply sit's on top loosely and my 8 week old puppy has pushed it out from the bottom part a few times.

- There are no easy way to pick this tray up. If you grab the top part you'll simply lift it away from the bottom part. You'll have to use to hands or hold at an awkward angle to pick up both trays.

- The rubber feets are loose and not securely attached to the tray. One fell out at some point and now the tray wobbles when the puppy tries to eat.

- The last thing is the bowls are very light or it has no method to secure the bowls from moving around when the dog tries to eat or simply being lifted completely out of the hole.

These things hard to see from the listing and only discovered after using for a week. It still works fine besides those annoyances. Some pros are my puppy likes to bite the walls like a chew toy.",3.0,0

"I bought my first set of these headphones about a year ago.  I was able to look past the annoyingly long right ear wire because they do have excellent sound quality.  I used them mainly at the gym and noticed that after being on the treadmill for a few minutes that the combination of sweat and the weight of the cord would pull the left earpiece out.  I tried all 3 rubber sizes but was constantly pushing that left piece back in.  Also, when lifting weights I run the cord under my shirt and found that the thick rubber piece where the right and left earphones split would catch my shirt and again pull the left earpiece out, even more often than while running.  This was annoying, but I would still have rated these 4 stars because walking my dog or listening in bed these were the best phones I ever heard.

 - Very thin, and didn't add much bulkiness to the device
 - Nice thick cover with soft inside, made me feel that the screen would be protected.
 - The faux-leather cover dosen't look too ""fake""

What I didn't like:
 - The band that is made to hold the device closed. I stopped using it after the first day. Don't they know that this will just break off? Plus, the cover stays closed well on it's own.

The little black clips slide around and make it hard for gameplay, as most of us don't remember how many points we have on the cards. One member of our group used some pieces of note card to pad under the clips, it helped if you don't feel like replacing the parts.
It's a good game to play with 6 people, although it does take seemingly forever to get to your turn again (i was always the last player to go, so it didn't help).
I wish i wasn't a visual learner sometimes, because when people read off their cards it's a bit hard to follow, but i just asked for the card to be passed around the group if there was nothing ""secret"" on it.

"Netrunner is a great, great game. Lots of strategic depth, endless replayability, and plenty of expansion content to help keep your decks fresh. However, it's important to note that Netrunner is a CARD game (Living Card Game to be specific), not a boardgame (the contents of this box are basically some decks and some tokens), and is incredibly complex in its play pattern -- much more so than Magic. If you're considering this game for a fun game night with friends, it's not going to be a great choice. It takes a few hours to learn the basic rules, then a few play-throughs to understand the mechanics, and then hundreds of hours to fully grasp the potential of deckbuilding within the universe.

However, if you have one hardcore friend who loves strategy games and deckbuilding, putting in the time to learn Netrunner together will probably be worth it. Just understand that Netrunner is a lot more like Magic than like Pandemic or other highly-reviewed board games, and determine whether that's your cup of tea before proceeding.",5.0,0

"I like and admire cats, but I'm a dog person. And I've never been fond of cleaning up after indoor cats. We had a couple of cats through the years when kids were little, and of course, I did the clean-up. So secretly, I was not thrilled when I agreed to take my daughter's sweet rescued cat to live with me because she had so little room in her NYC apartment. I knew what was in the future. Lots of mess.  I don't mind the scooping.  To me, the biggest annoyance about cat litter is the gritty cat litter scattered on the floor.  There is nothing worse then walking bare-foot into invisible cat litter spread on the floor.

We needed a new cat litter box here so after reading more than I wanted to know about the various options, I picked this one instead of the hooded kind, and I am SO glad I did.

I chose the open design because it is so much easier to just scoop and clean it more often.  There is no odor when you clean it daily and it only takes a minute with this design. A closed litter box is too easy to ignore.

This thing is well-engineered:

Most of the litter stays in the box.
It's effortless to reach down into it to scoop and clean.
Very easy to clean.
Anti-microbial without any chemical odors.
Holds a boatload of litter.
Tucks into a corner.

Since buying it, the litter mess hasn't vanished but it's 90% better. And I am getting attached to the new feline member of the household too.  I recommend this product whole-heartedly!",5.0,0
"These Polk headphones are awesome.  They adjust easily to fit, and the full-sized ear pads damp out most external noise, making listening an even more enjoyable experience.

The sound quality is absolutely top-notch.  I'd been listening to my music mainly with earbuds lately, but when I plugged these headphones in I started to hear subtleties and nuances in the music that I'd been missing.  They also work fantastic for watching movies on a computer, digital pad, or smartphone.

This headphones' full sized ear pads are soft and extremely comfortable.

No complaints at all.

Highly recommended!

"This is the first camera case I have ever bought so I don't have anything to compare it to.  As another reviewer mentioned, it is small inside unless you take out the divider. This case is meant for all S series cameras and I have an S700.  With the divider out there is plenty of room for the camera.

The top pocket inside the main case is mesh with a zipper closure, and the pocket on the front has room for two memory cards and an additional mesh pocket (no zipper, but the front pocket zips closed). The back of the case has a belt loop - though who could wear something this big on their hip?

I like that the case is not huge and bulky - fine for my needs, and it has a strong, detachable strap to carry over my shoulder.

Overall a good, well-made case that will last for a long time.",4.0,0

"I bought this for my 3-year-old daughter just a month before her 4th birthday. She loves jigsaw puzzles and things like Imaginets, but this was her first game of this sort. It took her a few cards to get a feel for the idea and become more familiar with the objects, but after that she really took off with this game. She completed all of the cards in two sessions, but she continues to ask for it. I think I could have bought a more complicated set from this company (and I plan on it!), but this one has been a great starting point for my daughter. It really is a high quality game with wooden pieces that are a great size for preschoolers to handle. The cards progress in difficulty, and it's quite impressive how many challenges there are using only four pieces. Very clever and perfect for quiet play!",5.0,0

"Absorbs odor very well. Switched to it from tidy cats and my cat loves it. One time, I had to switch back to tidy cats for the week (due to poor planning on my part- had to get whatever the gas station had) and my cat very unhappy! She let me know she didn't want to use her box unless it had the precious cat litter in it by leaving me a little ""present"" next to the box when it was the tidy cats litter. So now I stock this stuff religiously and we have no problems. I think she likes that it's unscented and I like that it works so well. I used to buy these 40lb bags via PrimeNow(cat litter to your door in less than 2 hours? Yes please!) but the drivers in my area must have complained about the weight because now they only carry the smaller bag. I wish it was on Prime Subscribe and Save.

My one pet peeve about this product: it's dense meaning from a volume perspective you actually get less. I store the bag in an old (cleaned out) tidy cats pail and that's how I know that one 40lb bag of Precious cat takes up barely slightly more volume as one 24lb pail of Tidy Cats. I'd say 30lbs Precious Cat probably equals 24lbs Tidy Cats. I don't think it's a big deal. The added density is probably why it's less dusty and clumps better than other litter brands. But if you're like me and fill the litter box to a certain volume all the time, it's just something to think about when deciding how much/often to order.",5.0,0

"We have a large, 15lb cat and he is quite long and leggy. We feared this would not be large enough for him, but that is not the case. He is able to comfortably sleep on this window bed and it has stayed in place without fail. I was hesitant, but the suction cups work very well so there is no fear of it falling. However, our cat tends to get hyper and loves to run and jump. Upon jumping on this bed from about a foot above, the suction cups gave way and scared our cat enough to keep him away from it for a few days. He has since recovered and now sleeps on his window bed most mornings to warm himself in the sun. He didn't care for the texture of the actual bed so I threw a blanket over it and that did the trick.",5.0,0

"Similar issue to another recent reviewer.  The screen I received did not have LP133WF2 anywhere on it, except for a printed sticker on the cardboard packing.

"I'm a science teacher, and when I saw this, I thought it would be perfect for my nephews. It's a really cute set and has lots of neat patterns to view under the ""microscope."" There are 3 lenses....one is a mangnifier, one is a color lens, and the third is ""textured"" to alter the pattern of what you see under the microscope. Each pattern disk has various patterns on each side, so there is lots to look at. The only thing I'm not fond of is the magnification ""lens."" It's really cheap and doesn't really magnify anything...just makes everything blurry. I know this isn't a real microscope and whatnot, but I feel that the lens could have at least been a more decent magnifier than it is.

"I just love this bracelet.

It came in a nice blue box, like others have said, the stickers do not remove easily for re-use, but you could always put your own sticker over it if you wanted to re-use the box.

Inside the box was a black suede drawstring pouch sitting atop the foamy padding in generally find in jewelry packing.

As for the bracelet itself, it's beautiful.  My 18 yr daughter loves it, so I imagine I'll be sharing.

It feels rather luxurious to be wearing all of these pearls, which are intertwined with a dark brown string and crystals.  The crystals have a great sparkle to them which adds an element of bling to the pearls.  The pearls are large in size, and definitely potato shaped.

The pearls do have markings on them which do appear to be from tools, many of the pearls are unmarked though and I don't feel like it distracts from the beauty.

As for the brown cord, it clearly shows the brown cord in the photos, so it's to be expected and I don't mind it one bit.

The size of the bracelet is a bit on the small size.  I am smaller boned and don't have tiny wrists, but they are probably smaller than average and I feel most comfortable using the extender when clasping the bracelet together.

All in all, this is a bracelet that I will wear a lot.  With the coloring you can easily wear it with jeans just as well as with a more glamorous outfit for a night out.",4.0,0

"This case is lightweight, feels good in the hands, and installation is as easy as described; just push the iPad gently into the inside and listen for the snaps.  Thats about all the good I can actually think of for this product, however.

This case's advertising is very, very misleading.  The description states that it provides a ""secure closure"" to the iPad for the auto wake and sleep functionality.  What it actually does is lay limp and lifeless across the face of the iPad like a drunkard on the floor at the end of a Christmas party, doing no one any real good whatsoever.  When I read ""secure closure,"" I thought that it meant that there were magnets in the corners of the cover that would provide a secure closure of the cover to the face of the iPad and actually protect the screen from scratches while traveling, like almost all iPad portfolio type cases provide.  I was sorely mistaken.

If you just want a cheap, lightweight yet relatively good looking case for your iPad Air, then sure it will probably make you very happy.  If your looking for a case that will actually do what it promises to do and actually provide a secure closure of the lid to the screen of the iPad, then no, this case will make you very angry and, given that the lid does not provide secure closure, this does not bode well for the iPad.

The only thing thats providing me ""secure closure"" in this transaction is that Amazon has a wonderful returns policy and I will be getting a full refund for the item so that way I can find an iPad portfolio case that does work as it should.",2.0,0

"I got this cover with the idea of having a spare in case I messed up removing material to make the Qi adapter fit better (trying to reduce the lump it makes). It fits nicely, and seems to be pretty thin (which I wanted). My only slight complaint is that it isn't exactly what I'd call RED red. It's more of a dusty red, or a very dark pink. Kind of rosy, perhaps? Anyways, it actually works out okay for me because it matches the red portion of my Supcase Unicorn Beetle black/red case very VERY well. It's really hard to match reds, and the red of the case isn't particularly red, either. However, the color of the case and cover are so close as to pretty much be the same, which is great for me. A tiny ring of red now peeks out around the case's camera hole. I'm about to upload a picture, check it out. I think it looks pretty damn good. On a side note, and it doesn't bother me at all for my purposes - the cover isn't exactly what I'd call rubberized. I was expecting something perhaps a little grippy and more textured, but the cover is basically just matte finish. If it's actually ""rubberized"", then it's the thinnest rubber coating I've ever seen. If I ordered this with the intention of not using it with a case and having a grippy rear cover, I'd be pretty upset. Really, for my own purposes this is a 5 star product, but I think if I didn't have this narrow use-case, I'd have called it 4 stars. So there ya go.",4.0,0

"I really thought this game looked silly at first - but once I got to playing it, it's amazingly fun! You get All Three new Episodes of the movies with this game!

The little lego guys are absolutely adorable, and when ships blow up, they disintegrate into their component lego parts. Lego fans will be thrilled to see little lego flowers, lego swinging doors, and much more. The game is pretty true to the story line, which is funny in and of itself, watching the famous Star Wars scene done lego-style. You jump, shoot and light-saber your way through the scenes. You get to use a variety of characters, and each character of course has his or her own special talents. There's a lot of coin-collecting, secret-finding and bad guy bashing. There's an optional two player mode which is great - someone else can grab a controller, play for a while, then drop out without any penalty at all. There's a regular story mode for going through the movie plotline, plus a free play where you can randomly switch between various players to solve some of the trickier puzzles. There's a good deal of replayability as you go back searching for the treasures, and trying to unlock all of the cool extra features. This is really perfect for the munchkins, but adults may find themselves playing it after the little ones are asleep because it's actually rather fun. I was impressed with the graphics too - the little legos walk as you might imagine they would, the floors shine with great reflections, the textures are just very nice.

"Once my daughter saw this at her 3rd birthday, she was not interested in anything else. This helps teach fine motor skills and my daughter caught on right away. She's doesn't quite understand to go from hole to hole in order - she wants to skip all over the board. Also - this is a great relaxing activity for a tired mom to sit with their child and point to which hole to go into next to teach the child.

There are pictures on both sides of the board and the board is sturdy. The animals that come in this are: dog, cat, turtle, rabbit, fish. Some cons that I've found just in the day we've had this are: the holes are NOT smooth so when the lace goes through the hole, it gets frayed a little and is sometimes difficult to pull through the hole. The lace doesn't get frayed enough to dissuade me from purchasing this though. Also, I think that lace should be a little longer. There is barely enough lace to go around the entire animal and with a toddler who doesn't understand to go from hole to hole, a longer lace would be nice.

Overall, I am happy with my purchase. My daughter loves this and it keeps her occupied for 30-45 minutes at a time and is great for a quiet activity at church or wherever. She loves the pictures and the wooden (rather than cardboard) pictures are perfect so we can get a lot of use out of this. Hope this review helps!",4.0,0

"Whoever designed this simple, yet CRITICAL piece of gear should be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.  I love my cattle dog mix, even though she is an on-the-go-pooper.  One every walk.  Usually within the first 5 minutes of a 30-45 minute walk.  Being a responsible dog owner, I carry the bags and then had to use that knot/leash hold maneuver to carry her deposit to a proper repository.  Two months ago, we adopted a second cattle dog mix and now I have a leash in each hand while I walk the poopingest dogs in the world.  Bag juggle??? Not so much.

So I searched for a solution and I found this simple, yet AMAZING solution.  It's durable and can't imagine it will take years for the rubber to stretch out and give way.  I have one for each leash making it much safer to walk them because I've got positive control of the leashes.  I sent one to my aunt and one to my mom for their dogs.  I suggested my dog walker to charge each client a one time fee to get one for each of her walking clients.

"It took some time to figure out how to put it on after reading other reviews about how it didn't work looped around the ring band and to just put it on first then put your ring on. I can tell you that putting the ring sizer band on first and then your ring was a big fail. It works better looped around the band and then slid the bands down your finger around the area the ring will sit, make sure the looped area on the ring is turned towards your palm side and then stretch the bands a bit to get you ring on and slide into place. The bands are comfortable but do peak out of the band, and I have a pretty wide ring. I keep tucking them back under the ring.

"I bought 3 of these - One small, one large, and one XL.  The large and XL fit my husky and Pit bull perfectly, but the small one, for my small 12 lb bichon mix was way too tight.  Maybe this is my misinterpretation, however, I think most folks would think a Small would fit a 12 lb dog w/ a small head and neck.  Other than the fact that I think it is mislabeled, (and the fact that the jingling bells will drive anyone crazy after a few minutes), I would give this item 5 stars.

"I built my desktop Windows machine in September 2007, and although it is still going strong with four 1. 5 TB Seagate hard drive in a RAID configuration, with only 4 GB of RAM (and less than that accessible on a 32-bit version of Windows Server 2003) it had hit a wall for the database development I do on Linux virtual machines with PostgreSQL. A consultant friend told me about the benefits of SSDs over hard drives for _random_ as opposed to sequential reads, so I decided to give it a try. The Samsung drive was trivial to install as an additional drive. I migrated my VMs to it, and they run dramatically faster on complex SELECT statements especially with multiple table joins. Then I took a few extra steps, which I cannot recommend too highly:  I moved my Windows paging file to the SSD, and made it larger (6 GB). Then I created \Temp and \Users\myname\Temp directories on the SSD, and pointed the global and local tmp and temp environment variables to them. What a difference!  Windows runs noticeably better on almost everything I do with it. The hard drive flashes furiously as always, but a lot of the time there is no sound of hard drive heads thrashing around. I believe the installation of the Samsung SSD postponed my need to build a new computer for at least a year, maybe three or more.",5.0,0

"We just got our first puppy about a month ago and did not realize how hard potty training would be. We live in an apartment and our puppy could not ""hold"" during his hourly trips to the elevator and outside, so we had to resort to an indoor potty. We first tried the scented pads- our pup would just play and shred them to pieces. We had a fake grass which worked well but it smelled really bad, clean up was a hassle and he was eating plastic bits. So when we came across DoggieLawn on Amazon, we decided to give it a try- at least he'll be eating real grass. It came on schedule in a prepackaged box, all you have to do is take off the lid, the grass was so green! Our puppy did his business on the grass immediately, but for the first few days there was a lot of grass eating and lounging on the pad.  You would need to supervise and make sure the dog is using it correctly. The best part is, there was no odor and no clean up! The urine gets absorbed in the grass pad and doesn't leak through the paper box. (we don't let him do #2 on the doggielawn). Also it's low maintenance- just spray with water a few times a week. We've had our doggielawn grass for a month now and it's time to change- it's turned brown and the odor is accumulating but it lasted longer than the 2 week period recommended by the company. Our pup has learned to go potty (#1) every time we put him on the grass. The downside is he was able to dig a small hole in the grass, however there's an option of getting an anti-dig mat which he haven't tried. Also, it is a bit expensive: $29 per one grass pad or a $50/month subscription for 2 pads. We'll keep getting these until he's fully potty trained!

We have a 10lb puppy and the standard size is perfect- there's enough room for him to circle and sniff.",4.0,0
"I was really surprised at the size and weight of this watch! I got it for my son who is very athletic, but he's not a big man! Tall, slender and fit...YES, but not bear-sized like one of the reviewers. :-) I feared that he wouldn't like it because of the size, but he certainly allayed that worry. He told me he even wore it while playing soccer and it was comfy, which surprised everyone.

Anyway, it's perfect for him and he loves it. We both agree that it's very attractive and sturdy. The green on the face adds just the right amount of eye-appeal without being flashy.

Truthfully, my son and I got into how ""pretty"" it is and how sports friendly, completely forgetting to comment on the accuracy of the time-piece...which is what any watch is all about, of course. :-) Well, when we finally got around to that, I learned that it's perfectly accurate. But with the INVICTA name, I'm not surprised.

No review of this watch would be complete without mentioning the packaging! You'd expect something like the Hope Diamond to be packaged like this:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Invicta-Men-s-6566-Subaqua-Noma-IV-Collection-Chronograph-Black-Polyurethane-Watch/dp/B004PJ1J4S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Invicta Men's 6566 Subaqua Noma IV Collection Chronograph Black Polyurethane Watch</a>&nbsp;comes in a jeweler's quality, bright-yellow box with a hinged lid and... Oh, it's just too lovely to describe... I hope you can get this and see for yourself.

Do study the manual that comes with it; makes it easier to understand the little intricacies of this phenomenal product.

Nothing else to say except that this is an amazing watch! Expensive, but well worth it because it's an upgrade from the other diver's watches on the market. Amazon's price can't be beat. (I saw the same brand at T.J. Maxx and even with their discount, it was much more than this.)

"For starters the head phones worked and were way better in staying in the ear when doing laps and flip turns. The packaging was great, and they came with all sorts of swap out buds for all different size ears. The problem and the reason I'm writing this review, is I noticed that about 2 weeks after receiving them and using them in my daily 1 mile swim, that one of the headphones was barely working. I thought it may be due to water getting in my ear and drowning out the noise. This wasn't the problem because the very next day the ear bud stop working permanently.  I found that i can get the broken side to work if i bend the wire that plugs into the Ipod.

"I'm a photojournalist and bought this monitor after my old 21"" CRT died. I've been very pleased with the HP W2408H over the last couple of weeks, but it does need calibration. If you are a gamer or general user, you will love the brilliant picture straight out of the box. For photographers and editors, the colors are too bright and saturated, too ""juicy"" for critical use.

I uninstalled the monitor's software, dragged out my venerable $100 Pantone ColorVision ColorPlus (the consumer colorimeter sensor for monitors) and it gave me a nice, clean image in minutes. A worthwhile investment for anyone.

The monitor's wide-screen real estate makes editing hundreds of photos quite a bit easier than with the old square CRT. It also uses less power and produces less heat than a CRT, a nice plus these days. The image is smooth, even and neutral with calibration. Like any LCD, though, you do need to view the screen ""on axis.""

Just to verify what others have said, the built-in speakers are total garbage: weak, tinny, and pointed out the rear so you cannot hear what little sound they do produce. You definitely need external speakers.

With the exception of the crummy speakers and the iffy calibration software, the monitor is excellent. Five stars.",5.0,0

"My dogs are fairly rough on toys - very few last for more than a week, and many die within a day or two. Obviously I am not alone in this: anyone reading this review is likely looking for a solid, durable toy which will survive the rough play of a chewer or large breed dog (or both).

This ball is not solid, and it is not durable.

The ball looks exactly like the 4.5"" model of a ""Soft & Tough Clutch"" ball I purchased last year. The cyan colored 6"" Soft & Tough Clutch that I purchased is easily my dogs' favorite toy, and has survived for many months now (I think I bought it in November) with nary a scratch. I decided to purchase a second ball because they loved it so much, and I went for the 4.5"" grape ball the next time around.

I took it out of the package and I could immediately feel the difference in the texture. I can't quite explain it, but the Soft & Tough feels exactly how its name describes it. This ball felt soft and rubbery, like the cheap $3-$5 Walmart toys I used to buy before I realized that they only lasted 10 minutes. The difference: this ball didn't even make it 10 minutes.

In less than 3 minutes, my dogs had begun taking chunks off of the ball and it had to go to the trash can. Put another way: prorated out, I was paying about $180/hour for this dog toy!!!

Bottom line: I am not sure if I got an imitation/knock-off, or if the balls are made by different companies. They look the same and are advertised the same on Amazon, but there was a clear and discernible difference in texture between the two balls, and that translated into the difference between a long-time favorite toy, and a 3-minute pile of garbage.

So buyer beware: the ""Soft & Clutch"" line earns 5 stars and then some, while the Soft-Flex ball is solidly in the ""don't waste your money on this"" category.",1.0,0

"I picked the ""Small"" size. For the review I chose ""Fits as expected"" but that's not EXACTLY true. The sleeves seem a bit too short for my liking, the body a bit too long for my liking. Perhaps that evens things out! But the overall size is nice, not too baggy and not too tight. Maybe a bit baggier than I'd like - it looks just like the picture - I could go for something a tad more form fitting.

The sleeves are a bit short for my liking; raising my hands up pointing ahead of me results in about 3 inches of arm are exposed.

The body length is a bit too long for my liking by about 2-3 inches. I was worried this would be very form fitting and thus wouldn't allow for a heavier shirt underneath. But the the small fits me about the way shown in the product picture. There's room for a sweater/sweatshirt.

The areas with fleece are warm, soft and comfortable. The sleeves do not have a fleece lining but they too are very comfortable - after all, arms move a lot so having a thinner material makes for easier movement. Nice.

I would not mind if it was a BIT more form fitting, it's ever so slightly frumpy (again as seen in the product photo).

Aside from the sizing.. it's still very comfortable. Has ties to make it a bit smaller, a nice little hood that doesn't fall over my eyes, the fleece is super soft and comfortable and made me noticeable warmer in a cool room.

"This game is a mixture between worker placement and area control.  Each turn players place their workers on a variety of different spaces that discover and populate parts of the ""New World"", collect trade goods, specialist workers, and battle opponents.

It can be compared to Dominant Species where worker placement is also used to manage the area control mechanics of a game.  I didn't really care for that game and I don't like this one much better.  I do like it a little better because it doesn't seem as abstract as Dominant Species.  The one slightly original mechanic of this game are the specialist workers that provide bonuses based on what action spaces they are placed in.

I think I just need to stop playing these older games so long after their release because I tend not to like them with a few exceptions.  Worker placement has been refined so much and knocked out of the park by so many games since this came out that this game just seems kind of bland and samey even if it was original at the time it was released.  Even the mechanic I labeled as ""slightly original"" where you can acquire different kinds of workers with special abilities has been done and done better by several other games since.

All in all this game was simply bland.  The worker placement piece, which with how much I like worker placement should have been my favorite piece, just seemed ancillary and unnecessary to the area control piece.  The special buildings you could buy didn't do anything very interesting and all of this made the game kind of bland.  The worst was that there was very little to do by the end game, especially the final turn.

It wasn't all bad though.  There are multiple legitimate paths to victory and lots of interesting decisions to make.  It's just not something that has stood the test of time.",3.0,0

"I have went through the mess of choosing new heaters and most really are not very good. This one is very good. It is simple, it takes up small space, and temperature has worked spot-on for the first couple of months. It lays sideways, so you can put it low in the back of aquarium and not see it if you want. It has a nice temperature gage and different lights come on when it is in session. It is not digital, but really who cares? You should always have another thermometer in there to check. Have the one on your heater, and then one of the $1.50 ones you can get at any petshop. Who says your fancy digital one is correct you scummy digital heater buyers!",5.0,0
"I've had this shape wear for nearly one year.  It probably does run a tad small but it also needs to be snug to do its job.  I am short- 5'2""- and (was) 40ish lbs overweight so I ordered the L.  It fit very well with no riding up or sliding down at all.  There are no lines visible on your clothes to even hint that you're wearing something like this.  I ended up ordering another in the 2nd color & wear one or the other most days. It hasn't seemed to wear out in any way with numerous washings over the year.  In fact, drying them helps them regain snugness.  After a decent weight loss, it obviously doesn't work quite as well but I like the product enough to order both colors in a smaller size, perhaps even a couple of each.  They are comfortable and just help me feel sleeker, whether it's under a business suit, dress, or jeans!  Honestly, I feel wrong going without them now.  Compared to most effective shape wear, you simply cannot beat the price.  At my height, it does pull up to my bra line, which seems appropriate to me.

I definitely recommend this to anyone wanting to smooth out their shape & just feel slimmer!",5.0,0

"This purchase was a nice replacement for my older Garmin nuvi 350.  I paid about $120 on sale for this unit and paid nearly $300 for the older nuvi 350.  For starters, the free Lifetime update was very nice.  For my Garmin nuvi 350, I had to purchase the map updates card for about $95.  The screen on this unit is thinner and a little larger.  I was pleased to discover the a/c vent attached mount my daughter bought years ago still works with this Garmin.  I can't yet tell if the Traffic feature is available in my area, at least I haven't been rerouted yet.  I do like that this model tells you roughly what lane to be in for a turn or exit coming up.  I could see where that would be helpful driving in areas like California.  The feature that provides your traveling speed in the lower left is kind of annoying.  I don't know why I would use that if I have a working speedometer and it's not that accurate.  I think I can change that to display the distance to the destination. It boots up faster and does a better job of detecting the satellites. I'm very pleased with it and think it was a terrific value for the money.

I put the older Garmin nuvi 350 in the kids' car.  Utah commonly has addresses like 348 East 500 North. Addresses are indexed from the center of each town.  Once the teenagers figured out that Garmin just wants the 348 for the address and 500 for the street, which then gives you options to choose 500 North or 500 South, they use it whenever driving to someplace new.",5.0,0

"This little tea set just makes no sense to me.  The tea pot doesn't actually open, so you can't actually pour water into it.  Ok, fine.  It does make a cool pouring sound, but only randomly.  Most of the time it just bursts into song when tipped, and then makes the pouring sound when you bump it with your elbow or something.  It would have been awesome to have the option of turning the music off and just having the pouring sound to play ""tea"" with.  The songs are just strange and annoying anyways.  The cups too, while cute, have two holes drilled on one side.  So, heaven forbid your child actually pour liquid in, if they happen to try to drink from that side the liquid will just pour out of the side of the cup onto their lap before it even reaches their mouth.  The cake stacker thingy is actually pretty cute and fun.  And, my kids love this little set and mix it in with their other kitchen toys.  It was a gift, so we will keep it, but I would not have purchased this for them on my own.  I feel like the makers of this set assume that kids need constant electronic stimulation to keep them entertained, but I think the opposite is actually true. I think a plain, non-verbal, no batteries required set is so much better to encourage open-ended play.",3.0,0

"I am a special educator and purchased this product to begin teaching one of my students to complete jigsaw puzzles.  Most jigsaw puzzles on the market contain at least eight pieces whereas this set includes four different four-piece jigsaw puzzles.  The limited number of pieces make this product a perfect tool for introducing jigsaw puzzles!  I will continue to use this product in the future, both for my students and my own child.

I have removed one star for two reasons:

1.  The illustrations on the puzzles leave a bit to be desired.  I think that brighter images would be more interesting and motivating for young learners.

2.  All four puzzles are within one board (with a frame around each).  I have found that this is distracting and confusing for some children.  I think this set could be improved by separating the puzzles onto individual boards.

One more note:  This may be considered a pro or con, depending on how you intend to use the product.  The outline of each puzzle piece is drawn onto the wooden frame beneath it.  This may serve as a helpful prompt for some children, as they can match the shapes of the pieces.  However, if you are a teacher or therapist who is measuring independence, this feature may be problematic for you.

Overall, I think this is a useful product and would purchase again.",4.0,0

"Another brain-damaged design by Sony - a well-built, almost completely perfect device crippled to the point of being worthless by a small oversight.

This device starts tracks at the beginning after it powers off and you turn it back on.  This makes it a definite no-go for most people as it can't be used for long files such as audio books.

I contacted SonyStyle support before buying because the specs didn't indicate that it would resume tracks at the current point, and I wanted to know for sure before I bought it.  I have had a history of items from Sony that are like that - designed and tested by engineers, but completely untouched by non-techie consumers.  SonyStyle support assured me that it would resume tracks at the current point when powered off.  After buying and receiving the item, I couldn't find anything in the instructions about how to resume at current point, so I called SonyStyle again.  After 45 minutes of insisting that it would do it and attempting to do it on his, the tech finally admitted that it wouldn't.  It would only restart the current track.  He also couldn't give an ETA on a firmware update that would allow this.  So, (thanks Amazon), I sent it back. No more Sony for me.

It may be fixed at some point in the future by a firmware update, but caveat emptor.

For those that care, the players I found that do allow resume AND have PlaysForSure (no iPods here):

Creative Zen Stone (PERFECT device, awesome in every aspect)
Sandisk Sansa (AAA battery; when it dies you lose your place)
Samsung YPZ5 (cool but clunky, kind of expensive)

The bottom line is that professional work requires professional tape, and professional tape doesn't get better than this. This tape is incredibly reliable, and perfect for archiving.

It fits nice in My Lanbox Lite with just enough room between my fan and the PSU. I was originally gettting the Blue Orb II, but on the day my item was suppose to be delivered, I got an email from Amazon stating that the item was out of stock and they had to refund me.

Anyway, the fan looks, sounds, and cools ALOT better that the stock intel fan that I originally had there. I have a Intel Core 2 Quad Q6600. With Stock, temps were 44c idle, as high as mid 60s load. With this, 36 idle, 50 load. I call that improvement considering the noise difference.

Edit: After further use, I used the 2 60mm fans that are placced the the inside to the outside of the vents to suck out the heat that lingers in that area (most likely due to the heat coming off of the cpu and out of the PSU that is DIRECTLY above the CPU fan.

- My son really liked this rash guard/sunscreen top.

- If ordering again, he would probably order two sizes up from his normal size.

Read about it carefully before deciding. I did, but still convinced myself it was worth the outrageous amount of money (for an -opoly game). Boy was I wrong!  Now I just have to find somewhere to try to sell it so I don't feel guilty saddling someone else with it.",2.0,0
"I had a chance to listen to these at a local audio shop. I wasn't too impressed at all. Really disappointing sound quality considering the price. The mids are what's really bad I think--they have a tin-can quality to them that's not pleasant or realistic. This is common in the Beats line, I think the Studios are slightly better but they have other issues. For the same price or less, you could get some really great headphones. Check out AKG's Q-701, or Sennheiser Amperiors, or Audio-Technica M50's, or Shure 840's. They're all much more realistic sounding with clearer mids, smooth highs, and tight realistic bass. You'll learn to love and appreciate the more realistic sound other headphones provide, and your wallet will appreciate it too.",2.0,0

I know that taller women often have issues finding leggings of a decent length but these would be great if you are taller! The color is not a dark black but more of a smoky black. Super comfy and the pockets are an added plus so they look more like pants but have the elastic waistband of leggings.

"The prduct description for these toys says they are ""ecologically responsible"".  I personally don't think killing animals for leather is an ecologically responsible action.  If you love your pets enough to buy them lots of nice toys, then you're an animal lover like myself.  If you love animals as much as I do, then you're probably a vegetarian and don't use animal products like leather.  When I purchased these cat toys I was not aware that they were made with leather because the product description omits this detail.  As soon as I opened the box from Amazon and saw the genuine leather fish heads I was absolutely furious!  Why on earth would I want one animal to suffer - a cow used for its hide - so that I can provide a play toy for another animal - my cat?  I would never kill a cat to use its hide to make a toy for a cow!!

I did end up keeping the toys because I didn't want to deal with returning them - which would also be ecologically irresponsible with the resources going in to the shipping process.  Also, one of my cats absolutely loves feather toys which was the main reason I purchased these in the first place, so I gave him the fishies and he loves them.  They aren't the most popular toys in the kitty basket, but they haven't gone unused.  If my cats are really hyper and I toss the fishies in the air for them they will go after them, but if the toys are just laying there the cats don't go up to them and start playing with them.

I would not recommend these toys to a friend and I would not purchase them again.  If, however, the materials were changed to a faux leather or other man-made material, I would be happy to give a better review/rating.",2.0,0
"Not even sure I should really give this 3 stars. It had absolutely no effect on my cat. I can't say it was ""bad"" so I gave it the 3 just as a point of neutrality, which is to say nothing happened. Cats are funny though- maybe it's just my cat. I tried it, but she didn't even raise her nose or twitch a whisker. It certainly didn't entice her into her box. I suspect she had other issues for a while (it may be an age thing) that has made her box habits slip. Mostly now she's using it again (without using this product) - although she tends to favor one corner so much it's a bit of a problem, and sometimes over-shoots or just stops on the edge and wees outside of the box. We clean it regularly, at least once a day as a rule so whatever! I had hoped this might get her to be more drawn into the box and use it more evenly and more reliably but again- no effect whatsoever. $9 wasted. Probably end up composting it.",3.0,0

"We got a new swing set and needed a few swings for it. I had a baby bucket seat but my 2yo wanted her own big girl seat. I picked up another seat a few days before this one so will be comparing the two. The other one was $7 more so will take that into consideration.
This seat says that it will hold up to 250lbs and so does the other one. One thing that this one says on the bag is that it is meant for 3-10 yo. Also it is just a plain green swing and the other one has information on the backside. The other one has more plastic underneath so it looks heavier and stronger. The chains are both the same length and commercial grade and covered with a yellow plastic coating for comfort and safely.
Overall I am very satisfied with this swing. It is perfect for our play set and the girls love it. I think that the other swing is slightly better than this one but just by a hair.

"Absolutely no customer service, try googling for a company website and you will not find a result. First, after opening the box there was 1 landing skid missing. Second, I tried the propeller guards on and spun the propellers by hand and one for the propellers would rub against the guard. So I tried charging the battery and was going to fly it without propeller guards, landing skids, and without the camera. Plugged the battery in and the drone never got power, no signal to the transmitter either. Tried calling their customer service (which was found on groupon) and they ask to send an email or leave a message. First I tried wrinting an email and after a week I never received a response, then tried calling and leaving a message and after 2 weeks I never received a response. THERE IS NO CUSTOMER SERVICE! Beware of this hoax company. I will now try and google for company webpages before making any further purchases, regarding drone manufacturers. The cherry on top, after handling the body of the drone, the company name smeared from the palm of my hand. Very cheap and not worth the money. This would have been my 5th drone to play with, I have also built my own drones as well. Never had any other issues with other quadcopter companies. Since you can't find a company address or contact a customer service representative, I will probably order a new flight contoller and get it to fly myself, would hate the whole investment to go in the garbage.",1.0,0

"I purchased one of these at Wal-Mart for $10.00. In my 50's now I always wanted to have one. I don't know why some people had issues or put it down. First off I sent for the ants which cost another $5.00 for S&H right through the website. It took 10 days to receive them, keep in mind if you live somewhere it's cold or too hot you will wait longer. After receiving the ants, only one dead one, I followed the instructions closely. First making 4 starter tunnles with the tool and then cooling down the ants in the fridge for 15 minutes then putting them in. It took less the 24 hours and the ants started working. Each ant has different jobs. Some dig, some remove debris and some just stand guard near the lid. Someone reviewed it didn't light up well; maybe they didn't put batteries in it! Mine lighted up well! The only hard part to this is the fact you have to put the whole farm in the refrigerator for at least 75 minutes to slow the ants up to clean out the debris as they are very fast and will try to escape. I have it 3 weeks so far and lost maybe 5 ants as they do die off and do not lay eggs since there is no queen. Like any other creature sometimes they dig other times they rest.  I do believe its fun to watch and well worth the 10 bucks. I guess I'm a kid at heart, get one and enjoy the fun!",4.0,0

"I have 6 cats and this is the most popular treat yet.  I have to be careful to be fair and divert the more agressive cats or they will fight over them.  My old cat is the one with the bad coat but it has been improving very well with these.  She also gets a joint supplement one.  Her coat is filling out nicely and she is looking a lot better, much less ragged.  These don't bother any of my cats, even my puke queen who throws up with every new thing.  I've had NO episodes of tummy upset with any of the cats.
They are little fish shaped treats, brown, and feel moist to the touch.  I would suggest having another bag of treats nearby that they can have extras of, because they want more than one. They are only supposed to eat one treat each a day, but my cats got in my desk drawer and drug the treat bags out.  This one was the one they wanted- they chewed a HOLE in it and got a few of the treats out.  They were all ok though.  They didn't get the whole bag, but just a few, I guess 5 or 6 maybe they managed to chew out of the bag, which is a heavy plasticy-foil bag with a zip top.  The top held well so they just tried to get in the bag.  IF the bag had been paper or a bag like party treats came in, I've no doubt they would have ate the whole bag.

"Fitting that the first release of Risk Europe is replete with Euro style gaming techniques and rules.  This isn't simple, old school Risk... (Ukraine is weak!!!), but a new, fresh, updated version with several new rules.  I hope they release some additional twists on classic Risk, such as an Asian edition with focus on Korea, Japan, and China.

Players don't strive to eliminate opponents.  Instead players try to collect crowns to become the Emperor of Europe.  Each player selects their starting city and draws two orders from their eight.  These dictate the actions the player will be undertaking during their turn.  Players acquire money, build castles, build units, and attack opposing players.

Combat is slightly different than classic Risk as well.  It is more thought out with players forced to use more strategy in battle.

Overall this is a well balanced game with a lot of more involved player participation.  Players don't get eliminated, making it more fun over the long term than classic Risk (for those eliminated players especially).  Components are high quality.  And Ukraine (Galicia) is still weak!

Recommended.  Great for Euro gamers or those wanting a more complex American style board game to bridge that gap between American and Euro games.",5.0,0
Initially I was going to get the burgundy color one but they didn't have my size. I am glad I got the blue instead. As it was a nice purchase. It doesn't look like the picture provided by the seller.

However this is one of those products that even if I didn't get a discount I would think it was a nice purchase. Just a heads up for style purpose. If you like the modern and slim fit than the sizing should be normal. I got my size and it fit just right. Not sure how it will come out after I wash it though. If you like your sweaters to fit a little loser than get a size up. That's my suggestion and input.,5.0,0
"I did return mine - I have all tile floors with room rugs, and being semi-retired and self-employed from home I spend a lot of time in my slippers walking on the tile. The original cork built-up soles on the OG clogs are perfect for this whereas when I wear this Charisma with it's soft thinner sole in comparison it SEEMS I can almost feel the floor though the sole. That means not enough support for wearing them 10-12 hours a day every day. DANG it I love them and they were only $42 from Warehouse Deals....I do wish they had worked out! If you like the look I would encourage you to try them out and see for yourself how they feel. As a general house slipper, especially on wall to wall padded carpeting and just light use in morning, evening and weekends I bet they'd be GREAT.

DETAILS: Charisma is unmistakably a slipper (as opposed to a clog that could be worn as a shoe). Charisma has a snug fit - the size 42 for women's size 11 had my toe pushing right up at the top. Bear in mind one of my feet is 10.5 and the other 11 - the 10.5 foot thought the length was perfect. The fabric is very soft with some give and they actually felt OK even with my toes nicely wrapped up - for the 10 minutes I tried.  Like the OG clog style, these do have the molded foot bed with the slightly built up arch support. They are nowhere near as tough and stiff as the OG clog style; the sole is thinner and more flexible especially at the toes which are not bulbous and padded as are the OG clog style. The bottom of these soles are covered in thin ""grips"" that mildly keep them from slipping on tile so I would say these are not for use outdoors - much.",5.0,0

He loves monkeys, so this toy is perfect for him.

While I like learning toys, sometimes you just want a fun toy to play with.  This one accomplishes both - it is really fun and there is an opportunity to learn colors and improve fine motor control.  The inside gears are in the same colors as the flashing lights.  The outside gears are in similar colors.  You can play match the colors or you can mix them up on purpose.  I also noticed that the little balls that come with his other toys can sit atop the spinning gears and the balls spin, too!  Add to that the gears and knobs are just the right size for his one year old hands and he likes to chew them as he is now teething his last two canine teeth (he's already got 14 of his teeth) and the gears seem to hit just the right spot for those last two.

The toy is a lot more fun that I expected and I would not hesitate to give it as a gift or to buy for the little one in your life.",5.0,0

"Anyone thinking that the quality of a $15 dummy gun should be up to expectations of quality to a $500 prop replica is a bit ridiculous. This thing is made up of two halves that are glued/screwed in place (mine had a very tiny gap, but didn't matter since it's just for an accessory to my trooper armor until I get a better one on order). The trigger does NOT move. It's a dummy costume gun, nothing more. Some black spray paint can fix it right up for a quick make-do E-11 (inaccurate, but better followed by than the Hasbro). It's worth about $10 personally due to absolutely no functionality in movement, but for what I needed it for it will be fine.

"For an action figure like this, where the ""main attraction"" revolves around the use of the blaster in his hand, I feel it does not meet the build quality in comparison to the rest of the toy.

The toy itself is detailed, and is sturdy enough for a 3 year old to have many hours of fun with. The blaster? Not so much. It stopped serving it's purpose within about 2 weeks.

Overall, the toy is not a bad purchase by any means, and pretty much becomes an essential action figure once your child sees Toy Story 2 for the first time, but if you do purchase, just be aware that the blaster is flimsy.",3.0,0

What I wish someone told me before I wasted $9.95 on this:

It is small enough but for it's size the level of light is very poor. To give you something to compare it to, If I need more light I would prefer the flashing light app on my iPhone, that is brighter.

So what is this good for? If I need a little night lite I can turn this on and not worry about waking up my wife where my iPhone may be a little too bright.

I does serve a purpose, I am rating low because it does not serve the purpose for which I purchased it and wish someone else posted this over the 5 star reviews I read. Maybe they used to be brighter and better but in January 2015 this is little more than a child's toy.",2.0,0
"For those of you who are an avid tennis player and know how to turn a heel, you may be wondering how the foot bed works.  The basic idea is to place your foot on the side of the heel and then your foot stays on the bottom of the shoe.  The foot bed is a little more comfortable than most other shoes I have purchased, but you can definitely adjust your foot bed if you want.  I am not sure if I will be able to wear these again for a couple of weeks, but I am very pleased with these shoes.

However, the toe bed does have a little extra room for your feet.  This is not to mention the fact that the color is lighter than I thought.  It is a dark brown and I am guessing it will be darker than the picture.  However, the toe bed is a little wider than I thought.  I wear a 9.5 and my 9.5 is wide.

"We previously had the Tetra Waterfall Globe which was pretty, until the extremely thin glass shattered in my hands during a cleaning. So... enter our new tank (and new fish, sadly our old betta met an unfortunate - not tank related - end)...

We have a fancy goldfish that is absolutely loving his new tank, as are we.  He's been in his home for a week, his water is still crystal-clear, and the tank was a breeze to set up and maintain.  I honestly couldn't be happier.  My only (slight) concern is that the tank goes get a tiny bit warm when the light is on (up to about 76/78) so it's not perfectly ideal for goldfish if you want the light on all the time, as apparently they prefer a bit cooler water.

There's plenty of room to play with decorating (I have the 5gal hex), and I'm just itching to go buy at least a snail & couple of tiny companions for Turkey-the-Goldfish because this is such an enjoyable tank you really want to take advantage of it.

The stock ones do a good job of keeping the truck from flipping at high speed turns but overall they wear out fast and need replacing. Proline has a great line of tires and woke my truck up a lot. I ran mine on a 2s battery for a long time, for trailing and bashing that's plenty quick and will prolong your parts. I did recently start running 3s and geared it up.

Every single hobby store that I've gone to has parts. All that aside the reason I give them five stars is not only are there line of RC vehicles really good but their customer service can't be touched. They are simply amazing. Anytime I've had questions they've been super nice and answer them, anytime I needed parts that were still under warranty they shipped me new ones immediately, any time I had any question about upgrades they were absolutely awesome.

"Nice case.  Swallowed a Sabertooth x99 with H100 water cooler with only very minor hiccups.

Pros:
- very easy to assemble
- Can work with H100i cooling unit with 2 fans
- has rubber grommets for H100i
- decent cable management
- adjustable position of rear fan
- room for additional front fan
- padding to absorb sound on sides
- removable filters front and bottom

Cons:
- top cover must be left off if using water cooler (ugly --see photo) would prefer a 2 piece cover of some kind
- No fan control
- only 2 usb ports on front
- Should have top cutout for 12v MoBo power (was a stretch)
- Tight fit for water unit near Top hdd cage

I think it would take an h110i (has holes for 140mm mounting, but no grommets), but wouldn't guarantee.  As it is the fans just clear the motherboard and the top 2 drive bays can't be used for full length drives with a h100i installed.

I like that the case allowed all the wiring to be run behind the mobo, but running the 12v cable was a tight fit and pushes up against the RAM slots at the right edge.  It would be nicer if there had been a cutout at the top of the mobo to allow a straight run behind.  Cutting it myself seemed like too much work given that the cable fit as is.",4.0,0

"Before I got this device I needed three remotes to control my tv/home theater system. Now that I have it I need... three remotes to control my tv/home theater system.
I'll give them one of the controllers - only my tv's original remote controls aspect ratio (my educational dvds are in 4:3) and I am unaware of universals that fulfill that function.
But this remote won't allow me to change the input on my receiver. I still need the original receiver remote to do that. If there is a way to do it, I haven't figured it out. And although the manual says they are ready to assist by phone or emai, they don't answer the phone, nor emails.
btw, if you set up the power button to punch through and turn on more than one device, you have to learn the timing. If you press the button too quickly the entire macro won't run and not all devices will turn on. If you press it too long the macro will continue running and turn some devices back off. In either case you will be out of sync, and can only get back in sync manually (or by using an original remote) to get the devices lined up in the proper on/off state as designed by your macro.
  I'll keep the remote because the power button on the original receiver remote has gone south and I need that functionality. Otherwise this remote solves no problems for me, and now I have to operate the system for those family members who are not ""technical"".",2.0,0

"Love this watch. I've got several of their AMW320 and also AMW330 series, and I'm very pleased with all of them. This also comes in a gold version with gold bezel and a white-face version with stainless bezel. I have both.

I consider this a dressy 'snorkel' watch, good for active sports but also dressy enough for a conservative office. The dive bezel works smoothly but moves in both directions, so it's not designed for true Scuba...however I've snorkeled with this down to 20-25 feet and no problems, so it's definitely waterproof for all non-Scuba uses.
Time adjustment is simple. The luminescent hands are quite bright when you first come in from the sun, they seem to last about an hour before fading, so they're for casual use but not, say, serious spelunking. That said, they're easy to read in all light levels against the black. It's a great watch at twilight because you can still clearly read the dial. The second hand is also easy to read in all light levels.

This is a quietly handsome watch at a great price. Solid, reliable like every Casio, but unpretentious.
I've worn mine as a general outdoors sports/beach/knockaraound watch, and it still looks great.
The crystal is completely un-scratched despite some pretty careless treatment.

I'm totally pleased with both of mine. Check out the gold face version as well, and look at the AMW320 series also (same watch style but with a digital time/day/date inset). The AMW320's are equally attractive, affordable and reliable. I have a couple of those too.

There's nothing not to like about this watch. The rubber factory band is fine, but these all really look good on a nylon Nato strap (if you're not familiar with those, google it).

First, documentation was almost non-existent. You will need to ""fill in the gap"", to figure out where all the screws go.  Most of the time, I had to improvise and even use some nuts and bolts from my own tool kit.

Second, the mount did not fit Optoma HD131Xe.  I played around with different configuration options, and finally had to bend one of the arms, and put some holes in another, just to make it fit.

Third, the sliding arm design is very poor.  There is very limited range of adjustment (15 degrees according to the manual, but more like 10 degrees), and adjustment screws are very hard to reach.

"I am very disappointed in this product.  And, I'm disappointed in myself for not calling Dremel within the first year of getting it and complaining.
First I'll describe my disappointment when it RAN:
--  its heavy
--  its noisy - scares both my dogs.  The less ""sophisticated"" pedi-paw is easier to use and not as noisy.
-- battery charge didn't last long.
Second, when it didn't run:
-- I'd plug it into the charger and into the wall.  It appeared to charge, but upon using it, within minutes it would lose power again.

In the 3 years since I originally purchased this product on Amazon, I have used it only a few times.  I just recently saw it in the ""dog grooming box"" and thought, ""Hey, let me try this again, before I throw it out"".  Plug it into charger and into the wall, and nothing.  No light, nada.

So I call Dremel Customer service and explain the general problem I've had with this product since the beginning and asked if based on these symptoms, it is the charger, the battery or both?

The answer was disappointing too.  No idea.  You'd think there would be some experience with this set of problems.
The cost of replacing both the charger and the battery is more than buying a new one at Walmart.
She did suggest sending it into Dremel and explaining and maybe they would do something about it.
I considered that, but spending another $5 or so on shipping for a product that really wasn't very good in the first place is just not worth it.

Maybe the product I received was a lemon compared to all the other great reviews out there.  But still, I found it way too noisy to be useful on an animal.

"LOVE THIS COVER!! The quality is excellent and I love that it covers not only the back seat, but also the sides of the back seat, the floor, and the backs of the front seats. Before I got this cover, I had old blankets trying to protect my leather seats from 2 large labs!  And any other covers I purchased didn't fit well and ended up useless.  It has great coverage, awesome high-quality material, and is easy to install. Can be done in 5 minutes, or even less if you are in a rush and you skip some of the steps that fully secure it. There are many straps, buckles, ties, and fittings that attach it around headrests (rear seats and the front seats), tie around the seat belts, and fabric fittings that are meant to slip in the back of the seat and the sides of the vehicle as well as between the bottom of the seat and the back of the seat so that it does not slide around too much. It fits well in my Lexus ES350.  This does the trick of protecting the leather from their nails.  I especially like the generous flap that connects to the front seats and then hangs down to the floor to keep their hair contained, instead of flying all over.  I ordered the grey even thought my interior is tan.  I couldn't tell if I would like the tan shown in the pictures and I also have grey in other areas of my car so it blends well.  It was very easy to install but haven't figured out how to get the back of it to stay in place better but I feel like there is a way with a little help from my husband.  The main function is to keep the seat protected from their nails since I have the perforated leather that can easily be torn. I would definitely recommend!

"So my daughter gets this and immediately goes nuts over it.  She loves to mix stuff up from her Build A Bear outfits to her old easy bake oven.

She brings it to her latest slumber party and of course, six 10 year old girls go gaga.

Pros:
Easy to open
Makes ""signature scents"" as quoted by my daughter.
The scents don't last which sounds like a con but half a dozen girls all smelling like a flower shop tends to mess up the allergies.
I read the directions.  It was a snap to combine.

"This is a rather surprising purchase in several ways.  This sandal is soft gold colored,  lightweight, soft plastic but substantial enough with an innersole. The thong strap is comfortable for all day use. The foldable aspect is no problem. You are not aware of the foldable feature when wearing them. It comes with 2 very substantial bands to hold each sandal in a folded position or as a pair with one band. I rather like the bright color bands! The flip-flops have their own durable just the right size zip carryall bag in black with a nice embroider front. Each sandal can be fold in half and banded or unfold and banded as a pair in the bag.

"(My picture shows LeapPad WITH the gel skin case on-sold separately)
My 3.5 year old son loves his ""tablet!"" We have cartridge games, and have purchased games directly on the tablet. Super easy to navigate. The camera, video recorder, and voice recorder are actually his favorite features. I cannot compare this tablet to other LeapPads, as this is the first one we have owned, but we do love it. It seems the biggest difference is this tablets ability to play imagicard games. We personally found the cards are nuisance, and don't use them. You don't even really need them,  but we do love the Paw Patrol Imagicard game...we just play without the cards. We did have an issue with it freezing on us once, but we're able to reset, and it's never done that again. A real tablet like an iPad obviously runs faster, has a better resolution, and more features, but the LeapPads are Ad free, which means this Mommy is worry free! I hated all the ads and pop-ups that occurred when my son plays games on our tablet or phones. Everything he plays on the LeapPad is educational, unlike many of the pointless games he played on the iPad. I also scored my tablet right before Christmas for around $65 dollars! That's right, this LeapPad platinum cost me $65! I price watched using CamelCamelCamel.com. So in short, certainly no iPad, but much more clean educational entertainment than an iPad....so IMO a better purchase!",5.0,0

"We adopted my our Boston Terrier puppy at almost 9 months old and she came to us having ""not been trained"" which meant that she had trained herself to, among other things, pull pull pull on her leash. Our dog trainer recommended the Easy Walk harness since the back-harness actually encourages the pups to pull more. It helped almost instantly! Every time she pulled, she would get the ""quick-stop"" that we were giving her before but also a very uncomfortable turn-around that she did herself. It's only 2 months later and the puppy who ""doesn't walk well on a leash"" (so they said) is getting better and better every day - she walks with a slack leash 75% of the time and when she does pull, it's not the constant force to go forward but rather the ""Hey! There's something over there I want to smell! [yank] Oh, right..."" Small dogs, large dogs, this is what you want!",5.0,0

"I've had this model for several years and was delighted to find a replacement(s) on Amazon.  They are BIG and 2 of them are perfect for our 4 indoor cats.  I remove the flap in front *and* the upper part of the flap on top (needs some muscling to remove the latter).  2/3s of one of the 38lb green plastic containers of litter from CostCo fills it somewhat deeply.  I clean once a day and backfill litter as necessary.  I do not use the locking mechanisms (see removing flaps!).  One plus to this container is that I have a cat that -tho fixed- occasionally likes to pee while semi-standing up (not true spraying).  The back of the bottom pan is higher than the front which really helps.

Forgot - If you have a very large cat, removing the top part of the flap is key....

LATER 2/28/16 - decided to keep the top part for one box as our female cat is shyer .... ALSO .... you will get a teench of leakage if a tall cat stands absolutely upright to pee (maybe I should have kept both top portions?)  I also plan to try a ""top entry"" box for the schnook.",5.0,0

"I've installed SmartThings in my home about a week ago and it already feels a waste of money. The original ads looked promising, but they have just one problem: little of this will work for you. The main problem of this kit is that you're very unlikely to force it doing anything useful.

THE GOOD
-Sensors and the hub look better than many other plastic junk boxes out there.
-The customer support works great. +1 star for that.
-Bundled ""things"" are very easy to connect.
-It sometimes works.

THE BAD
-The app has a decent look, but a terrible design: it's very confusing and often feels stupid.
-To make things worse the app will prompt you to buy extra stuff without being able to run a single scenario.
-Scenarios (here they're called apps) are both useless and confusing. Just need to pair a motion sensor and light? Good luck finding an easy way to do that.
-Sonos and Philips HUE support works. Only in beta. And only if you consider such (mis)behavior a ""work"".
-Bundled manual refers to the old version of the app. But who cares if it's useless anyway?

THE UGLY
-I've spent nearly 40 minutes trying to connect the hub to the app. I'm neither mentally limited nor twisted handed, but the whole process is so confusing that I'm not sure I'll be able to repeat it again.
-Good luck making the basic kit doing anything more useful than sending you an SMS when someone opens the door.

While this might have been a good introduction to home automation, SmartThings are in fact a useless trinket for a few geeks who might have fun solving all the puzzles within its clunky app.",2.0,0

"I am a long time Skechers shoe wearer for two reasons: 1. I have worn them for fifteen years and 2. I need a wide shoe, which Skechers has always had, which is why I have worn them for fifteen years.

The pilot is one of my go-to boots. I wear the hell out of them and buy a new pair every other year depending on what I put them through. I wear them for dress, for work, for hiking, for fishing. They hold up very well, always look good, and are always comfortable.

The biggest reason I wear them is that I can trust the size. I wear a 13 EE and over the years the fit has always been true. That's a huge relief since buying a good, wide, boot or show is a serious PITA.

The boots are not without their short comings but these are, relative to the price, minor things. The shoe-lace metalic tabs get lose eventually and bend and require a pair of pliers to bend back and keep in place. But, like I said, this is a minor thing.

And, like I said, I do beat up on these boots pretty bad. But the heel always wears well, never breaks or falls apart, the leather holds up great and the comfort stays until I buy a new pair.

I obviously cannot recommend them enough.",5.0,0

"OK, so Fisher-Price isn't the same as it was when YOU were a kid.
Newsflash!
Neither are today's kids.

I understand that people are sceptical of tie-ins with movies, but that at least is familiar to all of us. That has always been around.

I think the biggest complaint for the Imaginext line for me, which I DO have, myself, is the quality for the price. The plastic is not as high quality as it should be.

However, I disagree on a different point with a number of the other reviewers here.

I am talking about the ""boredom factor"" mentioned. It seems to plague many of the parents or reviewers.

I have one question. I do not mean to offend people, just to make them think.

Take a 6 year old, for example (not a 3 year old--this toy is recommended for 36 months to age 8!!!-- unless the 36 month old in question is a card carrying member of MENSA), and try opening this WITH him or her ... and playing with it TOGETHER!

It is kind of similar to learning to read a book, when you learn to play. You need guidance. Ages 4-6 (which I figure are the most appropriate for the Imaginext DC Super Friends Superman Playset) are still encompassing fairly young children.
Reading to a child in that age range makes books something which will then be loved far more than if a child just looks at books by him or her self.

It is the same thing with a toy like this. Don't expect a toy to be a babysitter.

Play with your child when you offer your child the toy.

There is lots to do with it! We like it very much.
I hope you understand that I am not dissing everyone who called it boring.
I am just providing a different perspective. Thanks for reading!
Mom of five sons here! :)

"Just to start, I love music and I have purchased the best of the best in headphones from Bose to Shure.
They fit nicely in the ear but do take the time to see which of the sises fit best of the 3 fittings they send you.
The sound is VERY heavy in bass and is great to listen to techno and house genres. They lack in treble and have good enough mids. Not the best for listening to jazz or blues as the lack of treble does make things a little muddy, but not TOO bad. The cord is long enough and does not feel like it will snap easily. They have a good build quality and do not seem like they will break in the near future.",4.0,0
"I love these headphones.  I used them every day on my commute to and from work - train, subway.  The noise cancelling is truly impressive.  When you put these on (powered off) they already block a lot of sound.  Switch them on (best in a noise environment - even a bathroom with the vent on or a car with the a/c on) and it's magical how everything grows very silent.  The sound is very good too - I loved my Sony MDR-V6 headphones for years and my initial impression was that the Bose was not quite as good.  Then after a couple weeks listening to the Bose I went to put on my Sony's and was dismayed to find that they no longer fit me well and the sound was no longer special.  These are much more comfortable and the ear cups are larger to fit my whole ear.  Back to the noise cancellation - it works like this:  you sit in a quiet car in the train station parking lot, and listen to music at a low volume.  The train arrives and you hop on.  The overall noise level is very high - the air system is very noisy, the sound of the train moving, conversations around.  However you don't have to adjust the volume of your music - it sounds just as good.  You take the headphone off your ear to compare, and grin like a loon at just how quiet they are!  I've stood next to a locomotive waiting for the train to open in the station, and using my phone sound pressure level app discovered that the noise is between 95 and 100 decibles - that's really loud.  With my headphones on i certainly heard the engine but again, didn't need to raise the volume of my music - it's that effective.",5.0,0

"To begin with, my grandsons, ages 4 and 6, had already been watching the show and really liked it, so they were more than delighted to get their own Chuggington to play with. The thing I like about this toy is its sturdiness.  If it's one thing I've learned about little boys it's that they are rough on toys, yet they get upset if something breaks.  I sympathize with the person who said the cars fall off the tracks, but my experience has been that unless you pay a lot of money and buy replicas of real trains and anchor the tracks down permanently somewhere, you will have that problem with any toy that runs on tracks.  Also, the set is chunky enough and easy enough to set up to not frustrate small children whose fine motor skills are not that well developed.  Therefore, the toy helps give children confidence that they can do something themselves.  And I think that any toy that lets children use their own imagination when they play is very good.  There are far too many toys out there that don't do that.  Everything is already imagined for the child.  Not only are these toys not helping children, they are downright boring to play with.  I don't believe that most people realize how important it is for children to develop their imaginations.  This is not something frivilous.  It is those who can imaginine new technology, new inventions, and new and better ways of living that bring progress to the world.",5.0,0

"This board is perfect for quick games as well as teaching beginners. The small & light portability is great for grabbing and bringing to a friend's house without lugging in a full-size board (which there's simply no way to do without it coming off like a big grand entrance).

The bottom is covered in felt which is *really* nice. Every other small board I've used it's been a real nuisance to not inadvertently knock the board a bit and mess up where the pieces are. The felt, which seems to be secured reasonably well, gives a perfect amount of grip while retaining a traditional feel.

Finish / grain is nice. It doesn't come off like an oak heirloom, but it doesn't come off like a cheap piece of contact paper either. I think that's precisely the charm of this board - it's a classy but not intimidating introduction - inexpensive but not cheap. Actually at this price I'd be happy to give it to anyone I can get hooked and buy another for myself (any go player in the US will tell you that a live partner is worth far more than the cost of this board!)

Another use for this board: if you are looking at games online (such as at itsyourturn) or studying go books to demystify some of the concepts having a little 9x9 around is great to play out a board position by yourself when you see a shape and are trying to read into which side it will favor, whether it's alive, etc.",5.0,0

I switched to them as I couldn't clean the plastic litter boxes completely of odor, and in my small home that's an important consideration.  To boot, I threw away a Litter Robot before settling on these boxes, if that gives a reference point for me using only these.  These are the BOMB - very strong, holds two bags of 18 lb Dr. Elsey's litter at a time (that's how my cats and I like it ;), and the cardboard sides allow the litter to stay drier.  Getting clumps off the walls is easier compared to plastic bins, likely due to the drying effect.  After a month, I bin the entire shebang (one box for two cats lasts an entire month).  I've also used the smaller ones when I travel with my cats.  The boxes are reasonably-priced, and I usually get them from my local Pet Club - but am extremely grateful I can find them for the same price on Amazon with Prime Shipping when my local Pet Club is out of stock.  I literally (""litter-ally""!) don't know if I could've survived having cats without these and the Litter Genie!  Next step - toilet-training the cats.",5.0,0

"I have always loved Melissa & Doug because of their outstanding quality and educational value. When shopping for my kids I seek out the brand because its one I know I can trust.

This year is Jaxs first Christmas so its an extra special one for us. Of course Im going to go to a name I trust! At this age of almost one, he doesnt show much preference for toys. He basically likes anything and everything because he wants to explore this great big world. This is that rare time that I can get him what I want because hes not going to tell me otherwise!

The Melissa & Doug sound puzzles are the perfect gift for little ones. They help their growth and development with motor skills, problem solving and general thinking. Oh yeah, and they are super fun! My older kids have always liked puzzles and Jax is no different! Even though this is for 2+, he immediately started trying to put it together. He doesnt quite have the logic and reasoning to get the fit right but he sure had fun trying and big sister Paige helped him! As with all their products, the quality is good and durable. Lots of puzzles are flimsy and don't last long but these are thick wooden pieces with little red tabs for easy removal.

When you lift up or put down the piece, it makes the animal sound. I love that I can also teach Jax what sounds animals make while we do this together.

The Melissa & Doug Sound Puzzles are the perfect gift for little ones. They will think of it as a toy but as moms we know, they are learning!",5.0,0

"I was excited to purchase these due to the pretty colors offered and the reviews posted. The first time I went to use them though, I regretted my decision. They are hard to attach and are impossible to put around a bra strap unless one is wearing a flimsy slip-type strap that is made for show rather than support. I will keep them but will now need to take the time and effort to sew on a different type of attaching device. These are clumsy at best and made for young teen-wear rather than a mature full figured-woman who needs these cover-ups. I suggest looking elsewhere unless you are attaching to very thin straps and have the time and dexterity to attach these clumsy made buttons. (They remind me of the old garter attachments that attached to hose..younger readers will be clueless about that comment) Also I am not certain about how the lace will hold up in the wash. They will probably need to be gently hand-washed as the lace is not the thicker quality I am use to.",2.0,0
"I picked these up on a half price sale a few weeks back.  While I generally don't like to purchase shoes online since each manufacturer tends to fit differently.  Since I have owned Rockport shoes before I gave it a shot.  The shoes are nice looking, comfortable and a good value.
I have been happy with the past Rockports that I have owned and expect no less from these.  The sole is a ridged design so it holds the ground and doesn't slip when walking as has happened with other rubber soled shoes I have owned.
Comfort is the word that is synonymous with the Rockport brand and these shoes are no exception.  They are nice to slip into and nicer to walk in.  The rubber sole has enough give to absorb some of the shock of walking but not enough to feel cheap or soft.
I have a wide foot and normally wear a 10.5.  I fit into an 11 in the Rockports so I suggest going up a half size.
Overall, I would highly recommend these shoes.",5.0,0

The picture quality is very impressive for such a little TV, although as other reviewers have mentioned, the audio quality is HORRIBLE.  If you intend to watch this TV often, I would suggest investing in a nice inexpensive pair of computer speakers....but this may not be necessary for casual viewing of news or weather channels.

"FINALLY, I found a cat litter that's worth it's weight.  I live in a very small space, have one cat but *hate* kitty litter peppered all over my floors. I also dislike coming into my cozy little living space to smell cat litter dust or worse...cat waste.  This litter is finally the one I will stick with, after changing litter brands with every bag for almost a year.  This litter tracks significantly less and smells significantly less than any clay or recycled litter I've used.  I still have to tidy up the floor mat outside of her box after a couple days but it actually stays on the cheap small mat! I was worried I was going to have to buy a $40 special mat to catch the litter she throws out of the box like confetti.

It also doesn't smell. At all.  I have a sensitive sense of smell and I can't smell it when I walk in the condo, even though the box is 10 ft from the door.  I used all 5 lbs. in the box at once to help encourage her to cover her waste (laziest cat ever) and it's keeping the odor down very well.  I don't attempt to scoop the urine out but I do scoop the poo about every 2-3 days.  I've had the same litter in the box for 2 weeks now and no smell and the cat hasn't protested!  There is still plenty of dry litter for covering in there still as well - quick absorption.

I give this product 5 stars, despite it's higher cost, because it's not stuck to the bottom of my feet and it doesn't smell like litter or cat pee in my house.  Is that too much to ask from other litter companies?! I think not.",5.0,0
"I had this trasmitter for 2 years. It outperformed my firends and families transmitters by being compact, no cords unless you want to charge it. The transmitting wire is on the outside which gives it a stronger signal even though it runs off the Ipods power. The only drawback is that....it runs off the Ipods power and drains it after a good day of driving, unless you plug it in to a mini USB port cigarette lighter power thingy which you can grab at radio shack. I had to buy another one because I pulled the wire out of it not realizing it was the transmitter cable......not my brightest moment. But just press play and within 4-5 feet of my radio I had crystal clear music with NO STATIC. I could pass it around my car without interruption and people could play what they liked.

"5-11-2013  Silver Marcasite Rose Ring
I searched and searched the Amazon.com for the perfect Rose Ring for me:  The Poet.  This definitely turned out to be the perfect Rose Ring for me.  I purchased it for $45.99.  I was a little afraid when I ordered this that the rose would sit up too high.  But is does not.  It is a very enjoyable ring to wear.  I purchased it in a 7  thinking that I would wear it on my middle finger.  But it ended up fitting my left index finger perfect and I love wearing it on that hand.  Here is my meditation for this ring:

The Poet's Silver Rose Ring of Marcasite
Oh, there are some tales of those days of old
During the rush west in search for gold.
There was a rebellion
Led by Nevada women
To wear not gold but marcasite:
Beauty in what was of plenty seemed right.
The Poet wears a silver rose ring of marcasite;
Supporting this Nevada cause so right!

"We bought this thinking it was a good price but really for the same amount, you could buy materials for many more bracelets. This one only  lets you make the 5 or 6 that you see.

We bought this for a 9.5 year old. She couldn't really understand the directions. I read them and once I got the knack of it tried to teach her, but she couldn't do it. In the end I had to make them myself and give the bracelet to the original gift recipient. Thus my thinking that it would have been cheaper to buy the materials and make the bracelets the gift.

I will say, we didn't know the girl well ahead of time, so we weren't sure of her crafting level. At 10, friendship bracelets were all the rage in my school, and all the girls were making them on the playground or between breaks. But not every kid is adept or interested.

"We have had this for a year which is a pretty good length of time for a bath toy in our house. My boys got this as a gift from a friend for Christmas in 2014. It came without the suction cups to attach it, but I have  a textured tub so it  probably wouldn't have worked anyway. One of my sons has played with this pretty frequently, just sitting it on the ledge of the tub. He mostly pretended, because for it to work it has to be partially in the water. The floating gup that came with this was total crap and grew mold inside it, so I had to throw it out in the first month. The roller ripped in the first week, so out it went too. The rest of the unit has stayed functional, so we kept it. I am careful to squeeze the water out of it until no water squirts out after each bath use. But finally last week,  I noticed the blue tubing looked funny. I cut it open and it was growing black mold inside it. So I cut off the tubing and had to pry the plastic shower head off to get it all off. I then told my kid he could play with the housing like that since now water won't collect in it to grow mold. It is a fun toy, but designed very poorly for emptying. It will grow mold, no matter what you do..... it's just a matter of time.",2.0,0

"My kitty got a Urinary Tract Infection, and I was really, really worried this could be an ongoing issue, so I purchased this supplement to add to my existing dietary supplement routine. When I put the full amount (1/4 teaspoon) in her food, she turned her little nose up at it and refused to touch it. She was supposed to get the full dose twice a day for two to three weeks before going down to a maintenance dose of 1/4 teaspoon once or twice a week. So, I did the math, and the next day put 1/16 teaspoon (a pinch) in her food, and after a couple of suspicious sniffs, she ate her food without complaint. This equals out to two full doses (1/2 of a teaspoon) every eight days, which is right around the maintenance level. She (and her two brothers) have managed to eat this without issue for several weeks now. She's had a few issues, where I thought perhaps the UTI was recurring, but they were only minor blips, and otherwise, she's been just fine, so I'm very pleased.

"As a recent new cat person, I purchased this for my cat to have a place to scratch, perch, and play. My cat was immediately interested in this condo, even as I was putting it together. Assembly wasn't too hard, I just followed what another reviewer had suggested and used a picture for reference. It should be noted that this unit is kind of HUGE. It is very tall! While the size works just fine for where I have it located, make sure to check the dimensions of your space before purchasing.

A few months after adopting my first cat, I adopted a second one. Both cats, each around 8 pounds, love to jump from the different perches. Though all the screws are tightened (something I check monthly as they tend to loosen over time), the whole thing does shake when they are running around on it. This does not seem to bother the cats, and therefore does not bother me. This unit has lived on hardwood floors and carpeting, neither flooring seems to aid or reduce in the amount of shaking. My cats do not spend much time in either cubby space, they mostly make use of the perches. While I love the blue color of this unit, it does highlight the amount of cat hair left behind. I vacuum the condo about once every 1-2 weeks.

I have had this unit for about 9 months and it has suffered a bit of damage. The highest perch is the most popular, and thus has suffered some minor shredding/tearing of the blue carpeting. The top hanging mouse has not survived, but the lower one is still hanging on. Finally, the base of the unit suffered some damage from my robot vacuum. I now block off the condo so that he cannot climb up it anymore (obviously not the cat trees fault).

Overall I think this is a great cat condo, and every time I see my cats playing on it, I feel happy.",5.0,0
"I have 6 female rats whom enjoy this toy. I have a double critter nation cage and this clipped on the underside of one of the shelves perfectly. Immediately they went straight to work tearing down the two sections of handing wood blocks and balls that is secured via some sort of leather strap  - which I anticipated. The wooden blocks and balls are great chew toys to be strewn about and therefore remain useful. What is wonderful is the main strip of wood blocks is secured via metal chain or whatnot that they can not destroy so my six rats have this awesome, huge, hanging chew block set which they happily use.

Alas, I don't have one of the Eye-Fi aware models that recognizes Eye-Fi in use, but I don't care.

Let me start out by stating I bought this as a gift for my brother. It gets points for the outside appearance and the fact that it has actual glass and not cheap plastic. The latch is okay. It does the job but could be improved in quality.  On the inside the is where it appears cheap to me and how you hve to set up the dividers.  I think they were aiming for you to be able to customize the set up but it comes off cheap to me. The dividers feel like the re little more than felt covered cardboard. Maybe I didn't read the discription fully I will have to recheck but I thought the diveiders were built in and that is why I was most disappointed.  I do like the fact that the cushions are removable because that mens you can store more than just watches in this case. It works well for almost any men's jewelry. I went ahead and gave three stars because if it wasn't for the dividers I would have been pleased with the purchase and maybe a better latch.  Needs to be better priced for what it is though.

"The usual problem with reviewing cat toys is what to say when kitty doesn't like / use the toy. It's hard to evaluate a product made for cats as a human, so normally if I get a toy and Ms Cat does not like it, I say no harm, no foul and usually opine that someone else's cat may like the toy / furniture.

Not the case here. The entire premise of this toy is flawed, and I really don't think many cat owners or their pets will have much use for it.

First, the cat shown in the picture lounging on the arch of the X must have been a) very much smaller than normal cats and b) carefully trained. My own quadruped is very average sized and she could not at all lounge on this thing without drooping more than a third of her body off of it. Most cats will not willingly assume such a position, so don't think of this as furniture.

As a scratching post (and also as a theoretical lounging platform) this is also flawed, as it is very light weight and cheaply made. Cats will not use scratching posts that move around as they try to dig in, and this design is too light weight to offer the stability that a cat seeking to scratch is looking for.

My cat tried this once as a scratching post, after I poured catnip over it, and after it slid across the floor as she tried to stretch out, she turned her nose up at it and has not returned to it since.

Folks, if you want a scratching post, make sure it is solid and heavy. It will cost more than this does. If you want cat furniture, make sure it is solid and large enough to accommodate your cat. The designers of this product ignored these axioms and used a trained miniature cat to make it look more useful than it is.

Two stars, because your cat might like it as a scratching post if you can wedge it somewhere where it can't move around too easily.",2.0,0

They both have features I like and also things I think could be improved, but they don't shut themselves off every time the cat stops it like some do (a good thing!), and its very quiet except for an enticing little sound it makes sometimes, kind of like a squirrel chirping only not that loud. I wish they had a timer, and this second model would be nicer if it had a remote, because you have to push the button four times to go through all options when turning on or off. My cats tend to do a lot of watching and some active playing with them. At least it keeps them occupied some of the time!",5.0,0

"I really like this kitchen. I like the clean minimalist design, that it's wooden, and that it's smaller yet still has room for 2 toddlers to play.

What I didn't like about this product is that one of th sides didn't come with the correct predrilled holes, and after contacting Amazon and Hape, I could not get a replacement part. They did offer several other ""solutions"" but bottom line is, the top of my kitchen still isn't properly secured on one sid because the holes weren't secured properly and I could not get a replacement part.

"I've never spent more than $100 on a pair of headphones before, so I can't really compare these to other high end cans, but I absolutely love the accurate, high quality sound reproduction of these headphones! Materials quality and style are superb as well. After reading many reviews, I decided these would offer the best sound quality within my budget of less than $200, and I'm very happy with my purchase! Like other reviewers said, these offer very accurate sound reproduction. They have plenty of tight, punchy bass when it's recorded in the music, but it's not overpowering. If you're looking for exaggerated, skull-rattling bass, these probably aren't the phones for you.

"This dollhouse is a complete pain to put together alone. It would have been a much easier job with 2. Think awkward two finger screwdriver holding while suspending a floor with the same hand and using a tiny allen wrench with the other hand. I only had one hole that had poor pre-drilling, so compared to some of the other reviewers, I felt lucky. After the 2 1/2 hour construction, it seems like it will be a nice dollhouse. It seems good and sturdy. The ramp for the garage will likely fall off regularly because of the way it attaches, but its not really a essential element anyway.

Update
3 months later... I am leaving the three star rating.  The garage door ramp has never fallen off like I expected that it would, it doesn't attach very strongly, but the house doesn't get moved around all that much either. My son loves this house, and its played with daily. No amount of adjustments ever made our elevator work smoothly. It got stuck all the time, and I removed it entirely. It was bulky, awkward, and impossible for my independent 2 1/2 year to operate on his own. Luckily we have a super handy grandpa, who whipped up some nice ladders with some scrap wood and dowels, and my son has been much happier. Removing the elevator made the lower floor and garage much more accessible as well.",3.0,0

"I purchased 5 of these drives to build an 8TB RAID5 array (onboard RAID on the motherboard). They were 2010 vintage drives so the first thing I did was update the firmware on them.

I notified Amazon and they sent out a replacement drive right away. One thing about RAID5 arrays...making changes takes forever. It took a 2 days to initialize my array and 4 days to rebuild it after replacing the failed drive. A week later the RAID management software came up with an error indicating that the replacement drive could not be found. Turns out the SATA connector had come loose. I immediately ordered new SATA cables with the metal clips on the end that lock the connector in place. Overall I'm very happy with these drives.

I am no professional. I had used a basic DSLR prior to this the k2000. So this review is based on someone upgrading from a beginner SLR to a more sophisticated one.

Pros:

Low light: This is a camera that takes great low light pictures, you can push the ISO up pretty high and still get great pictures. This was the biggest reason for me to upgrade. I had a hard time taking pictures of my kids in various performances with terrible lighting conditions. Obviously one needs a good lens. But with my old camera I had to throw too many away. This camera combined with the DA 50-135mm lens is one terrific package for such situations.

Weight/Size: this is the most compact camera at such a level that you will find.

Weather resistant: This is a weather resistant camera! Combine this with a weather resistant lens and you are all set.

Electronic Level: I thought this was a gimmick but after using it for a few days, I find it indispensable to take level photos.

User Selectable Focus points: these are standard in expensive cameras, nothing special if you have used such cameras before but for somone upgrading I quickly found out how convenient this was.

Shake reduction: Pentax unlike Nikon/Canon has shake reduction built into the camera, so any lens you put on it has shake reduction function.

Lenses: Pentax has small pancake lenses called limited lenses. Try these if you are new to Pentax. They are superb and great to walk around with without looking like a dork.

Cons: Expensive...",5.0,0

"This is a really menacing figure, as befits the guard dog of the underworld of Hades. It's a sturdy figure, but may not be that suitable for smaller children due to the rough edges and fairly sharp detail on the figure.

What I got it for was for use in roleplaying games. The figures for those games, of which D&D is a great example, are usually of the 25/28mm or 1/72 scale. In that scale, this figure is huge, the size of a bus. For some reason, that's how I've always pictured Cerberus, so it works for me. If you're looking for something more the size of a large dog, then this won't be for you. Otherwise, it will surely have players breaking into a nervous sweat when it's brought to the gaming table.

The sculpt is dynamic and properly fierce looking, and it stands well on its own. The paint scheme is simple but very well-done. Overall, a very good figure for those interested in Greek mythology.",5.0,0
"A quick explanation of the title. I have severe to profound loss of hearing in the mid to high frequency range and my Sharp LC60LE835U become just about unintelligible with its poor speakers (wonderful picture). Was looking to go CC but, after reading the reports of soundbars, decided to try one last thing. Had a 5:1 Bose system whose speaker system couldn't easily be connected after moving into a new home. It came down to the Sony CT-150 and the Yamaha ATS 1010 (from Costco). The decision was made after reading that I could use my powered sub-woofer with the Yamaha, plus its great glossy black looks matched the TV, blueray (& Cisco VCR .. to some extent).
Real simple optical connection from TV, and wow! ... I could now hear with clarity, from movies to TV series. I replayed a couple of TV shows & movies that I had previously had real difficult time in understanding, and now had a whole different audio experience. A boon for baby boomers for sure.
Now for the short list of cons, not deal breakers but folks should be aware of them. The built-in sub-woofer is simply not up to the job - get an external unit to really appreciate the bass (especially in movies).  The surround sound is not wondrous, and to advertise it as a 7:1 experience is just plain deceptive. Yamaha should get real with its claims about this aspect. However, I would imagine this unit is just about there with others in this class and no-one in their right minds can really expect a decent surround sound from a soundbar.
To conclude, the Yamaha far exceeded my expectations in uplifting my TV experience - if you have similar hearing loss, just give this a try.",4.0,0

"This is a very nice looking shoe if it fits correctly.  I have a normal sized ankle and calf.  The top strap is wide but flattering and also a tinge on the shorter side.  I am wearing on the last hole so that it is not tight and uncomfortable.  I will most likely go down a notch once a little stretched to my foot.  The heel is the biggest consideration.  While I can wear them the whole day they are not totally comfortable the whole whole day.  The ball of my foot does feel some pressure as there is not a lot of padding or cushion. The heel is on the higher side of a wedge but again looks very attractive.  The material of the shoe is a suede like fabric and flexible, not stiff.

"Wow. I bought this because my 3 year old granddaughter picked it out in a promotional magazine. She loves to shop and then expects grandma to buy... So I bought it because it's not that expensive and gave it to her as a gift. She was thrilled!

But what thrilled me is that her mom leaves it out in the living room because the little one plays with it CONSTANTLY! I can't believe it but, 6 months later, she still loves it and plays with it as much as when it was new. Everyone gets a daily cone. Visitors must order what they want. And she still plays with it on her own.

Plus, we all pay with the cash. She tells us how much we owe - $1 for each scoop plus $1 for a topping. She figures the cost on her own and knows when she's been given the correct amount.

This gift turned out to be a way better purchase than I ever expected it to be.",5.0,0

"This is a good quality container and it looks good enough to have ""in the open"" in my kitchen.  The large container is very spacious, I typically buy 13-18 pound bags of food and they fit very nicely (I leave the food in the bag).  The casters are fantastic - being able to wheel this around makes it so easy to clean and keeps the container off the ground.  There are two things keeping me from giving it 5 stars, (1) the scoop is way too big and awkward and (2) the small container is always in the way when stored on top of the big container.  I have bought two of these; I use one big one for ""long term"" storage and keep the two small containers on top.  The other big one I use to hold the food my dog eats on a daily basis.

My bun tends to ignore his toys for a while (as in a few weeks) before deciding to play with them, and may even decide to ignore them again.

The Acer Aspire I bought has 2gb ram and overall is quite fast enough for my uses and with all my Microsoft Office products.  The wireless works very good and I love the unit. I am an usually an Apple guy and really wanted a Mac Air but being that I had to buy an out drive to load software and watch DVDs plus tax I was looking at $1300 +/- a few dollars.  I decided that since I only really use this for traveling this would be a better deal and that it was.  The big negative on this unit however is the touch pad which is terrible and almost unusable to me and I have to use a mouse to really do anything or else you go crazy wasting time trying to point and click to the areas you want.  The pad just is not sensitive enough even after I adjusted as much as possible.  With the mouse it works great and it's really no big deal at least in the way I use it but if I had to continually use this with just the pad I would dump it for something else in a minute.

"These are nice clippers. I'm not a professional, but shave my dog down regularly, and have tried  a number of different products. These clippers are fine, and they work nicely. What I'm not so sure about is the price. I'd suggest two other options:

For professional use, the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Oster-A5-Turbo-2-Speed-Professional-Animal-Clipper/dp/B000LRN31A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Oster A5 Turbo 2-Speed Professional Animal Clipper</a>&nbsp;has been the gold standard for grooming professionals for decades. And since it sells for less than these, I'd select that first for professional usage.

For home use, I don't really notice any difference between this one and my&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Andis-EasyClip-Pro-Animal-7-Piece-Detachable-Blade-Clipper-Kit-Pet-Grooming-MBG-2-22690/dp/B00UT3F31O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Andis EasyClip Pro-Animal 7-Piece Detachable Blade Clipper Kit, Pet Grooming, MBG-2 (22690)</a>. It works exactly the same, and also feels like a high quality clipper (way better than the cheap Wahl human/home clippers I have). It's not the highest-end Andis clipper (they have ones that cost more which are designed for professional settings), bit it feels and works every bit as good as this one for me. It's only one speed, but I don't see the need for two speeds for most uses anyway. That Andis clipper is about half the price of this one, and includes a case, and four-piece comb set (#1-4). If you want to use combs with this one, you'll pay more for something like the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wahl-Professional-Animal-Stainless-Steel-Guide-Combs-3390-100/dp/B002RBWL1G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wahl Professional Animal Stainless Steel Guide Combs #3390-100</a>, which I'm sure is nice... but it's not included.

Also, note that there are two difference blade sizes for Wahl clippers. The ones designed for animal usage have longer combs which do not fit the cheaper (and not awesome) home Wahl clippers that many people may have. The animal ones are interchangeable with Andis (I used my Andis combs on this one for testing).

"I'm not sure if I'd really call this ""high gain"", but thanks to its antenna and USB extension cord, it does a better job of pulling in wi-fi signals than your typical ""nano"" or compact USB wi-fi adapter. The box contains the adapter, which looks like an oversize USB flash drive; screw-on antenna, a USB extension cord that's maybe 2 feet long, and a mini CD containing the drivers.

One minuscule quibble: Like most USB wi-fi adapters, this one comes with a cap intended to protect the USB plug when the adapter is not in use. And, like most USB wi-fi adapters, it has no means for stowing or otherwise retaining that cap when the adapter IS in use. My guess is that most people eventually lose the cap. This is of no real consequence except, perhaps, aesthetics.

The best improvement in wi-fi performance is achieved by using the provided extension cord to position the adapter above and away from your computer, where it can get the best possible signal. Of course, there's no reason why you couldn't buy your own USB extension cord and use that to improve the signal with a more conventional USB wi-fi adapter. But the antenna, which actually contains metal parts configured in a way that really does boost the gain, still gives the TL-WN722N an edge over a nano adapter with an extension cord.

As with most USB wi-fi adapters, this one comes with unneeded wi-fi management software. (Most wi-fi management software has been superfluous since Windows XP Service Pack 3 gave Windows robust, built-in wi-fi management.) Unlike with some other adapters, there is no way to install just the drivers you need while omitting the management software that you don't need. But after it's installed, you can set Windows as the wi-fi manager.",4.0,0

"I just received this item today. At first glance, it looks attractive enough. Upon closer inspection, it is a poorly made item. The manufacturers should have put more thought in quality rather than adding two decorative silver bones which adds no function to this item. The stitching is unraveling at the ""leash area."" The ""tag"" stitching also has unraveled. If I were the cynical type, I would say that the supplier knew of the unraveled stitching and tried to glue it back together but it didn't hold. Also the hidden tag is paper under a plastic sleeve. I would never trust my beloved dog to only have this as a tag. It is not waterproof nor is it secure in it's sleeve; The tag is useless. The ""D"" is too bulky, and as others have mention, the extra collar end just hangs there, making the collar look unfinished and shabby. The built-in leash is a great idea, but this item falls short in quality. The leash is made of some stretching rubber (kind of like a car fan belt but not as strong). I predict that this leash will break if used too often, so I am not going to rely on it in public. I'll just use it in the house. I normally would return a product like this but it probably would cost me more in time and money to ship it back, which is probably what the supplier counts on.

"This has to be one of the best designed and most comfortable bras I have ever worn! As a size 36DD woman, it is very hard to find something that not only has good support, but is feminine and pretty too. This bra designer understands the needs of a heavily busted woman. First of all, they give you an extra hook and eye bra strap extender to allow your bra to fit perfectly throughout a little weight gain or weight loss. No back fat is going to be created by this band not fitting well. The straps are softly padded over the shoulders, so nothing digs in leaving those red strap marks on your shoulders at the end of the day. The underwire supported cups of the bra give full coverage and also great support holding everything at the right height and in place. They are lightly lined for comfort and concealment and the lace and bow accents are very feminine. Nothing shows through your clothing ~ even the lace overlay on the cups. I believe for me this was a perfect fit - it did not run too large or too small.

The sculpt is so good that even the tips of the armor that point out have sharp feel to them. Even his Arcle (the transformation belt) has ridiculously awesome detail for something so small.

He does have accessories: interchangeable hands (default closed fists, open relaxed hands, a thumbs up hand and a transformation related hand) and an alternate head that depicts his ""dark form."" One thing that people won't expect from this line of figures is the scale. Compared to SH Figuarts, these are almost half the size. Those used to the SH Figuarts scale may have a hard time adjusting, but it's really not that bad. Matter of fact, despite the size that this line (S.I.C.) uses, all their figures have amazing detail.

"I bought this unit a couple years ago, and it is great. I use it often (mostly streaming or playing off my phone or laptop). When plugged in to the AC adapter, it is plenty loud. I use it to play songs I practice my bass to, and it's loud enough to keep up with a Hartke stack. I've never tried to play a guitar through it, but I'm sure it would be fine if you don't get carried away. When it's running on battery power, it does get significantly quieter, but still decently loud. While heavy, the carry strap does make it easy to carry around with you. All in all, I'm not sure what all the bad reviews are about. The only thing I agree with, is the radio kinda sucks. No external antenna, so if the signal is weak it will be skipped over. There is also no fine tuning to the radio. If the station isn't strong, it will be skipped over. I rarely listen to radio, so it's not a big deal for me though.",5.0,0

The band across the instep isn't sufficient to keep the shoe on when you've got a lot of water force.  I'd say to size down if you're between sizes.  In summary:  great for the beach and the walk to the beach but pick something else for climbing falls or other more active use.",3.0,0

"We had this gun for more than a month now. We purchased NERF guns in the past and the automatic feature sounds very appealing and fun. Right out of the box (after inserting new C-batteries which were purchased separately), the first time the new darts were placed in the transparent clip, one of the darts clogged the gun. There are times when my son can shoot the entire contents of the clip (18 elite darts - we ended up buying additional elite darts from Amazon - I believe this is a good deal:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nerf-N-Strike-Elite-Dart-Refill-Pack-30-Darts/dp/B0083TXZVQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nerf N-Strike Elite Dart Refill Pack (30 Darts)</a>), and other times when the gun gets clogged. It became a habit to watch my son excited to use this gun, only to have it get clogged, and get him upset. I would say the major fault with this gun is clogging: about 30-40% of the time. That's way too much, and I believe the reason for it is the design of the flexible darts. In addition, I would say the use of C batteries may not be the most inspired option. You have to unscrew the battery holder, and I believe that the batteries can drain unnecessary fast, since there is no shut-off button. Otherwise I do not know how to explain why we had to replace batteries 2 weeks after relatively limited playtime.

I was undecided to give this product 3 or 4 stars. I settled on 4 since the gun itself is great fun when it works. I find the issue to be with the flexibility of the darts. Once they get bent, the chances for clogging increases, and even new darts can get stuck and stop the fun.",4.0,0

"I purchased this (Displayport model) to add a 27 inch 2560 x 1440 Asus monitor to my 3-year-old HP dv7 / Win7 laptop. I am quite satisfied with the performance, although there a few (quite minor) wrinkles which may be specific to my setup and may not affect anyone else. They are as follows:

There may be HDCP protection issues that I have not figured out yet. (Yesterday when trying to watch a video on Amazon Prime, the message ""will not be displayed in HD due to HDCP issues, continuing in SD"" or something like that. (A Blu-ray disc, however, plays just fine.) My computer normally runs at less than 20% CPU usage, but trying to play a particular video on Hulu the other day sent the CPU up to 62%. No other video source has caused that problem. And it was only one time.
And I have the feeling the computer runs a bit hotter than before, causing the fan to be on more.
The computer has stopped responding a couple times, requiring a hard shutdown, followed by the message ""AMD Graphics driver has stopped responding and has recovered."" I leave that to you to interpret.

Again, these issues may be specific to my computer setup.

I had to update by USB controller driver, but a link at the Ableconn site made it quite easy.

Follow-up: All issues have been resolved: I updated the AMD driver for my Radeon graphics chip (their web site made it easy to do so) and I no longer get any freezeups; there is no problem playing HDCP streaming media, and using Internet Explorer / Silverlight for streaming playback uses only a nominal amount of CPU (it is the Displayport software that uses the CPU, I think).",5.0,0

 As far as sound goes the highs will make your ears bleed, mids are very nice, vocals and live music sound nice. I'd say if you like to hear quality in your music these will do that but if you like hard rock,rap or anything with needed bass response look elsewhere.

"Within 17 months of purchase, my Toshiba Regza (a $1,500 television set) is unusable.  About 1/3 of the screen is covered with multicolored vertical lines.  The authorized repair center wants $2,000 in total to fix the TV set (it requires an $1,800 part). Toshiba customer service tells me I am out of luck because the product is out of warranty.  They were not particularly nice, helpful, understanding, or at all interested in learning more about what is an obvious design defect in an allegedly high-end product.  It is  within Toshiba's discretion to service out of warranty products which have such profound failures within such a short period of time.

"This is a cute idea, but it's not all that much fun.
After the novelty wears off, there's not much to it.
This is a miniature race track with these cars that you charge up, then let zoom around for a few laps.  It's kind of neat.  These teeny tiny cars - seriously there are as big as my thumbnail, have batteries and motors in them.  The set needs two double-A batteries to work; and you ""charge"" up the little car, then let it go flying around the track.  It's a little klunky, but kind of neat.
Once the track is set, you place the car in the charging area and press a lever.  The lever sticks these two prongs into the back of the car.  The back of the car has 2 little metal pieces where the contact is made to charge the car.  Mine didn't work.  I had to fiddle with the wires in the back of the car but finally I was able to make contact.  When the car charges, it makes a little revving noise which is kind of neat.  Then you release the car, and it zooms around the track a few times.  It's cute.  It's also boring.  The novelty of one car wears off quickly.  This set claims you can race other cars, etc, but you only get one with this set.  Plus, it's not like you can make a bigger or different set with this one.  It's pretty limited in how you design or create a track.  If it came with two cars, you could ""race"" them etc, but alone, it's pretty dry stuff.
My nephews like to tear stuff up and re-design their own tracks but this is what it is - a single track.  At least it doesn't take up much space.",3.0,0

"Should have watched the video posted with the still pics for this toy.  In the pics, especially where the boy is kneeling, there is no background.  Because of this you can't tell that the toy MUST be attached to a wall to work.  See those yellow brackets (one is mid-circle on the right)?  The set comes with sticky pads that go on the backs of these yellow brackets, to attach them to the wall.  My son doesn't have enough open wall space in his room to use this.  Had to send it back.  But, I'm GLAD there was not enough wall space.  After watching the videos, the power boost, or whatever it's called, just makes the car go around and around.  NO interaction by the kids playing!  They just sit there and watch.  Check out one reviewers video for a quick experience of this toy.  The car goes around so fast you can't even see it!  Not the kind of Hot Wheel experience I want for my son.  Also, one reviewer said it was difficult to set up.  Not sure you'd WANT to break it down due when the child is done playing with it due to the difficulty factor AND due to the fact that it's stuck to the wall.

"I did not expect much from this (having ordered from Patty Boutique before via eBay - it was hit or miss, and delivery always took forever). I only ordered because I'd get it within 2 days under Prime and could return it if anything went wrong.
The dress does not look like much when taken out of the plastic bag - the Navy Blue seems somewhat dull, and the fabric is soft cotton jersey, somewhat thin.
But boy, does it transform when put on! The pattern is really flattering and is really smart - though made in China, it is made for larger-boned European women and is very flattering. Here's what worked on my 5.4, 165-lb, slightly pregnant (and suddenly size 12 instead of 8) frame:
- Shoulders fit just right - nothing cuts into armpits, nothing falls off - sleeves start where they are supposed to start
- Sleeves themselves are of decent length - not too short, they run to mid-palm and can be pulled up slightly
- Neck line is beautiful - it drapes nicely on the chest, and would work for small or big-busted
- Length is great - hits right below the knee (and will probably hike up just a bit as belly grows)
- Ruched pattern in the front and in the back creates slim silhouette and has plenty of fabric to expand as pregnancy progresses
- Unless it fades or shrinks in laundry, I see myself wearing this dress when not pregnant - it would look nice on a curvy figure.

I think I will get it in a couple other colors, as it seems to be able to take me through summer and upcoming Fall.
If I accessorize right (tights or no tights, necklaces or shawls, shoes or boots) - it would work for the office and for going out.",5.0,0

"Kid really likes these Smart Toys games - travel and full size.

Pros:
1) A travel game with fairly strong magnets
2) A cute penguin theme

Cons:
1) There is no place to store the unused magnets while the child is trying to figure out a solution - they just fall all over the car floor or lap. What might fix this is to have both sides be magnetic: one side - game board, one side - staging area. And put the game options on harder cardboard that flip out the top and bottom.

2) The solutions. I wish they were somehow hidden or in another section. I've worked with my kid on ""it's not as much fun if you don't figure it out on your own"" but once he figured out that the solutions were in the back - he just spent his time copying the solutions. I don't even know how to address this one - I gave him to toy to entertain him while we were setting up and breaking down camp and for the car, in lieu of a screen, so I couldn't sit there and play with him.",4.0,0

So when I first got it I took it out of the package and checked it all over for how well it was made and to my surprise it was made very well. The stitching is nice and tight. I pulled on different body parts and they are not coming off this dog. Very safe for littles ones. Skye is adorable and has a velcro strap underneath so Skye can go from a stuffed animal to a pillow in a snap! Skye's colors are very vivid and attractive to little ones. Sky is very soft and plushy and super comfortable to lay your head on. After reviewing Skye, I gave her to my granddaughter who sleeps with her every single night. She hasn't let her go since she got it!! Overall I'm impressed with the quality overall with this stuffed animal/pillow pet.

"A solid watch for the sub-$20 category, I was a little disappointed because I bought it because I thought it looked sleek/cool but when the watch got here and I took a closer look, I realized it was much more plastic-y than it looks in the picture.  Most of the knobs and buttons on the side are just decorative and aren't really buttons or controls.  There are only 4 buttons on the watch that are functional.

That being said, this watch probably does everything you expect from a watch of this price/category.  It is waterproof, has 4 different modes, including regular,alarm, stop watch, and secondary watch(displays a second set of time).  There is also a weird calendar mode, but the watch essentially tells you the date and day of the week as well.

Overall this is a great watch for the price, although it looks a little bit cheap, it really just looks like it's a sub-$20 watch, which it is.

"For today's standards, this is a nice, functional VCR that I would recommend to anybody who needs one.  But if you are looking for a comparable replacement for your 80s or 90s VCR, you will most likely be disappointed.

This LED display, for one thing, is lacking.  While VCRs used to show the tape counter while a tape is being played, rewinded, or fastforwarded, this VCR only displays the words ""PLAY"" or ""STOP"" or ""REW"", etc.  There is a very noticible delay when rewinding or fastforwarding, which can get very annoying at times.  The VCR also does not have any useful gimmicks, like Sony's Commercial Skip, that seperate it from any other brand or model.

My advice is this:  If you 1) already have a seperate DVD player for the same TV or 2) you do not plan to watch DVDs in the near future, then I would definitely buy this VCR model.  If not, then you should definitely look into buying a VCR/DVD combo, which in general do not have the problems mentioned above.  You can find an excellent one for just $100-150.",3.0,0

"For YEARS I held onto my old kodak EasyShare, it was one of the first ever produced! I loved my old one, but wanted something a bit more updated to take on my vacation abroad this summer. This camera's features are terrific: the LCD screen is large and easy to see, the functions are very user-friendly, the fact that is uses batteries is a huge plus while traveling, and it's size is small enough so that it doesn't take up too much room, but you'll never loose it in your purse and be able to have it readily on hand for those special (but sometimes fleeting) shots. The quality of the shots is not the best, but a little touch up using some photo editing software can certainly clear that up (the software that comes with the camera is convenient and easy to use, but it will not produce professional quality pictures like a bit of work with photoshop can). Overall I am very happy with my upgrade. My next camera will DEFINITELY be a kodak, but perhaps I'll wait a while and save my money to invest in one of their higher end cameras :)",4.0,0

"I really like this alarm clock so far.  It works very well with the iPhone and I've only had a few small issues with it.  Occasionally when you put the iPhone in the cradle it will only start charging the phone, but it won't play the audio.  I've only had this happen maybe twice since I bought it 2 months ago.  I think it's something to do with if you're playing a song already when you plug the phone into the dock.

It looks great, and I really like how the dock slides back into the clock for when you're not using it.  The dimmer is nice, but I wish it would maybe go one shade darker.  The audio quality is superb considering the size.

Overall, I'm very happy with the money I spent on this unit compared to the other ones available on Amazon.",5.0,0
"Dozen Doubloons is a pirate-themed card game for 1-4 players. As the name suggests, there are doubloons involved, and the number 12 is important. The first player to collect a dozen doubloons is the winner.

This game is attractively packaged and easy to play. To collect a doubloon, players must create the number twelve using cards in their hand or available cards on the table. Wild cards and 12 cards can give players an easy doubloon, and block cards can be used to hinder an opponent.

Dozen Doubloons has quickly become a new favorite among my children. I think one of the bigger draws for them is being able to collect the doubloons, but I know they also enjoy how easy the game is to understand while still challenging them to think and make decisions. Its not always easy to find a game that both of my children enjoy, so this game is definitely appreciated in our house.

As a light game to pass 10-15 minutes, I think Dozen Doubloons is a decent choice. It has a quick set-up and is easy to play. The game leans more on luck than strategy but still offers players various choices to make on their turn. Rules for playing a solitaire variation are also included on the rules sheet, and that is a fun choice for someone who has a few minutes alone and wants something to do.

As a parent, I also have to appreciate the educational value of this game. Being that my children are 5 and 7, they are both working on their addition facts, and the task of figuring out which cards can be used to add up to 12 has been of benefit to them both.

I received a free copy of this game in exchange for my honest review.",5.0,0

"I work in the wedding industry and have to work long days, on my feet, outside in the heat, and have to look professional. I've spent a ridiculous amount of money on high end dress shoes like Merrels and just have not been able to find a pair that are comfortable to wear all day. Both for my feet and my back. Enter the Sanuk yoga sling!!! These shoes are amazingly comfortable. Though, I will admit it took a few wears to get used to the feel of the yoga matte bottom. At first, it felt a little ""sticky"" to me, and the fabric part that goes through the toe area was a little thick and took some getting used to. I wore them for a few days before taking them out on a job and I can't get over how comfortable they are. Ii have been wearing these shoes now for 3 months, every work day and I am THRILLED. No more back pain, no more sore feet. I also wear these sometimes during my off time,mans every time I wear them, I get compliments on how cute and comfortable they look. The great thing about these shoes is the yoga matte bottom. It helps your feet grip to the shoe a bit, so your foot can just walk normally, without having to grip the shoe. You may not realize it, but with a lot of Sandals, your foot is having to work to keep the shoe on, changing the way you walk and stand and ultimately causing foot and back pain. Not with these! Also, the soft linen sits comfortably on your skin and breathes nicely in the heat. The only downside is the funky tan lines, which is why I am sure to alternate shoes on my days off, especially if I plan to be outside for most of the day. If it were not for that, I think these might be the only shoes I'd wear all summer. If you are looking for a reasonable priced, comfortable shoe that you can wear and walk in all day.",5.0,0

"Our son received this toy as a gift when he was born.  We were a little worried about putting toys in his crib, but soon got over that when we realized how well he reacted to Pooh and the music!  Yes, it is a little loud for a lullaby toy, but the volume has never seemed to bother him -- he sleeps right through it.  When he was still in the infant stage, we used the remote control constantly to restart Pooh from the comfort of our bed if our son hadn't fallen asleep yet.  It's great that the remote allows you to select your starting point: the toy comes with three ""stages"" of songs, moving from singing to just music to soft music and bird chirps.  We would replay the softest music when the baby was nearly asleep, the singing when he was still fussy and needed more distraction.  He is one year old now, and he has learned over time to turn it on and off (push the cloud on the pillow).  We know he's awake when Pooh starts singing!  Quite often he hasn't quite had enough sleep, and he turns Pooh on, curls up with his blanket, and goes back to sleep.  The little light under the cloud is a great bonus, since it gives the baby a little ""comfort light"" when Pooh starts to sing (the light fades out as the music softens).  Our son LOVES this toy -- we couldn't imagine bedtime without it!  ONLY drawback (and it's negligible)--he loves it SO much that we really go through the AA batteries!  All things considered, that's a pretty good ""problem"" to have.  We highly recommend this toy.",5.0,0

"As stated by the title...this product is NOT FOR TALL PEOPLE!  The zippered opening does not allow for someone much taller than about 5'11"" to get into it.  If you are short, you can get into the costume easily feet first.  If you are tall, you must go in head first, lay down and cross your legs and get someone to help you put your feet into the correct places.  I could BARELY bend my legs enough to fit them into the leg openings, even having wiggled my shoulders up into the head area as much as I could.  Now as long as you're under that height I mentioned, your weight doesn't matter a bit.  It's a very forgiving costume and would be very easy for a plus size person to wear.  I don't know what the limit would be, but we were able to get my ~300lb friend into it with no trouble.

The fan makes an annoying sound...so it's not like you could wear this to work and sit at your computer quietly.  But changes are...you're going to be running around like an idiot at a party in this thing so nobody will care about the fan whirr.

It does get hot inside and you will fog up the thing.  There's no way for this really to be avoided.  Costume feels super cheap when you take it out of the package and you'll need to find somewhere inside the suit to secure the fan.  I'm unable to wear this costume without having someone help me get in and out of it, due to my height, but if you're shorter you should be able to manage ok.

You can run, walk, bicycle, drive, sit, dance, all very easily.  It's very light and if you bump into something, it just deflates that part and fills right back up quickly.  Fun to run around in and scare children.",4.0,0

"My cat, Raoul purchased this during a nocturnal shopping spree. We got him his own credit card with the hope that occasional nighttime internet shopping would entertain him while the rest of the household slept. This works out pretty well most of the time as he usually purchases small inexpensive items such as cans of tuna, bags of Pounce, and electronic dog whistles.

One night, however, he watched&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Amelia/dp/B0036SLOP8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Amelia</a>&nbsp;on Amazon Instant Video and he became extremely interested in flying.  For a few weeks he would climb up on to a tall bookcase and spring, legs outstretched, usually on to the sleeping dog, but sometimes at any unsuspecting passerby.  He must have eventually become bored with free flight because this Cat Airplane arrived one day. Raoul set upon assembling the cardboard pieces and although he was quite methodical, it was beyond his physical ability to complete the job. Of course, we assisted him; the propeller assembly being extremely difficult even for us with thumbs.

At last, the cat airplane was finished and the first thing we noticed is that the cockpit was rather a tight squeeze for a big fellah like Raoul.  He was quite determined and was barely able to squeeze himself in, but he eventually did.  Once in, he really looked fantastic! Purring like mad, he tried to find the controls, but there were none.  Thinking that he had mistakenly purchased a glider, he requested that we lift the plane (with him still inside) up to his usual bookcase perch and then give him a shove. Needless to say, we refused!

It took lots of explaining on our part to convince Raoul that he had not purchased a real plane but merely a toy. He is quite disillusioned now. He mostly sleeps or sits and stares off into the far distance, a cat with shattered dreams.

I have several nieces and nephews and they enjoy spending time with my daughters but they always leave a mess. These flashing toy rings are perfect for having them entertain themselves for a while without creating a mess.
What I found unique about this ring set is that there were various different styles of ring. From a rose, to bumpy, to spikey to a star! I like the variety of them. This box comes with 36, which is actually a lot more than other types of rings I have purchased in the past. I am extremely glad that this box comes with such variety.
Something to note, is that these rings are sticky like the sticky hands that come from the old school coin machines. I was a little bit surprised at this, because I do not know that this is stated in the listing. I expected a soft gelly plastic, but not the sticky kind. Either way, I did not have any issues with them. Of course though, once my daughter dropped it in the dirt, it got all sticky with dirt. I rinsed it off and it was fine, and it still lit up!
Another great detail is that this flashing light comes with the little light inside that flashes with 4 great colors. Again, this is another aspect I was not expecting. It produced great colors and a very bright light. The quality is superior to any other flashing ring I have purchased for my kids.
These are a great item for parties, or just for keeping the kids busy. Very nice, and made of out a soft material that stretches for everyone. My daughter was able to put hers on her wrist.

They all love music, singing and dancing, and this toy has given them hours of pleasure as they listen and sing along to some of their favorites like ""Head and Shoulders, Knees and Toes."" Plus included in the box are the lyrics to the songs just in case, as an adult, you don't know them! You'll be singing ""If You're Happy and You Know it"" with embarrassing frequency as it tends to stay in your head just like when the song came out!

The kids are able to record their own songs as well as sing to the five included prerecorded ones. The mirror is fun for the baby to laugh and giggle at himself as he watches the girls dance around the room singing in the microphone.

A plus for parents or adults is that the toy is easy to put together! The four legs snap into the base and are held there with a screw. No complicated diagrams or instructions.

If your child loves music, this is a great durable toy that can provide hours of fun and will hold up under toddler play!",5.0,0
"My doc has been after me to use Hibiclens for a chronic skin problem I've been suffering with.. Problem was I couldn't afford it.  So being a rather resourceful person, I figured it out.  If a Vet. grade product that is used on animals is safe, and it is the same basic chemical as Hibiclens (without all the dyes and perfumes) then what the heck do I have to worry about?  So I tried it, and it worked. But the real test came when I went back to my doc and told her that although I could not afford Hibiclens, I got a Vet. Grade product of chlorhexidine and used it.  Her response? She smiled and gave me a thumbs up!  In other words folks, if this stuff is safe for Fluffy it's safe for you too.  That is, as safe as any chemical might be.  Use your head, read, dilute the stuff (one ounce per gallon). Don't get it in your ears and eyes and please first mention it to your doc that you intend on doing this. They are the professionals, and if it's not good for you they will say so.  Always check with your doc. And I don't mean Dr. Google.",5.0,0

It looks like a real fire truck in action but in a toy version, very cool.

"I have several pairs of Timberland boots and love them all. This pair is no exception. Great quality. Sturdy and durable. Cute and versatile. The only difference that sticks out is that it isn't as comfortable as my other pairs. It's kind of stiff all around (including the foot bed), but perhaps that'll change with more use. It's not a huge issue though - I can still wear these throughout a work day without any problems.

I got the rawhide forty color. The leather is a dark, subtle reddish brown. It's also very stiff and smooth at first, but develops large visible folds/wrinkles very quickly - I think this just adds character to the boot. I can wear these with just about anything.

The sizing is tricky. I'm normally a 7.5 (sometimes 7) and I've never needed a wide width. After reading reviews, I chose a 7 wide, which fit almost perfectly (it's just a little narrow still). So, I think this boot runs slightly long and very narrow. I also have some difficulty getting my feet in them - even with the zipper open, the entrance is a bit too small - but this isn't a huge issue either.

Overall, I really like the boot because it's versatile, cute, and seems very sturdy. I'm just deducting a star because it's not particularly comfortable or easy to get on - but again, maybe those things will improve as the leather breaks in.",4.0,0

"When this was a lightning deal recently, I couldn't resist getting this for my grandchildren.  I remember playing game after game of Connect Four with my kids when they were young.  I even played it a lot with one daughter when she had to be under a mist tent in the hospital.  It's the only thing that wouldn't fall apart!  Those memories flooded back when one of these big versions was in the waiting room at Texas Children's Hospital.  My grandson had a ball with it while waiting to have his tonsils out.  HE wasn't interested in playing by the rules (he's 3), but he liked putting the discs in and then getting them to drop out.  When he got tired of doing that, he turned the discs into pretend food to use with the kitchen set.

The downside to this is I have had to pick up all of the discs many times as the 3 year olds (he has a twin brother) scatter them every where.  Oh well, that's what kids do.  We are working on getting them to help pick them up.  At least there is a convenient way to store them.",5.0,0

"This tool box toy is a big hit with my kiddos.  There are so many things that I like about it but I do have two complaints.  So here is a basic pro/con list:

Pros:
-The drill/screwdriver actually works to spin the screws down and then has a reverse feature to pull them up.  It looks so similar to an actual drill/screwdriver that my daughter thinks hers is just like daddy's.  It is really neat how it works with the screws and the holes.

-The hammer and wrench work great with the ""nails"" and are great toys for my baby to hold and chew on.

-The interactive features are wonderful, they are very engaging and the little ""project"" cards are really cute.  I like the ones that have colors and numbers.

-The box itself is very sturdy, you can pull the top piece up and store tools underneath.  It is very well made.

Cons:

-The drill/screwdriver doesn't fit in the tool box for storing when not playing.  This makes no sense to me and I try to keep them together but I am sure my children will inevitably not store them near each other and we will misplace the drill/screwdriver piece.

-I love the project cards, however, the one card has 9 holes (which has numbers 1-9 on one side and colors on the other side), however, you only get 2 screws and 2 nails with the kit.  So my 2 year old keeps telling me that screws are missing because there is not one for each hole in the tool box, which you don't notice with the 4 hole card on top but you do with the 9 hole card.  So then she gets upset trying to find them thinking she has lost them.  I would love to see one screw in each color with a number on it and then you could work on matching the correct screw to the corresponding hole with the color/number card inserted - that would be a neat educational feature and then you would have enough screws for every hole.",4.0,0

"Fits perfectly into any existing train set but is even better as a starter set.

Strangely the green engine that comes with this set is the only train that has a problem passing under the bridge. This is out of 15 different train cars by different makers. On a perfectly flat surface its not an issue but on carpet the green engine must be push/pulled through the overpass.

My other issue is the engines don't have magnets on the front. The Thomas and Chuggington engines all have magnets on the front and back. So there are times they get ignored in favor of other trains that don't have to take the lead. However the trailing cars do have magnets on both sides.

But even taking all that into consideration this is a great buy and I'd definitely suggest it as a beginning point for any child interested in trains.",5.0,0
"I purchased My Pal Violet as a gift for my nearly year old niece because my son has loved his My Pal Scout to pieces. Violet has been an incredible hit with my niece.

She has short violet and white fur with a plastic light up ""dog tag"" with Violet painted on it. She shouldn't be washed in the washing machine but you can spot clean her a little. The white fur doesn't easily release stains after a while, and beleive me, she will accumulate stains because she will be played with all the time.

Violet runs on 3 AAA batteries that are held within a plastic, screwed shut compartment inside of her velcroed back. We keep a small screw driver with our extra batteries for the toy so that changing them out is not such a problem.

She comes with a USB cable because it is a customizable toy if you own a computer. I will say that the better your internet connection, the better off you will be with this toy. Leapfrog doesn't have the easiest to navigate site. It is not user intuitive and usually takes a couple of tries to get any of our Leapfrog toys customized. The sync function at the end is an especial pain.

Violet has an ""on/off"" paw, a bedtime music paw, a musical paw with popular children's songs, and a paw that makes Violet talk with customizable phrases. You can make the bedtime music play for longer amounts of time by pressing it multiple times. You can customize what children's music the other paw plays. The remaining paw is conversation for your child and it is priceless to have the toy say ""I love you, (insert child's name)"". It also is customized with info such as you child's favorite food and color. Some of the conversation can be a little nonsensical but that is part of the fun, I suppose.

If it were a breeze to program and a little more educational, I would give it 5 stars. It is a great toy though and I wouldn't hesitate to buy it for any child.",4.0,0

"I bought these shoes for a dual purpose.  I need a good sturdy boot to work around my horse farm.  I also needed a strong shoe that is fit to ride in, so when chores are done, I can just jump on one of my horses without going into the house to change.  In addition, I'm taking a sightseeing trip this summer and will be on my feet at least 12 hours a day.  These boots completely fit the bill.

They are attractive enough that they look great with jeans or khakis.  They look especially cute with white socks and walking shorts.  They are not too clunky, they look like brown sneakers/shoes.  They were so comfy from the moment I put them on, that no breaking in period was required.  I stomped through the mud and water and my socks stayed nice and dry.  I worked outside for a good 12 hours, the first time I put them on, and when I got in the house, I felt good, my back, knees and feet felt just fine, all of which I have trouble with.  They are true to size.  I will replace them with another pair when they wear out.  Money well spent.  I recommend them highly.  I'll buy another pair if I find them in black.

These bags are sized just right for their purpose and they have paw prints on the bags making it easy to know which side is up and which side is down so I can tell where the opening of the bag is to insert the waste product. I also love the fact that the bags tear off easily from the roll. I am a senior person and some of the bags I have purchased in the past were really hard to tear from their rolls. The only problem I have with this product is with the dispenser  that the company supplies with the bags. I don't know if I am doing something wrong, but I can't pull the bags out of the dispenser correctly; thereby I don't find myself using this little green holder.

Our cat took a leap on top of it ONCE (never again) and the top pole is noticeably bent.  Granted, it's not supposed to be jumped on; in hindsight, the cloth tent is not a good option for cats that are naturally going to jump on surfaces.  Also, the sides of the litterbox lid get stuck on the sides of the tent so opening the lid is not smooth.  The window at the back of the tent that is supposed to allow you to get to the buttons and settings is a joke.  Not only is it difficult to see what the settings are, but there's no way you can stick your hand into the tent AND see what you're doing at the same time.  It does allow the cord to be plugged but there's no other benefit to the window.  I haven't decided what we will try next but this purchase is a bust.",2.0,0

"**UPDATED AT THE END**

When we got our new dog, my wife and I decided that we were only going to go with good products that didn't contain any harsh chemicals! After searching around a little, we decided on Cain & Able because I love the smell of Peppermint and Tea Trea is a wondrous plant!

GENERAL
First off, this shampoo smells great out of the bottle! It's not too strong after our puppy is dry, but it really does leave a very nice smell on her. I can't say that the pump is as bad as some people have mentioned, but then again we only have a 21lb dog so we don't have to use all that much on her!

EFFECTIVENESS
We have noticed less itching from our dog, something that has nothing to do with fleas, but according to our vet probably something to do with her diet before we got her (she was a street rescue). She doesn't seem to desire to lick it once she has been washed, but even if she did we feel a lot better knowing that there are no artificial perfumes and chemicals that might be bad for her! We can't comment on the effectiveness of being an insect repellent, but both of the main ingredients are known to be natural repellents and we feel safe knowing she is protected!

WHY 5 STARS??
- Great value for a safe and earth-friendly product
- Smells GREAT!
- Contains no harmful chemicals!

OVERALL
Overall we are very happy with this purchase, and our puppy seems to love it! I highly recommend this product, especially if you care about what seeps into your dog's skin!

**UPDATE 03/2012**
We have been using this shampoo exclusively for over 5 months now, and we are still VERY happy with it! Our dog doesn't itch at all any more and her coat is shiny (a good diet greatly helps this)! We will continue buying this product unless we happen upon anything better!",5.0,0

But, it could be a lot better.  The camera lens zoom and focus is pre-set and not adjustable.  The only way to change the zoom is to physically move the camer back or forth.  This makes finding a place to hide the camera much more difficult and challanging. The mounting bracket also adds to the challenge--it doubles the height of the unit, and is intended to be mounted with the included, tiny wood wood screws.  Using the the knob on the receiver to fine tune the reception from the transmitter is what migraines are made of--keep the Tylenol handy. It's similar to trying to fine tune the dial on an am clock radio with week reception.

"Functional, yes. Durable? We didn't get off to a great start together, this Pescadero 20 Carry-on and me.

I opened the package to find a loose zipper pull falling out at me and I couldve just ended my review there. Based on the other reviews, Im not the only person that received a flawed item out of the box. Id be wary of it and Id be wary that the other zipper pulls won't last. My internal zipper for the liner on the side of the handle also was missing a zipper pull altogether.

In terms of actually using the Pescadero to travel, it does reasonably well and holds itself up as a four-wheel spinner should, including its telescoping handle. I took it on a car trip, which is probably as much as I care to trust it. I like that its lighter than other 20-inchers Ive used before, although you can pay a premium for lighter weight specs if you choose elsewhere.

However, for flying, I don't like that it doesnt have any other exterior access compartment, nor does it have a TSA lock and no internal pockets. For a hard-shell exterior, its less rigid compared to my current hardshell. I can push the exterior in too easily with my hand alone. I cant put my trust in it and leave a proven, durable case behind when it will inevitably get checked and beaten on by baggage handling.

I'm very glad I decided ( at the last minute ) to get the 32 gb model. I'm not using the iPod portion that much --some music and podcasts, but the add on apps have been very VERY useful. The screen is gorgeous , the keypad easy to use. If I had to quibble I'd say my biggest gripe is that flash and shockwave don't work yet. I know why apple has done that, but it's inconvenient.

I decided to purchase a newer canister type filter.  The reason for this is my 54 gallon tank had been shut down for 3 months with only the dried up gravel in it.  So I started it back up in October of 2014 with my Magnum 350.  I decided to test my tank for ph and ammonia levels and found out that the ammonia was 1.0 ppm too high.  Of course I immediately dosed the tank with Ammo Lock.  Other then that the tank was doing well with no fish in it as of yet.  Because of the ammonia I went to my local pet store supplier and purchase the Aqua top CF400UV.  Installed it and within 24 hours the tank started to cloud up.  I made several water changes and cleaned the filter several times over a period of 2 weeks to no avail.  I contacted my local supplier and they replaced it thinking it must have been defective.  Well! The tank never cleared even after another 10 days of water changes and filter changes.  So I thought I would reinstall my Magnum 350.  Within 12 hours my tank was nearly clear.  After 24 hours it was crystal clear.  So I guess I have to say that I either got two defective filters or the Aqua top 400 UV just could not handle my water condition.  I have over 30 years experience with fish and tanks and I am baffled by this.  I found the filter easy to use and to be very quiet.  Just as an FYI for others who are new to this non self priming filter.  You should fill the canister first about 1 from the top and install the cover then fill the in and out inlets.  Hook it up and just press the primmer button twice or more and just turn it on and you are good to go.,1.0,0

I got this for my son who is about 5'2"", he loves it. He wears a size 6, and it fits him perfectly. He has lots of room in his shoulders and it's very flattering. He loves the ""top of the head"" which is a nice touch. It's also a little hard to pull off, but he loves it. He's 5'8"" and the top fits him perfectly. He says it's a little stiff but that's how it feels on him. He wears it with pants and it's a great way to wear it. I'm very pleased with the purchase and would definitely recommend it. I'll be ordering more colors. I have a narrow foot, so I ordered a medium and it's a little big on me. I'm a 36B and it's very comfortable.

Also, my Pomeranian has a liver condition and as a result he drinks a ton of water and pees a lot! So he always ends up with wet paws, which meant he wet the floor every time he used the pee pad.

"My kids love these soft, bright cars.  Each one is a different vehicle in a different color--they are bright appealing and a great little toy.  Pull one back and let it go--and it zooms across the floor easily! Thing is, my kids are older than 2 and so a little past the age for this particular toy.  So it was perfect when my 1 year old nephew came to visit and we could test drive them with him!

Huge success.  The lightweight, plush design makes them easy for him to grab and hold onto.  He hasn't quite got the zooming thing down yet, but I'm sure he'll get the idea soon enough with my children's avid assistance.  My nephew is drooling quite a lot now (teething) so the cars inevitably got coated in drool and later on in banana.  That's when the particular cleverness of these really became apparent.  The plush tops can be unlatched from the wheel base (just undo the velcro) and washed off without the worry of getting the car mechanism wet.  And while these are certainly an appropriate toy for a one year old, I wouldn't likely leave him with the cars without supervision (just in case a wheel could be pried off), but we can take the car base off and let him play with the plush tops all on their own!

A great toy, and a great gift.  For parents and gift-giving friends who want a toy that's fun but doesn't require batteries and won't send everyone crazy with repeating sounds and lights--this might be just what you're looking for!

Happy playing! ^_^ Shanshad",5.0,0

"The 810 is an awesome case don't get me wrong. I really like it and am glad I picked this case after doing some research. I gave it 3 stars because there were a few things wrong with the case I noticed while re-assembling my PC. First there were a few blemishes on the paint, not horrible but still noticeable. The paint itself seems like it could get damaged pretty easy. Second, a section were the PSU is mounted was bent, but it didn't hinder the installation, just a little OCD kicking in. Third, the LED light in the back doesn't work (not sure if i missed a plug or anything) so there's that. Fourth, the fan's are nosier than I expected but that's remedied with a fan controller.

All in all the case is still great and is a huge upgrade from an Antec 900. But the 810 did come with a few unexpected imperfections. Not sure if it's because I purchased my antec from newegg and the 810 from Amazon but the antec was in pristine condition even though it arrived in a beat up box. Expected the 810 to have nothing wrong since the box seemed pretty mint, but i was mistaken.

I understand stuff like this happens, but for $170 this case should have nothing wrong with it. As a side note the case is packaged in a semi-soft foam, which was partially destroyed upon opening the box.

Hopefully there is nothing else wrong with the case.

"I've used OtterBox before for my phones and have had nothing but great things to say about them so I was interested to see what they do with an iPad case.

Unfortunately, my experience was not the best. Don't get me wrong, the case is fantastic at what it does: protect your iPad. It's not just a good fit for how I use my iPad.

The majority of the time I use it, I'm holding it. I tried every way I could think of but the floppy folding cover was just not comfortable in my hands. A lot of the apps I use require it to be in landscape mode and the edge of the case by the home button moves away too easily when holding it this way.

Probably my biggest issue is the clasp. Maybe it's the kind of thing that will loosen up a bit with use but it is difficult to open. It's not a huge inconvenience to have to futz with it a few seconds but the fact that I have to means there is a problem.

Overall, this is a decent iPad case. It's not for me, but a lot of people have given it great reviews so maybe it'll be good for you.",3.0,0

"Best value non smart tv on amazon. This review is of the 39 inch model. I did a lot of research and at the time this was by far the highest quality and best value at this price point and size. It's not a smart tv but most smart tv's apps are hard to use and poorly implemented besides I have an xbox and chromecast so I don't care about it being a dum TV.

Picture: super bright amazing image quality for the price point this tv will not disappoint! Extremely customizable image settings allow you to adjust the picture just how you want it. A quick google search will yield settings that work well but I had to fiddle with the backlighting and black levels to get it how I thought looked best.

Sound: other reviews say sound sucks on this tv. The sound is actually quite good as long as it's not mounted to the wall. When wall mounted or pushed up against the wall the sound sounds tinny like how your cellphone speaker sounds when placed speaker down on a table. When the tv is on a tv stand one foot from the wall it has great, clear very loud sound that is more than adequate for my use. That being said a external subwoofer and/or sound bar would be advisable for anyone who likes a lot of extra ""BASS""

On picking it back up, the propellers were spinning at full speed (with the throttle off) and smoke was coming out of the battery compartment.  I quickly removed the battery, and could see where the circuit board had caught fire.  So, this one is being retired after one use.  I'm not risking hurting someone or damaging property.

It does occasionally but it works pretty well in general.  Now for the negative...and it has become big enough for me that I can't recommend the device.  The ipad and keyboard, when in the closed position, does not clasp shut.  The ipad rests in the closed position on top of the keyboard.  It easily slides off, but more often, it moves just enough to turn the ipad on and wear down the battery.  At least once or twice a week, I go to use it and it is dead because it just sat on for 12 hours. You can't see that it is turned on.  It is so frustrating. I don't know why they didn't make a clasp or connector to keep the thing closed.  Normal travel is bound to jar it open just enought to turn it on. Ugh.

"This skirt is TINY & TIGHT. I'm talking SKIN-tight. For reference I'm 5'7 and 175 lbs I usually wear a size 10. I originally ordered a size XL (which according to the manufacturer is a size 14 - 16, which is WAY bigger than I ever wear). It was STILL TOO SMALL and insanely TIGHT. I ordered an XXL (which apparently is a size 18-20!!!!!) It's a bit looser around the waist, but still pretty tight the rest of the way down. Honestly - and surprisingly - this skirt is really probably most flattering on a smaller sized body - guess they don't call it a pencil skirt for no reason. I do think it's extremely cute though, despite it not being the best fit.

Two other things: you can absolutely see a panty-line. You can't see through all the way to the undies, but the line is quite obviously there.

Second, I ordered the ""coral"" color, which looks neon pink in the pictures, I was pleasantly surprised to find out when it arrived that it's actually not neon pink, but a very pretty baby-pink color.

"This is a review for the Disney Princess's: Sparkling Princess Series Collection by Mattel and Disney. Overral this doll is very amazing!  The doll has a golden sparkly crown, (Instead of a bow, we are treated to a nice crown) overall the crown is very satisfying, I really like the extra sparkle in the crown. Snow White's dress is gorgeous as well, the top part is blue with blue sparkles along with a red bow on the end of the top, on the top sleeves we have a puffy part of the sleeve that is baby blue with red color as well added along with it, kinda like a pattern. Next on the bottom part of the dress we are treated with a yellow sparkly color, this part of the dress is probably the most sparkled part of the dress. What I really enjoyed was the cool pictures of apples made out of the yellow sparkles, In Snow White she ate a poisonous apple, which was why this was included in the outfit. But I eventually found out in the Sparkling Princess Mattel Barbie Collection is that they also included different pictures symbolizing parts in the treasured Disney classics in the other dolls as well. The last part of the outfit is the red sparkly shoes, which stay on pretty nicely. Overall I rate the outfit a 5.0. Other than the outfit we have Snow White herself, who in my opinion is one of the prettiest Snow White dolls in the Disney Mattel Doll Collection. She has brown eyes, (Doesn't have much makeup which actually makes her look even more pretty) plain black hair, and pink lips. The only thing that didn't appeal to me was the regular looking skin, which in the story she is described to have ""skin as white as snow"", which her skin isn't pale. Actually I bought the Cinderella Sparkling Princess doll as well and found out her skin was more pale. But overall it doesn't bother me. I rate the whole thing full five.",5.0,0

"We've had to switch brands multiple times when buying bully sticks.  The last one we loved but they are out of stock and no ETA on when more will be in.

These seem to be larger on average than others we have purchased, like someone picked the best ones ahead of time.  That was nice since even at the pet store, you might not have enough to pick that many choice ones.

But more importantly, they are the darker color my dog seems to prefer.  Some brands started out this way but then started selling packages were the sticks were more golden in color, and my dog didn't like those much.  I don't know if it's a change in how they process them, or what animal it comes from, but the dark ones seem to be the best.

I have a male Samoyed and when he's in the mood he'll reduce one of these by half or less in pretty short order, maybe 30 minutes or so, then finishes the entire thing later.  When they are good he'll even eat up any small pieces.  He's a big dog at almost 70 pounds though, and only water buffalo horns and bones last any length of time.

I've seen many reviews on many bully sticks wanting 'odorless' sticks.  I've not noticed them to be overly stinky but, it is a dried piece of animal, it does smell a little bit.  I don't even notice it unless I'm sitting by my dog, though.",5.0,0

Purchased to store my 7.5' full Christmas tree with lights.  The bag worked well; handles are sturdy and there are enough of them sewn around the bag they are actually useful.  The bag is now hanging by one of those handles with no issues of tearing, ripping, or shredding.

Tree was 3 pieces, I wrapped the tree sections with that stretchy cellophane packing wrap - best way I can imagine to control the needle fluff. That left me a 4' x 24"" base, a 4' by 18"" mid section, and a 2' x 12"" top.  Base went in large end first, mid section skinny end first, and that left a lot of room for the top at the opposite end of the bag; also dropped a few more Christmas display items in for good measure.

The result was heavy; but lifting the bag didn't result in any tears or punctures (honestly, I was expecting one of the pole ends to push through at some point).  Once I had the bag where I wanted it, I tied a rope to one of the end handles, and hoisted the bag off the floor.  Now the tree is out of the way, and stored in a good spot where it won't get banged around.

The duffel bag is probably too big for most any other use I can imagine; but was perfect for storing my $400 tree.  Though I may buy another to store ALL of my camping gear in one spot and allow me to lift it off the floor, too. Hmmm...  glad I wrote this review :)",5.0,0

"Having an elderly cat (18) and two younger cats, we were running into issues where the regular food was to hard for my old fellow to chew, and in a very short period of time, he lost a lot of muscle, dropping from 17 pounds to only 10. I tried some specialty ""older cat"" food that stopped the weight loss, but of course both of the younger guys (a 22 pound Ragdoll and a 16 pound tabby mix) thought that the food the elder got was best, and protested their food, too. And, of course, the food is OUTRAGEOUSLY expensive to feed to three large cats, two of which are super active.

Evolve was the fix. It is soft enough that the old guy's soft gums don't complain, and as a plus, we've seen a major difference in cleanup requirements, as none of the cats upchuck or have diarrhea anymore, and the large dander (cat dandruff!) has all but disappeared. We still use a wet food supplement for the older cat (which, of course, the young guys love, too) to maintain his weight and health until he passes, but we are in the region now where we won't have to auction off one of our teenagers just so we can feed the cats!",5.0,0

"Back and better than ever!!! I had both Shrinky Dinks and TMNT Toys as a kid and it's so cool that everything is back for the new generation. What's even better now is that the plastic is pre-cut so there's no sharp plastic edges like before. It's little things like that which make a big difference. So does the play set. Wow! It's a 3d backdrop to play with the creations on. There's all the turtles and villains too.

The kit includes the pencils and everything needed to color, create, and play. You just need your own oven and baking sheet. Adult supervision is needed on this one but they can color on their own. It's more fun than coloring in coloring books... so much fun to create you'll want to do it with the kids, especially if you are sentimental for Shrinky Dinks of the 70's-80's.

If you're not familiar with Shrinky Dinks, once baked the little flexible flat plastic sheets shrink, harden, and thicken to become permanent hard plastic play pieces. You can even poke a hole before baking and hang them on a necklace.",5.0,0

"I have a golden retriever that is my service dog. He has been working with me for over three years now. He always goes with me and even though the ADA does not require a service dog to have a vest, I have him wearing one because it makes it easier for us to go out in public. I have several different vests, but I was looking for a non-tradional and lightweight one. This one is great. I love the gray pattern and it is super lightweight. I also like how it is not only breathable, but it really lightweight. This had some padding, but it was easy to sew patches on it. It is anti-tug and very easy for my dog to wear. It fit him nicely, but could be a little tighter. It could be a little bit tighter, but it will not adjust any tighter. This is a nice harness and came with a series of patches. I can either wear these patches or I can remove them and add saddle bags. The handle isn't really good for mobility, but it is overall, a really sharp looking vest.

"This one works with my Chevy factory cassette deck and my iPod. Perfect.

In frustration, I came back to the cassette adapter concept. Thanks to a previous reviewer who mentioned that this adapter works with GM factory cassette decks and others won't. I purchased this adapter and the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Griffin-9749-PJBLK-PowerJolt-Auto-Charger-for-iPod-Black/dp/B000FIQC5E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Griffin 9749-PJBLK PowerJolt Auto Charger for iPod (Black)</a>&nbsp;and it's a near-perfect solution for me. There's one more wire to deal with, but the sound quality (no static, no auto shutoff) is worth it.

Update 3/28/09: After about a year and a half of occasional usage, the tape deck stopped liking the adapter. It would try to change sides a couple of times and then eject the adapter. Maybe something wore out? I purchased a replacement unit and it works fine, so it wasn't the deck. Someday I'll own a car with an iPod port...

Update 12/8/09: The second one stopped working last month--that is to say, the tape deck started rejecting it. Eight months of very occasional use? I would really like to know what part is wearing down and causing this. I purchased another new one and we'll see how long that one lasts. If this one doesn't work out, maybe I'll just go buy a handful of cheap ones at the 99 Cents Only store.

Update 1/24/10: The third one stopped working, but I don't think it's the adapter; I think it's my cassette deck. So I can't really blame the adapter. I purchased an inexpensive FM transmitter (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Apple-iPod-FM-Transmitter-Car-Kit/dp/B002US9SSK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Apple iPod FM Transmitter Car Kit</a>) and it works great so far, with a lot less frustration.",5.0,0
"Having bought a new case, i got a whole bunch of fans to go with it.  despite them being able to be used with out a fan control, i decided to get one, because i realized that the fans can be quite loud. so i got this.
definitely worth the $20 or so i paid for it. it installed like a breeze (note that it'll fit into a slot that a normal sized CD/DVD drive would fit into).  It can control up to 5 fans and it'll vary speed and in the case of my fans brightness of the LEDs.
When the fans (5 of them) are full blast, it can get pretty loud. i usually don't turn them up to full blast unless doing something strenuous to my computer like playing games doing some data analysis of huge data sets.
overall good and worth the investment for a more customized computer. probably not very useful if you have 1 fan.",5.0,0

"Wow, I cut a small dog off my dog!  I used to cut my kids' hair when they were little and they always threatened to hold me down and cut mine one day.  Photos will show I was not good at it.  So with clippers and a dog, what could go wrong?  The dog, a shaggy little Border Terrier who had a 7 month growth of hair.  Never having been a good one for reading instructions, I jumped in and started playing with blade guards.  The middle one was the best place to start and then I started testing guards to see which one cut closer.

After an hour and lots of fun, there was a small dog of hair on the ground, but my real dog still looked like she could lose a little more hair.  Hey, it will grow back, right?

My back took a rest while I had a cool drink, then I plopped the dog on the patio table (duh, should have done this to begin with) and started cutting with just the clippers and no guard.  Whoohoo, first cut took out a divot.  Damn, these things are really cool.  As I developed a smoother stroke, we ended up with a really passable haircut.

What I learned: do not cut a wet dog and it will grow back.

I saved about $40 bucks for a haircut and had an immeasurable amount of fun.  Now, what else can I trim?  The other 3 dogs are all short haired, but wait....hey cat, come back here!",5.0,0
"Needed some long cables to hook up charging stations for my wife and my Kindles at our bed.

These do the trick.  Nicely constructed with solid feeling connectors.

Best thing about these is they are supple but not flimsy.  Many cables have a tendency to revert to their coiled status after long periods of being packaged which makes running behind furniture and such a royal pain.  These go where you put them and stay there, lying flat and not trying to curl up out of reach under the bed.

Most cables are good and these are better than most.  Both ends plug in solidly without undue force and with no feeling of ""slop"".  I've had many that tend to slide back out of the Kindle end of things without warning.  These do not do that.",5.0,0

"I ordered this tea set last week, after reading many reviews and contacting Green Toys. I asked the company about the leaky teapot problem which was mentioned in several lower-star reviews. A company representative responded, assuring me that the design of the teapot had been changed to fix the leak problem.
It is evident that the leak problem has been fixed; it no longer has a seam around the middle of the teapot that was causing the leak problem. It should be noted that the lids of the teapot and sugar bowl are no longer interchangeable; the teapot lid is much bigger than the sugar bowl.

I love that the set is cute, made in the USA, dishwasher-safe, able to hold liquid, and came in awesome packaging (even though that only matters when you first get it, it's so nice to have the frustration-free packaging! Why can't every company package items this way?)

I originally gave this 4 instead of 5 stars because:
  The tea set seemed smaller than I thought it would be (but it's actually just right for my 2-year-old, so I actually wouldn't want it any bigger)
  The green plates are  a lime green instead of the soft pastel pictured
  The teapot lid isn't as pictured (but is now leak-free!) and isn't interchangeable with the sugar bowl lid
  While the set appears durable, there are some small flaws that appear to have occurred in the manufacturing process. My daughter tripped and fell on the sidewalk while carrying a teacup and the plastic is scraping off a little bit from where it hit the ground.
  You may need to have your toddler hold the lid while pouring. It stays on with careful, gentle use, but also falls off sometimes.
  It could be priced a little lower (say $15-$18 instead of $20).

Bottom line: Definitely worth getting, not quite perfect. I would still buy this tea set and am happy with the purchase.",5.0,0

"Sizing I kept thinking, I'd hate to order these shoes and not have them fit. I read somewhere between 2030 reviews regarding Comfort and sizing. There were a significant number of complaints regarding the sizing of the shoes. 100% of the complaints were about over sizing issues. I normally wear a size 12 wide. But after reading the reviews and of course checking the sizing chart; I came to the conclusion that I would go with A size 11 1/2 m. With standard shipping (free) The shoes arrived in a timely manner. When I popped the shoes out of the box, I found a beautiful brown soft leather shoe. Now, I would not describe the shoe as a hightops or mids and of course they're not flip-flops. But the glove leather that does fit around your foot is just high enough that one would be only marginally wrong in calling them sandals. When I placed the shoes on my feet the length was perfect but the width was a different story. The width of the shoe on my left foot was dead-bang, whereas the right foot felt like it was in a vise grip. There was absolutely no problem with returning them. Called Amazon immediately and I was provided with a digital return label. Drop them in the mail and my account was credited. My only disappointment was that the shoe simply did not fit.",3.0,0

"When I selected this Barbie doll and horse play set (based on the upcoming movie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Barbie-Her-Sisters-in-A-Pony-Tale/dp/B00E95AEBC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Barbie & Her Sisters in A Pony Tale</a>) to try, I didn't realize it was remote controlled (it appears to be the only Barbie horse so controlled so far), so this function came as a complete surprise, and once I figured out that it needed 4 AAA batteries not 2 (mentioned on the box of course but surprisingly not obvious in the battery installation instructions), it functioned exactly as it was supposed to.

Controlled either by the Barbie doll remote control or by forehead button when Barbie is riding (though depending on the play area you might be able to bounce Barbie's arm activated infrared signal off the wall and make it work that way), the horse walks, stops, bows, and recovers from the bow as intended.  In our experience the horse walking worked well on smooth flooring and thin carpeting, but not (obviously IMHO) on thick carpeting.  Restarting the horse after it enters sleep mode is a little tedious (holding the button down until something happens) but better than the alternative of running the batteries down.

I can see some definite additional play possibilities if and when they start making more of these remote control horses, especially if they speed them up a bit and add unicorns so that they can be made to ram into each other.  (When I mentioned this to my 9-year-old daughter, she raised an eyebrow, folded her arms, and said, ""Daddy...."", then picked up the horse and stalked off.)

Maybe it's another one of those differences between boys and girls things.

"This review is for the Mighty Paw Leather Dog Collar.

I purchased this for my new puppy. My dog's old collar was wearing out and I came across this one and decided to try it. It looks good and seems to be made of solid material. I purchased the matching leash to go with it. I have a 6 month old bichon frise puppy and the collar was too big for him - I grabbed a pair of scissors and pierced a hole (took a few minutes to pierce through which tells me the material is good) and I cut the length as well. I did not measure the collar so not sure if the length is correct or not (as advertised) thus did not take any stars away for this.

As it turned out, she is a Bull Mastiff Mix with staffordshire terrier (aka: Pit Bull), Plott Hound, french bull dog, chinook, shitzu and silky terrier. This could explain why she is growing quickly but also she is somewhat smaller than Mastiff's her current age (now 5 months) .

"The Birthday Supplies Kit is such a great idea and will cover your bases for any small (8 or fewer) people at a birthday party. The kit includes what you need for eating & drinking--plates, napkins, cups and plastic cutlery, as well as the decorations--tablecloth, small centerpiece, balloons, streamers and curling ribbon. Oh yeah, and 12 candles!! My tablecloth is the cute panda table cloth, not red like the photo. It's actually much cuter and matches the plates and napkins in design. The whole setup looks great, buttoned up and complete.

In my experience with birthday parties, if you were having more kids than 8, it would be more affordable and less wasteful to supplement this set with extra plates & forks than to buy a second set. And most kids don't ever touch their napkins... Don't forget the hand wipes though, always good to have on hand.

This set is so useful and saved me a trip to the store, time and gas. If you got this stuff at Target, it would be so much more expensive too. However, this same stuff at the Dollar Store would only total $10-13 (plus tax if applicable) if you bought this ala carte. It could be extra from the extra cutlery.

"First, let me say the obvious; for $100 this isn't cutting edge electronics so temper your expectations accordingly.  Having said that, this is a nice little tablet for the price as long as you keep it simple.

Crisp display and at 7"" a nice viewing area.  Steams movies well with very minimal issues.
Comes with quite a few bells and whistles (so-so camera, assortment of apps, and some nice features such as weather updates and news)
Great for reading newspapers, books, and surfing non-graphic intensive web pages.

Virtually no storage area, buying an expansion card is almost a must

"My 2 year old daughter and 5 year old nieces absolutely love this toy! The playset comes with a pretty Cinderella figure, the carriage that has molds built into it, and 3 jars of Playdoh. We love that the carriage has molds you can press the Playdoh into to make the fairy god mother, her dress skirt, Jaq, Gus, birds, and a pumpkin. The Playdoh presses easily into them and comes out easily as well without ruining the mold you just made and it's easy to peel away the excess Playdoh around it. Her favorite is that the wheels of the carriage have brick imprints and Cinderella's slipper to make a stunning walkway for Cinderella to walk on. The top of the carriage is really neat that you can press it down and make pumpkin vines. The carriage itself is gorgeous and colorful and doubles as a working rolling carriage for Cinderella to ride in as well as for making the molds.

The plastic carriage is thickly made and very durable to handle even rough play from younger kids. My daughter also likes to reenact the story with the molded figures and so it can be used for dramatic play as well. She also uses her other Disney Princess figurines to interact with Cinderella, though we don't put Playdoh on them. I love the creativity and old school fun this toy offers without any ritzy technology like most toys these days.

The only downside to this toy is that it's hard to clean the Playdoh out of the vine press, but that's to be expected. It would've been nice to have a cutting tool included too. Overall, this is a big hit in our house and well worth the price, plus you can buy more Playdoh colors to go with this!",5.0,0
"I've never worn wireless earbuds before and I was a little concerned about how much they might way and just the overall comfort of them and then they arrived. These things are light and to be honest they are quite comfortable as well. I read several reviews stating that they would fall out of the persons ear so I was a little worried about that as well. I did not have that problem at all. They paired up to my phone easily and quickly and then I popped them in my ears and went to go walk down the street to get the mail. Fit fine and did not jar loose on the short walk. I then took them for a short 4.5mile run the next morning on a combination of sidewalks and dirt paths and the only time I had to readjust the earbud was when the wire that connects the two sides got pulled on by the collar of the shirt I was wearing. Other than that they stayed put and sounded great. I have not run out of battery on them and I have used them on and off for the past couple of days around the house and at the gym. The only thing I would change would actually just be adding an option for additional colors to choose from, but the bright yellow definitely makes them hard to misplace.

"I purchased the Olympus VN 6200PC years ago, so I decided to compare it with the newer Olympus VN-722PC.

At the time of purchase, I paid $43 for the VN 6200PC (I have no idea why its now listed for $144.99). The VN-722PC is currently $53.47. So it costs a little more than the original charge for the VN 6200PC. What do I get for the added price?

The VN-722PC is slightly bigger with a LED screen that is almost double the size of my old recorder. This makes it easier to read all of the settings.

Both have lightweight plastic cases but seem sturdy enough to weather the roughhousing usage of the average person.

In addition to the Menu button, the VN-722PC has a round scroll wheel that makes navigating between the settings easy. My old recorder has similar buttons but instead of round, it has a square scroll wheel.

The VN-722PC has a speaker that is about double the size of the other and it is placed on the face of the unit rather than the back like with the VN 6200PC. Plus the sound coming out of the larger speaker is nice and crisp.

The newer VN-722PC has a MicroSD slot. This would be very helpful in situations where you must do a lot of recording - such as at a convention. This way you can bring along extra cards and not worry if your recorder will have enough memory to record everything.

Format
My old recorder captures recordings in the Windows Media Audio (WMA) file format. This isn't good for me since I am a Mac person. I always had to convert the recordings before listening to them on my Mac. Whereas the newer VN-722PC saved my recording as an MP3 file - no converting needed. Yeah!!!

Manual
I found the included manual adequate to get you started, but I went to the Olympus (American) website and downloaded the more thorough digital manual.

Final thoughts
The two things that really tipped the scale in favor of the newer VN-722PC were the MicroSD slot and the saving as MP3.",5.0,0

"These made my dog sick. The other night she was vomiting all night long and had terrible diarrhea. The poor girl was so nauseated that she was dry heaving after completely emptying her stomach. It went on and on for hours. She basically was suffering the same symptoms that humans do when they have a very bad case of food poisoning, complete with chills and shivering, very sore abdominal muscles, weakness and dehydration. It was just awful for her. In the morning, of course, we rushed her to the vet. That was Saturday morning and now it's the wee hours of Monday (I can't sleep) and she's still at the animal hospital having IV fluids, anti-emetics and antibiotics. The vet hopes she can come home later today, but it might not be until tomorrow. The ONLY thing my dogs ate that was new and different in the last several days were these T-Bonz. They each got 2 as a treat. I didn't think the treats had anything to do with it until my other dog had diarrhea and threw-up a bit that morning before we went to the vet. Thankfully he only vomited once and only had a bit of diarrhea and soft stools a couple of times. My pup that got sick had a splenectomy last year, so I'm thinking that whatever was in these treats that made them sick, her body just had a much harder time fighting it off than his. I strongly recommend you NOT give your dog these treats unless you're willing to risk a hefty vet bill, a very sick and completely miserable dog, along with a miserable family, themselves all sick with worry. (Also, just in case it helps anyone or helps add some perspective and clarity: my dog that got very sick is a 20lb schnauzer female, 10 years-old. The dog with a bit stronger stomach is a cocker spaniel-mix male that's 37lbs and he's roughly 10 years-old, give-or-take a couple of years.",1.0,0

"I love scarves. Let's just start with that. So I have LOTS of scarves, plenty to compare to.
This is a very nice scarf, and I'm really glad that I got the chance to try it out.
Obviously, it is an animal print, leopard, to be exact, and the colors ebb and flow into each other, the spots varying in size, and shade, mimicking the leopard's markings, and doing a pretty good job of it, at that.
The background is tan / light brown, and the spots are dark brown and medium brown, and vary in both size and color...like a leopard's spots...go figure!
The fabric is a light chiffon, a polyester that feels like a delicate silk, really very nice.
The edges are hemmed, rather than rolled. To me, that usually means a higher quality than a simple rolled edge. There are exceptions to every rule, I know I am generalizing. Either way, this hem, while not perfect, is done fairly well. I don't see any missed stitches or big puckers, and the approximately 1/8"" hem is even all around.
The light weight of the material allows even a small breeze to move it, making for a nice look and flow.
It is a versatile piece that looks great with classic neutrals and some colors. I think it looks best with tans, browns, blacks, and ivory...but off whites, yellows, oranges would look great too.
It is versatile enough to wear with jeans and a simple blouse, but can be dressy enough to use with evening wear.
Even if you are not a huge fan of animal prints, you would still get plenty of use out of this scarf.

I've been a Salomon fan and own several older model XA Comps/XA Comps GTX and took that on many trips (from hiking in the desert to trails in Hawaii).  I now need replacement shoes since I've killed the old ones.  For athletic shoes, I'm usually a 9.  For all Salomon, I wear a 9, same for these (I also wear 9 in ASICS, but 9.5 in Nike, Brooks and Puma).

I tried on just about every major brand to look for some trail hikers/trail runners and they all fit too wide.  I also tried the Salomon XA Mission, which got rave reviews, but the toebox fits extra wide.  I also tried the Salomon Crossmax, which had a great arch but fit like a motion control shoe, so my gait felt very stiff and unnatural.

The Speedcross 3 purple looks great and the fit is perfect:  strong arch support, well cushioned, hugs my narrow feet very well, low volume toebox but still plenty of room to wiggle toes. I also love the speedlaces, easy to use and works great.

The tread is very aggressive, which is great for mud and trail.  But I will warn that walking on hard surface felt a little weird as I can feel the treads ""wiggle"" (compress, tweak side-to-side and rebound), it's a low ""wiggle"" so I don't feel unstable in any way. Not sure how the treads will wear on hard surface over time.

The shoe also feels very light for a water resistant shoe, it's not Gortex but Climashield.  It's supposed to be breathable but I haven't tested the waterproofness yet, but will testing them soon on the trail.  Highly recommend for grass, dirt, any soft surface, trail or muddy/wet conditions.",4.0,0

"Update:  I received the 600 Professional today.  First off,  this filter is very large.  It completely dwarfs both my Fluval 305 and
Marineland 350 Magnum.

I also notice that like my Fluval 305,  the Hydor is manufactured in Italy.  Something I find interesting,  given all of the aquarium
filters that are made in China.

The 600 PRO is well  constructed,  with five media baskets:  two for mechanical filtration and three for biological filtration.

The motor housing for this filter is solid and well designed, and the motor itself  is completely silent.

The motor head is secured to the 600 PRO's canister  with front and back clamps, as well as side levers which offer
a tighter seal.

Even the media trays have nice adjustable plastic straps which allow for easy removal of media, and the trays themselves fit snugly into the 600 PRO's chassis, stacked atop one another.

Aesthetically,  the entire  Hydor Professional series has a refreshingly industrial look,  which exudes quality.

The fact that this filter was discounted by about $80 from its list price only makes the aforesaid that much better.

If the Hydor 600 PRO stands up as well as my Fluval 305 and  Eheim Classic filters have, I will consider this to be money well spent.

Highly recommended!

I have been considering purchasing one of these filters since they came out.  However, they were selling at list price for quite awhile.
So I decided to wait  until the prices became more reasonable.  I just found a brand new 600 for sale on Amazon for about $150, so I decided to purchase it.  Will update my experiences.  Based on what I have read about these filters thus far, I've left four stars.

This is the largest canister filter I have ever purchased.  I also own a Marineland Magnum 350 and a pair of Fluval 305s (350 GPH VS 260 GPH respectively), so at 345 GPH this will be about as large as the Magnum 350, even though the 600 dwarfs the 350 in size.",5.0,0

"So, the original charger lasted about 3 years without a problem, then suddenly had a short at the plug end.  I bought this one to replace it.  The male plug side is too short - and will not properly seat in the XOOM to charge it properly.  When I tried to push it up, it shorted out against the housing.

If you are looking for a regular monopoly game, this is not it. You can play it like a regular game,  but that is not the intended purpose, so I would rather have the original version if I wasn't going to personalize.  I think this is a perfect gift for the one person that loves Monopoly.  We own the dot com version, spiderman, electronic, regular etc.

My boys have already personalized the cards.  Their dad is very kind and sweet and always jokes that he will ""drop the hammer"" if they don't stop whatever it is they are doing...The boys made him a card that says dad dropped the hammer, go directly to jail.  That is just one example of the personalization of cards.

See the video for the inside of the box, as well as the pieces. I thought this would help so you could see exactly how you personalize it.

Pros: Fun twist on Monopoly

Cons: Not great if you don't want to personalize.  I don't like the four folding board.  They always break! No small labels for the properties or the corresponding pieces on the board.

I was not initially that excited for this game, and once I saw exactly how you personalize it, I am really excited to complete the personalization and give it to my husband for his birthday!",5.0,0

"Having used an Apple wireless mini keyboard with a Macbook Pro at my former job, I wanted to find something similar to use with the Dell laptop provided by my new employer. A full sized keyboard takes up too much desk space, and I had gotten used to the mini layout. This was the most similar product I could find.

I've been using this keyboard and mouse for a few days now and have no real complaint. The layout is familiar, so I'm not fatfingering things. The mouse is comfortable and responsive - pretty much the same size and shape as the compact Logitech mouse I use with my home system.

Good things:

- Keyboard and mouse are both solid and well made
- They both *look* solid and well made - attractive design and finish
- They both work as they should, and well

Not so good things (and this is a fairly subjective list):

- Keyboard is a bit loud and clicky for my taste
- Took a bit of time to figure out why they keys did not appear mapped to the right characters - the num lock was on. This may be a problem with my laptop, and not the keyboard
- I wish the mouse had rubbery sides
- I wish the keyboard had a power switch

In summary, I'm satisfied with the product and consider the price very reasonable. I would recommend it to anyone who prefers a mini keyboard.",4.0,0

"Installed it on my Mitsubishi Outlander with Pioneer AVIC Z140BH head unit. Image quality is great at night or day.

CONS:
- Doesn't offer backup guide overlay like other cameras (dont know how useful it is, but would be nice to have the option)
- Doesn't offer multiple view angles like the Alpine units
- The curve of the lens seems to let water drops build up more when it gets wet which blocks and blurs the image.

I ordered them for my daughter, my husband and I are trying to get pregnant and I have gotten quite excited and have already bought a fair amount of wardrobe items.

"I pitched this fun device as a drone to my son, who thought it was the best thing in the world.  We took it to the local soccer field and we were off! Or rather, we were off to a wobbly start.

The Jump Jet is technically a Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) vehicle, capable of rising and descending like a helicopter and buzzing around in the air like a plane.  We liken it to Windblade, the Autobot who transforms into a VTOL jet.

The Jump Jet looks like a jet but it takes off like a helicopter, which means it ascends by drifting backward and then launching upward.  It takes some maneuvering to get this right, as it's not one helicopter blade over the center but two blades, which causes the drift.  There's even a control to adjust for this drift, but good luck using those while you're trying to get the Jump Jet to take off.

Once it takes off, there's another button to transform it (see?) into jet mode.  I was torn between shouting ""Form of...a JET!"" and making that sound Transformers make when they do it, but my kids were already nervous about flying this thing in public so I decided to keep their embarrassment to a minimum.

The transformation to jet comes suddenly, which requires a completely different set of flying skills.  Where before I was simply trying to keep the thing from crashing into the ground or to a child, now it's a matter of keeping it aloft and moving forward.

I took me several tries to get the Jump Jet to take off, transform into jet mode, fly around, and then transform back into helicopter mode to land.  By the time I finally managed it, it was out of power.

My eight-year-old tried this several times and was never able to get it, but he was very helpful in running all over creation to bring it back from the latest crash landing.",4.0,0

It's been ten minutes of hardcore chewing and he's only left little yorkiepoo teeth marks on the bone (: I highly recommend this bone for dog owners who have dogs that chew through everything! this bone is great (: thanks nylabone and amazon bc this was definitely worth 13 dollars!",5.0,0
"My MacBook Pro gets hot. I have to run it with a cooling fan or it will start slowing down. (In order to keep itself from overheating, Macs manage the temperature by adding more idle processes into the queue until it's cooled down!)

I was using a different laptop cooling fan solution before this, but it was noisy and barely helping unless it was on high (extra loud mode).

When I ordered this, I was expecting better cooling from a larger fan, but the other MAJOR benefit to a large fan, and the main reason I bought this item, is that it's almost silent. Smaller fans spin faster and therefore make more noise.

This fan is almost as big as the 15"" MacBook Pro. The stand itself, leaves about 1"" around each side. You can use it with or without the stand. When sitting flat, it has a very clean and simple profile.

Finally, I love the bamboo - it was a final selling point for me.

BTW, they sell a ""pro"" version of this, with a nifty adjustable stand. I would have bought that, but it has two small fans, so it would be noisier than this one. I use this sitting flat with the lid closed and plugged into one monitor, so adjusting the angle is a moot point.",5.0,0
"I purchased 2 of these and gave one as a birthday gift to my daughters friend and one to my daughter.  It's suer cute bag and is a washable type of material.

Currently she is keeping her play medical items in it.  She [lays with it quite a bit audit seems to be holding up.  Obviously she hasn't had it for that long but it seems to be made well.  Again i really like that it is a washable canvas type of material.  So why did i only give 4 stars?

"I honestly don't know what took me so long to get one of these remotes!  It is fantastic and setup was quite easy as well.  After my initial remote setup I had to plug it into the iMac one more time to make a setting adjustment.  That is all it took, and everything is working fine.

For large fingers the center of the remote could be a little cumbersome.  The buttons seem a little close to me and I have medium sized hands.  That is the only tiny issue.

The remote emits a stronger signal than all the original remotes is seems!  I can point it anywhere and it will do the job.

"I'm a 32F, but usually find that most 32DDD's will fit me more comfortably. That said, I thought this bra would be a winner. They offered my size, and it's such a cute bra (a hard find for sizes D & up). Unfortunately, if you are like me, this bra will absolutely not fit you. The 32DDD is more of a 32 C or D.

"I have owned one of these for some time and recently got a new one for a second computer.  It's a great quality keyboard that lacks a lot of the new fangled style and shape, (thank God) of other keyboards that cost so much more and are at times far from the coolest thing around.  I'm speaking of the so called wrap around keyboards that supposedly are more realistically or comfortably designed for our hands.  Sometimes even certain keys are bigger or curled around or something or other.  My experience with them are that most have been far from the ""better mousetrap"" to be sure.  I have wavered in the past from the basic, classic idea that this keyboard is, but not anymore.  Not only has Amazon gotten it dead on with this baby, but they have also managed to improve it a little without messing up the works.  The letters on my old keyboard are not fading at all, (something that always happens on cheap keyboards with the letters used most often), but they have also separated the keys nicely so that its easy to clean and not hit two keys at once when you have fat fingers like me.  Also, this keyboard has a slight built in elevation in the back that is a better quality than the little tabs that other keyboards have that are are often flimsier.  And lastly this keyboard stays put very well with good solid feet to prevent you chasing it around your desk while working.  The only thing about this keyboard that I personally had a problem with is its USB plug.  My computer is so old it still has the rounded plug in the rear for a keyboard.  Fortunately adapters for such old time 'puters are easy to be found and I had one already.  In conclusion, if you believe in sometimes, (make that often) older or classic being better, I highly recommend this Amazon basic. Its very reasonably priced and top quality for the dollar...",5.0,0
"My 3 year old enjoys many things, running, playing ball, he loves cars, he loves play food, play cooking and feeding the dog play food. (The poor dog!) When Learning Resources sent us the New Sprouts Cook It! My Very Own Chef Set to review and my son was really excited to get busy playing with it.

The Cook It! Set is a 6 piece set with easy to hold handles that are safe for small hands, it contains a  skillet, a pot, a lid, a colander and 2 serving spoons. It is a great way for little ones to pretend they are cooking without damaging Moms nice cookware. As you can see in the photo, my son was too excited to start cooking and he took off with the pot and colander as soon as they came out of the package.

I really like that this play set compliments his play food well. It is just the right size to pretend to cook with. It is durable and easy to keep clean, and it is the perfect size for storing without taking up too much space.

The Cook It! Set encourages imaginative play and it teaches kids to be nurturing.  Whenever my son pretends to cook something for me I praise him and thank him, he feels special and helpful and this is teaching him to think of others and to be helpful while he is having fun in the process.

I have been very pleased with this play set. I like the bright colors, I love that my sometimes too rough son has not been able to damage it and that he is learning every time he plays with it.",5.0,0

"I gave this Peet dryer 5 stars because it performs in exactly the way I expected it to when I purchased it.  We have basketball shoes that need to be dried each night after practice and tennis shoes that have been out in the snow and gotten soaked.  The Peet Dryer has a button so I can choose heat or no heat.  It also has a dial that allows me to choose how long it will run.  The timer goes up to 240 minutes.
The first time I used the dryer, I couldn't really tell if it was working.  I could hardly feel any air moving out of the shoe extenders.  I was wondering if it would work... it did.  It's easy to use and fairly quiet, so I can keep it plugged in and doing it's drying job in the entry way of our home and not be aware that it's running.  The unit is pretty lightweight, but not cheaply made.  The vertical extenders that I put the shoes on are thick plastic and removable.  The center fan/digital unit is attached to the base.  I can move it from place to place easily.
I use this item everyday.  It works well to dry the inside of wet or sweaty shoes.  I would recommend the dryer to anyone who wanted to preserve and protect their shoe investment.

The middle was still not cooked, I think I went all the way to 4 minutes and it still was not cooked in the middle, So I used a glass cot cut out the middle a little bigger than the uncooked part and put that back in the microwave for 1 minute and it finally got cooked. Put the middle back in and the dogs didn't mind at all. The icing was thin and the amount was small so I stretched it with some Greek yogurt, again, the dogs didn't mind. Since all this is silliness, it's up to you if you care about how it looks. The dogs when given permission eat every last crumb and they loved it.

"I was using a mechanical keyboard that made me have to type at an angle, and the keys had some resistance going down. I didn't care  until I noticed that I was having some hand pain.

My room mate was also developing hand problems, and I brought an amazon basics keyboard for him and told him to use it to help with his hand problems. He said his hand problems are gone too.

So, I'm not going to claim that this keyboard fixes hand problems because it could have in fact been a coincidence as me and my room mate were both trying other things to fix our hand issues.

Have been trying to find an inexpensive headset like the Nike pair that I had and loved.  These are not as inexpensive as the Nikes but if they last longer, they will be worth it.

I like them and plan to stick with these - have had to return a couple of types I recently bought.  The sound is good, not  great, but for running and podcasts its what I need.  They are very comfortable.  You can wear them both over and under the ear, which is really nice. The cord gets in the way a bit if you wear your phone/mp3 on your arm but there is clip that helps keeps it out of the way.  The cord is a good length if you are keeping the phone/mp3 in your pocket.",1.0,0

"This is the fourth Skagen watch I've owned.  It's my favorite so far, but all of them have been great. The first is still working, but is looking a little worn, due to my having worn it as a ""barn"" watch whil working with my horses, and also during various other outside activities.  It even survived an accidental laundering, and still worked.  The second watch was very pretty and a little more stylish, but developed a problem with coming unlatched--lost it while shopping, and I imagine someone found themselves a nice watch. The third watch is still nice, with the exception of several broken strands of metal on the band.  I will probably have the band replaced and use it as a back up, since it still works fine.  The only other thing any of these has ever required is the occasional battery replacement.

As to my present watch, it's my favorite because I really like the style; it's small enough not to overwhelm my small wrist, but easy to read.  It's the typical, practical Skagen stainless steel, but polished enough to be dressy.  The gold tone numbers make it more versatile, as it blends well with gold tone jewelry.  The band seems to be a little heavier quality than the other watches, and was much easier to adjust the length. The only problem I can speak of, and it's a very minor one, is that the stem is a little stiff and it was hard to turn when setting the time.  This shouldn't be an issue after the initial set up, so it doesn't detract from my rating this watch excellent.",5.0,0

"I've had this for about 2 months now, and overall I like it.

The device itself works fine.  I think it may have been better for my particular picky cat if the waste was stored at the back, not by the entrance, but beyond that it rakes and stores and is super easy to change.

Where I'm less satisfied is the litter itself.  I've gone through a lot of it transitioning my cat over from his old stuff (on my 4th refill) but I can't imagine it lasting an entire month.  Beyond that, it gets everywhere.  It's a little sharp/uncomfortable when you step on it; and I'm starting to wonder if I just traded one type of work (cleaning the box) for another (cleaning all around the box...and into the other rooms it gets tracked).  I tried using the hood to contain it a little better but had to stop because my cat refused to go in that way- I'm not sure whether it was the smell, since the waste is stored by the entrance; or if it's also a little uncomfortable on his delicate paws.

"First off: the footbed is wonderful for my P.F. prone feet. Feels REALLY good right from the moment I put them on.
Second: These run wide. I have a foot that is B when not swollen (at the high end of B width) and C width when swollen (and I get swelling with some regularity). So, if you have a narrow foot, the very last closure of ankle and at toes is not gonna be narrow enough, and if you run a slender B width (slender end of that range), you'll likely find this very loose. I found it loose.
Third: the ankle strap is slightly irritating on the inner ankle, slightly.
Fourth: The front strap (adjustable) is a little irritating outer edge of the foot. This might be due to roughness in the strap, or even due to the looseness. I put it on the tightest adjustment, and it was slightly loose. That may have led to the rubbing aspect.

But that footbed! Wow, if they could perfect the sizing issues I read about and the adjustments, this could be perfect. The footbed is a dream of support for my arch and heel cup nestling.

I hesitated a while before plunking down 139 for shoes. If my feet hadn't been super-achey this month, no way. I still wonder why it is so pricey given the quality control issues (sizing issues, strap looseness in some styles, etc). But I ordered this in black and have ordered the tan, too. Despite the irritation of straps, the coddling of my soles is preicous, and when my upperfoot aches (the bones), having less constriction as this style provides helps.

The style is a bit matronly, so don't expect the height of fashion. Just nice support and comfort for troubled soles.",4.0,0

"I LOVE that they sealed the bottom of this warmer!

The new product is totally sealed and I expect to use it for many years to come!

Also, they say ""do not use with an extension cord""... but I HAVE for all of those 5 years with no problem. Who has power to their chicken coop? Unless you are a big time farmer, you probably don't. So the trick is to use a hardy, outdoor extension cord and tie it up off the ground, so it is never sitting in water. If you live in a wet location, you could seal up the plug location with plastic bags or something.

Also, this is located OUTSIDE my coop, which also is against advice. But I've placed it on a large, flat piece of flagstone. And I live in a dry climate (New Mexico) so it gets exposed to way more water just from the garden hose than the sky...",5.0,0

"If you've got a kid who is building cars in the garage they might be okay putting this together, but I'm thinking it's more for adults, both because the game Destiny is not a kid's game, and because there are some very small parts and somewhat complex instructions. At any rate, I would recommend the builder be at least 10-12 years old depending on skill level.

My wife got this and was overjoyed to begin putting it together. She found the instructions a bit frustrating at times, but had it put together in a few days with no help from me, and she's never really done anything like this before so she was surprised that she took to it so well (she really just wanted the finished product but seemed to get really into the building process from my perspective).

There are extra parts that come with the model, and the finished product is mighty cool (though a bit subdued in color, but that's Destiny for you). When you are done you'll have a nice block model to display but I wouldn't recommend ""playing with it"" unless you want to see fragile broken pieces all over your house.

"My problem- I didn't check the dimensions. Smaller than I expected and wanted but as described-kinda. The pouch will hold a tennis ball (if you push hard) but not a ball  and treats. The outside pouch will not hold a tennis ball , for the size it will hold, that size is small enough to choke your dog. It does have an inside pocket about the size of a clicker. When the pull string is tightened, it cuts off the top 1/3 of the pouch space. The construction is very durable and nicely done. So, if you have a small dog with a small ball, tiny poop bag(s), and tiny treats then this bag is great for you! My dog is a 100lb Wht. G. Shep who likes to fetch a baseball bat and tennis balls. Oh well, my error not Amazon or the seller(description a bit misleading)...I have used the treat bag now and find it great for a lot of smaller treats for my dog and probably better and less costly than the larger treats he was getting.

"Pros
-Easy installation, setup guide is well written and easy to follow
-8,000 square feet WiFi Coverage
-Easy to reach on/off switch, it is nice not to have to unplug a device just to cycle power
-Wireless Client Isolation, WiFi users can be protected from each other
-Built in Intrusion detection system
-Multiple WiFi amplifiers to make sure you get a strong signal
-Can manage up to 7 additional access points
-Can be used as a Router or an access point
-2.4Ghz and 5.0Ghz WiFi
-Includes a magnetic mounting plate and standard mounting clips

 Cons

-Only has one LAN port, sure you can get a small gigabyte switch for cheap, but that is one more thing to plug in.
-Includes many advances features not needed by the average user which can be intimidating, you are paying for all these features so if you do not need them this might not be the right device for you.
-expensive

Thoughts

Not having at least 4 LAN ports is a big negative for me given the price tag, but I think I might be able to overlook that given the powerful processor and increased range it provides.

"I purchased the H80 model when I decided to upgrade to a better case. I was unfamiliar with liquid cpu coolers, so I didn't really know what to expect. It comes with several different fittings, so you can be sure that it will fit on your motherboard. The important thing to do when researching these is to make sure you have the correct space to fit the radiator. I opted for the H80, and I'm glad I did. It seems to be very well made, I checked all the seams to make sure there were no leaks, and I checked the hoses for any cuts, and all was in perfect order.

The included instructions are kind of a joke, there a are only pictures showing the different setup for the various fittings, they don't actually explain how to install it, but it is pretty self explanatory if you have some tech sense.

All in all I am pretty happy with the purchase, I have had no problems with it, and it has kept my cpu cooler than my old cpu fan, even during long gaming sessions and photo and video editing.

The one thing that makes me give it a four star rating instead of a five star rating are the fans and the connectors. The connectors are 3 pins instead of 4, which means the fans will run on full sail the entire time. They end up sounding like a jet engine, and was so loud I could hear it downstairs through my floor. I bought a NZXT fan controller, and was able to turn them down. The noise is much more acceptable. Corsair could and should have spent the little bit more money and made the connectors 4 pin.",4.0,0

"Unpacking this suitcase I was instantly impressed with the color, weight and durability of the case. The zippers move freely and once opened the case has compartments on both sides. The left side is your standard open suitcase compartment with straps to hold down clothes and a small zippered compartment on the side. The right side zips all the way around to cover clothes packed on that side then in addition the zipper top has 3 additional pockets, 1 zippered and two open sided, built into that cover. This will allow me to pack my toiletries without adding the bulk of a toiletry case. The bag also features a built in TSA approved lock which locks down the zipper pulls keeping your items secure yet accessible to TSA inspection. The four wheels allow for easy movement on both tile and carpet.

The only thing keeping me from rating this a perfect 5 stars is the fact that just opening and exploring the case with it the sides open onto ceramic tile caused slight scratching on the small popout logo in the front of the case. This leads me to believe that the case will scratch easily during travel. If I'm wrong, I will come back and update my review to a full five starts after my upcoming business trip in 3 weeks.",4.0,0

"Hi everyone,

For those of you who don't know yet,  this cooling bracket was released several months ago before being quickly recalled due to bad hardware that caused the PCB of your graphics card to bend and make poor contact with your GPU.  Corsair released this cooling bracket again now with shorter standoffs too correct the contact issue.  I do see that there are reviews still stating bending and high Temps.  All I can say for myself is that I purchased two of these for my evga gtx 980ti's.  At first I had a very slight bend and Temps under load were 60-64C.  I was not happy with this.  I started some trial and error.  I installed the HG10 N980 bracket to my PC while running Valley benchmark.  I slowly released tension on one thumbsrew. One by one I basically got no bending of the PCB and now I got 98% GPU use & load Temps of 48C.  What worked for me was loosening up the thumbsrew at the 11 o'clock and 5 o'clock position until I saen Temps dramatically drop.  I am very happy that my 2 980ti cards are now running icy cold when paired up with 2, Corsair H75 AIO coolers.  I will admit that I shouldn't have to do this ""tinkering""  around with this bracket as that's not what it's advertised to do. Anyone who had previously had issues really should give approach a shot.  I'm a passed owner of an expensive custom water loop that ended up leaking one day & fried my $2000 gaming rig.

I bought these boots for my girlfriend and she was very excited to receive such a lovely gift. She loves that they go on so easily and yet they are incredibly secure once they are laced up. They come in a variety of colors but the blue color we chose is a lovely pairing with any type of denim. They are made fairly well and have held up great so far in their use. The pocket on the boots is great too since it provides a place to stash money or a small set of keys when you don't want to or can't put them elsewhere. She states that they are quite comfortable but despite this she still chose to put a set of cushioning insoles in them. She does this with all of her shoes and boots though. She had worn them for the better part of eight hours and was happy with how great her feet felt despite being active for so long. My girlfriend certainly didn't need another set of boots but these ones are worth having. I think they look great on her and she is quite happy with how they look and feel on herself as well.

"I have grandsons 5 and 7. 5 is average height. 7 a little tall for age. We are taking then on a long train ride from NY to San Diego with stops in Grand Canyon, lots of kid things in San Diego. I am a travel nanny by trade so being prepared is my motto!  They needed backpacks just big enough to carry a couple bottles of water an a good supply of snacks for hikes and carry their Fire for train rides. I thought this was going to be too small at first. But I easily put a bottle on outside and inside plus my Fire and plenty of room for snacks, some playing cards etc. The back has a small padded feature. I wondered if straps would fit 7 yr old and I can adjust to even fit me! Best part? So light even with stuff that even my 5 year old won't complain! The stretchy from cords can even carry a small stuffed animal for sleep later.

I will do an update after trip (if still alive) and give feedbacks. With kids, go as small as you can and still do the job!

"5 stars for customer service! Like many other reviewers on this product, the battery from Anker lasts about 7-8 months before the battery starts to swell up and making the mouse track un-clickable and the battery drains out in under 35 minutes. I contacted AnkerDirect recently through their seller page and told them about my battery issue. They asked for pics of the the battery and sent me a return label to mail in the old battery for a replacement covered under the warranty. Easy Peasy. If only all companies were this awesome. I would deal with AnkerDirect again in a heartbeat.

Now for the product itself...4 stars. I have a mid 2010 macbook, and its basically been hanging onto its electronic life by a thread. When I had to replace the original battery that came with my macbook, I didn't want to invest in a Apple battery because I wanted to only squeeze out another 18 months with my mac before upgrading to a new laptop. So this was the way to go for me, especially with the warranty. After installing, it worked great and held a charge for a good 2-3.5 hours depending on how many apps/windows were open until around the 7 month of use. If purchasing this battery keep in mind that there is a chance that you will have to replace it within a year through the warranty. If it's not a big deal to you, don't hesitate and get this battery.",4.0,0
"These are a bucket list of things you want to try out.  These are the only ones I can think of that are worth your money.

I will buy another pair.I got this for my son who is about to age out of his first year of school.  He is a big fan of the Casio leather shoes, but he loves the extra length.  The reason I got this is because I don't like the ""gleaming"" effect of the leather.  I wish the sole of the shoe was a bit longer, but overall I like the extra length.  He does not have wide feet, and the fit is good.  I bought a half size up, and the other half of the size was perfect.  He is 5'7"" and 130 lbs, and the length is a bit long for him.  I would recommend ordering up a size, but the higher the length, the better.  He is quite pleased with the quality.I ordered these in a size small and they fit perfect.

"I purchased this and the Forever Litter Tray at the same time, so I can't say much about the costliness of buying new trays every time. I use Just the Crystals instead of the name-brand stuff. With my one cat (female, average to small sized), I can easily go two weeks without touching the box and not have odor issues. I could probably get a bit more usage out of it if I mixed the litter more often instead of never, but I tend to want to be near it as little as possible.

This box has huge benefits for me. I only have to think about litter around every two weeks, there are far fewer litter granules tracked around my house and they're less dusty. My one gripe so far is that it takes up quite a bit of room, though it's far less conspicuous than a litter robot.

My cat took to it fairly quickly. I'm not sure if it helped, but I put a little bit of her old litter brand under the crystals the first time I set it up. I haven't had trouble getting her to change brands in the past.",4.0,0
"Since we started watching movies more frequently, I decided to upgrade my center speaker. After much research and thought, I purchased this amazing speaker. During this process, I listened and compared to a lot of center speakers; most of them expensive, and recognizable name brands. I am a singer and play several instruments, so I recognize good sound when I hear it. The sound of this speaker can be best described by the title of my review. The quality of the sound cannot be distorted even at extremely high volumes. If, after you buy this speaker, you do not have GREAT sound, it means that you do not have a good enough audio receiver. This speaker definitely maximized the best that my receiver puts out. Like I expected, this addition to my surround system truly added another level to our movie watching experience.

"Puzzles used to be something we did during our vacations at the ocean.  We liked to go in the off season to watch the storms and we'd always have a puzzle to work on.  When I received the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vintage-Vacations-2000-Piece-Puzzle/dp/B006ROJPD6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vintage Vacations 2000 Piece Puzzle</a>&nbsp;it brought back memories of these vacations and I was excited to start the puzzle.

First I had to find an open surface that was large enough for the puzzle.  I had hoped our card table would work, but it was too small.  I ended up putting it onto our kitchen table for the time being. As the description states it's 38.5"" x 29.5"", so not a small puzzle by any means.

Upon opening the box I was impressed that all of the pieces were contained in a plastic bag. When I cut it open and dumped them it to the box, I could see the quality of the pieces. These are very solid pieces, that do not bend easily and the edges were clean.

My daughter and I started putting it together the best way we know how, by doing the border first. This meant sorting through 2000 pieces, but it really makes it easier to start.  Once we had the border done we sorted the pieces by color and that is one of the things I really enjoyed about this puzzle. The colors were great! Vibrant, glossy and the different areas were pretty distinguishable.  Within a day we were at least a 1/4 done, two days later it was 1/2 done and by day four it was complete.

I think what I enjoyed most about this puzzle was the time spent sitting with my 18 year old daughter who is so busy these days, that we rarely see each other. She was so interested in it, that I would find her doing it at all hours.

Overall I was impressed with this Ravensburger puzzle and I'd recommend this one or any of their many others. They are great for your family and nice enough for gift giving too.",5.0,0
"I'm commenting here only about a belated experience to remark about the resiliency of this unit to water. In an attempt to move my jacket out of the way in boarding a kayak in fresh water (Rainbow River, Fl), one of the pockets of the gore-tex jacket accidentally hung out of the craft (unbeknowngs to me) when my partner sitting behind me said ""one of your pockets is in the water"". Yep, it had the Canon camera in it; it had been submerged inside the pocket for about a full minute (perhaps longer), but the pocket hadn't pooled with water, only was wet inside. Needless to say, it appeared to be a goner. The viewfinder had beads of water inside, and the screen inside showed condensation and water droplets. Also, the battery compartment had some water in it, but not pooled, but enough that I could pour out several drops from it. I removed the batteries, and over a period of about 60 hours, exposed the camera to sunlight on the dashboard and inside the glove compartment to dry out. It gradually dissapated the droplets inside the viewfinder, and the condensation from the inside screen disappeared. Only at that time did I attempt to turn it on. I couldn't believe it! The 4GB SD card was intact with the pics, and the motor successfully retracted the lens. A few trial pics confirmed that the camera is now back in working order. Call it luck, but patience prevailed in letting natural sunlight and warmth bring it back to life. I'm impressed with this experience.",4.0,0

Turning the other computer into an extended monitor is really neat and very helpful when I need a third screen for work.

"I cannot thank my boss enough for recommending Oofos sandals to me...my feet are in heaven!

My feet are wide, and flat. I call it ""Fred Flintstone Syndrome"". Trying to find shoes that a) fit correctly; and b) don't cause me to limp after a few hours is nearly impossible. I have literally spent hundreds upon hundreds of dollars in the past five years trying to find footwear that I can actually wear on a day to day basis. I have tried orthopedic inserts, Dr. Scholls inserts...you name it - I've probably tried it at least once.

Sandals were by far the most difficult to find, as most do not offer any support at all. This results in my feet taking a pounding and me being in excruciating pain within an hour or so. Unfortunately, it is hot and humid where I live from May to late September - my feet sweat easy - so I really do not want to wear closed shoes and have to deal with *that* particular issue.

These Oofos...I'm in love. I can wear these all day, and my feet are so happy. The comfort, the arch support - phenomenal. I love the black/silver color combination - it looks very classy and goes with pretty much anything I wear. Seriously, these are more comfortable than my $200 running shoes. I can't even be barefoot anymore - when I am at home, puttering around and doing chores, I have these babies on. I put them in my work tote and slip out of my dress shoes and wear these at my desk. I simply cannot get enough of them.

I will be purchasing more of these Oolala thong flip flops, in different colors. I no longer dread family outings (say, at an amusement park) because I finally have comfortable footwear to walk around in all day, without having to be the wet blanket that continually needs to sit down and ""rest her feet.""

"Revised review Dec. 2015:  I finally gave up on these and put them on Ebay!  Impossible boots.  Hard as a rock, NEVER got soft, even after mink oiling, baking, stretching... they were more like torture devices than shoes.  Could not wear them long enough to even begin to break them in, if I walked more than 2 minutes, I got enormous blisters on my heels.  Too much pain for the price!!  A lot of people here seem to love Fryes, but I will never go near a pair again.

--------------

I dithered for months before finally pulling the trigger on these pricey boots.  Can't say I love them...yet.  Well made, but for me the styling is a little off.  The foot is narrow, which isn't bad but I was looking for a ""clunkier"" motorcycle-type boot.  Had them stretched for both length and width.  And the bottom of the sole is very flat and very hard, makes a slapping noise when you walk - !!  Which I personally don't care for.  I guess I was expecting softer rubber with maybe a little tread.  These are almost like riding boots.  Have not even worn them enough to break them in.  Honestly, the $60 Steve Maddens (discontinued, alas!) are more comfortable and more to my liking.

"I needed a updated router for more devices and stronger signal.  After a lot of research, I settled on the D-Link AC3200.  The router was very quick and easy to install.

So far I have two issues with the router:
1) During setup, I was given the option of changing the router name and password, but the changes would not process.  The install wizard just sat there no moving forward in the process.  I tried again with the same result.  I finally kept the factory given name and password (which in reality is more secure than the password I would have chosen).  The wizard continued and shortly completed install.
2) Our devices randomly drops connection to the router, but will automatically connect about 1-2 seconds later.  So far, this has not caused any issues with streaming video/music/movies.  I need to research this more.  This may be caused by the router switching devices to a different band to spread the bandwidth demand evenly.

The router is considerably bigger than our old one.  This will require more space than you may expect.  This router is 15-21 inches wide depending on how you arrange the 6 antennas.  The suggested arrangement is to set the antennas at a 45 degree angle.  The router is 21 inches wide with this setup.",4.0,0

"I really wanted to love these IEMs, but I can't.

I was immediately impressed by the packaging. These buds came in the neatest, most functional little white box, kind of like the EarPod cases that double as carrying cases. But the EQ on these are awful. They're marketed as bass-heavy IEMs but that makes everything you listen to on these sound muddy. Hi-Hats are hissy and piercing, and the strange emphasis on cymbal crashes and bass make all your music and lyrics sound painfully misperformed, like every instrument and lyric is acCENTed on the wrong sylLABle. Comply tips had no effect on reducing the hissy sibilance. These IEMs don't have a microphone either, which in my eyes detracts from the value of them.

I did like that these IEMS were small enough to comfortably fit in my tiny ears, unlike most bass-heavy IEMs out there. I liked the form factor and the sleek plug and cables as well, but these two things alone didn't make this pair a keeper for me. I ended up returning them.",4.0,0

"This is my third foray into the world of inexpensive HD cameras.  About two years ago I bought a similar sized and priced Sony model - and I like the Sanyo much better.  The Sony used tape, which was less convenient, and the interface to my computer was terrible in comparison to the Sanyo.  The video quality for both is comparable.

At Christmas I also bought a Flip HD.  I love the convenience and the computer interface for the Flip, and because of its size I tend to use it much more than the Sanyo.  They Sanyo certainly has many more features for a little more money, so which one you would buy depends on your situation.

If you often shoot video at the last minute, and are less concerned about quality (though for its size the Flip looks great) than you are about ""capturing the moment"" - I would buy the Flip. You can literally stuff it in a shirt pocket or your glove box and it is there if you need it. Ditto if you want a really simple interface and an easy to use camera.

If you instead want to create some better home videos, and a little bigger camera with more features is appealing, then buy the Sanyo.",3.0,0

"The bracelet from Cat Eye Jewels is a stunning. Elegant is actually the word I used in the review title, and that fits too. So does beautiful. I received the ""March"" version of this piece, which includes a aquamarine colored stone beads along the bracelet and also one that dangles from the center setting. It really looks and feels fantastic in person.

I like the bracelet that we received and would recommend this to anyone looking for unique, interesting and fun jewelry. The 10mm stone beads sit around somewhat elastic monofilament that has some give to it, making it easy to slide this bracelet on & off over my wrist.

When laid flat on the table, the unstretched bracelet measures about 4 inches across (or 8 inches in total length) and it was an easy stretch to about 4.5 inches (9 inches total length). This bracelet weighs in at about 1.2 ounces per our postal scale, so it looks and feels beautiful and classy.

I lightly buffed the stones and small silver portions with a soft microfiber cloth, and it gave the bracelet a very nice sheen to it. The silver and aquamarine colors look unbelievably great together; I think that this has become my favorite now.

There was no mention of a warranty that I found, so if an unexpected issue occurs within a reasonable period of time I would return to update the review and let you know what the issue was and how resolution was handled. I received this beautiful bracelet gratis from the seller and wore it to see how it looks and feels. My statements here reflect that testing and his sentiment.

If you are looking for a beautiful, elegant bracelet of this quality, construction, price, size and style, then I would highly recommend giving this piece from Cat Eye Jewels a try based on my experience with it.

Very recommended.

"Before purchasing I was a little leary, both of the bright room concerns voiced earlier and of buying from an Amazon associated company, not Amazon itself.  Purchasing a month ago, both fears were unfounded.

Electronic Express was fine, shipping on Monday after a Friday order via FedEx Ground.  The box was strapped vertically to a pallet and the driver helped removing it from the pallet and using a hydraulic platform to get it to the ground and into the house.  Net result:  no shipping nor delivery problems.  The set worked perfectly upon arrival.

As to the picture and operations, I have it on an HDMI connection from a DirecTV HD satellite connection.  The black level is as astonishing as they advertise and the picture as clean and crisp as I observed earlier (at a Sears where they had this, the Sharp and the Sony side-by-side, with the Samsung as good as the Sony and much better than the Sharp).

We are in Florida, where the sun is known to be particularly bright and this room has huge western sky facing windows.  There is a little sun glare and reflection in the very late afternoon but all parts of the screen are still easily viewable and after a few minutes any annoyance from glare and reflection is tuned out by one's eyes.  In sort, there's no problem here with the issue.

Highly recommended for the price and overall quality.

Addendum (December 2009):  Well, a month after the warranty expired, so did this product.  I had an authorized Samsung repair shop look at it and the LCD drivers had failed.  Great, I thought, a simple circuit board change.  WRONG!  That circuit board was ""married"" to the display so the entire display needed to be replaced.  $1500 plus labor!  Short result:  the Samsung was junked and a reliable Sony replacement purchased.  Star rating reflects the unconscionable cost of repair of a somewhat simple problem.",1.0,0

"If you love strategy games, I can't recommend this game enough. It's the U.S. versus Russia during the Cold War and you can feel the tension as each side tries to control countries around the world. You get to live through most of the major events of that time period because they are actually played out in the game.

I'm not sure the word ""fun"" would best describe this game - you are certainly not laughing your way to victory with a wacky group of friends. But if your idea of ""fun"" is deep strategy, constant awareness of how each new event changes the world's politics- and therefore your alliance and chance of winning, and tough decision making, then you will LOVE this game!
I would say the learning curve is moderate as there are a lot of things to keep track of, but once you get a few plays in, things are smooth sailing.

"I upgraded my Denon 2809CI for the SR5008.  The SR5008 chassis size is not as deep so it doesn't take up as much space on the shelf.  Since this is the bedroom I have a simple two channel setup with Axiom M60 floorstanding speakers and HSU Research STF-2 subwoofer.  I like the attention to detail such as the little vibration absorbing material (looks like Sorbothane soft rubber) on the feet to protect the electronics from the nearby subwoofer.

Previously I could not use Audessy with the older Denon because of the simple speaker setup.  Now with the Marantz SR5008 I was able to fly through the Audessy measurements and the sound difference is NIGHT AND DAY!  With the Audessy calibrated stereo setup, the sound is 3-dimensional and super clear.  I'm also selected the bi-amp option for the front speakers just to try it out (not sure if that makes a difference, but it's cool to have the option to put those extra Watts to use).  I would describe it as having a ""warm"" sound which I love.  I used to be a musician and I can distinguish subtle differences in sound quality.

The on-screen menu is very simple and easy to navigate.  When streaming Pandora Internet Radio, the song name and play timer is displayed on the Marantz portal window so I can still see the song name while the TV is turned off.  Some review on the web mentioned the lack of WiFi, but I think it would be silly to integrate WiFi into a high end AVR receiver because WiFi technology is changing so fast (802.11G, N, AC, etc. will be obsolete well before the receiver is outdated).  Simply get a tiny WiFi adapter such as the Netgear WNCE2001 or WNCE3001, plug it in and you're set for wireless as well.",5.0,0

"Schleich's North America Giant Volcano with T-Rex Playset is a beautiful piece of art and very instructional toy. It's immaculately detailed and textures are exquisite, especially on the dino's. There are so many details to point out and explain to your little one as you play together and I'm surprised by how much my little 5 year old loved this set. The bones were especially cool to see.
That said, Schleich's Giant Volcano Playset is a vinyl monstrosity that is a chore to put together very cumbersome to store anywhere. The material is soft vinyl and just weighs a ton. It came in 5 or 6 pieces and held together by these tiny brittle pegs that was an utter nightmare to assemble. Just a very poor design choice of material. Definitely bad if your little one is prone to throw things - each of the pieces from this set is hefty and will cause some damage. many of the highlighted features don't work too well or was embarrassingly underwhelming - ie: the ""exploding wall"" the wall pieces had to be assembled into the nook and pressing the button pushes the pieces over - kind of. The flaw here is that the pieces are so heavy, the notch of plastic that knocks over the wall can barely budge the pieces and they pretty much just slide down. The tree snaps just hasn't worked yet. The roots don't stay agape and the spring snap doesn't really do much. About the only thing that does work is the Dino jail gate and even that contraption seems over engineered.
Flaws aside, the set is very beautiful but alarmingly over priced at almost a hundred dollars. Ouch! I get it - it's vinyl and hefty and very detailed - almost like a model kit but $100 is just too much for such badly engineered play. However, it is great if you're a Schleich fan.",4.0,0

"These trains arrived promptly all in a tiny see thru plastic zip top bag. They are slightly larger than the trains that came with my Mexican train domino set, but just barely.

"I walk on a treadmill for exercise & wear an orthotic insert. The size shoe that accommodates the insert is loose & slips around on my foot while exercising. I have come up with a variety of techniques to compensate: multiple shoe laces, moleskin padding. A thick sock is essential. I ordered 2 pair Thorlos Women's Thick Cushion Distance Walking Quarter Socks April 14, 2010 @ $12.59 a pair, free shipping form Footsmart w/ $25 purchase. The socks were indeed very thick and worked well protecting my foot from pressure & sliding. I ordered 2 new pair Nov 19, 2010, same item, same price, same shipping deal, but not the same sock. These are significantly thinner, when I opened the package the difference was evident. I thought perhaps the original socks had shrunk in length in the wash producing the thicker cushion. However when I tried them on the length was already snug so that hope died and subsequent washing did not affect the cushion. The socks are not bad socks but I would never have invested another $25 if this is what I had rec'd the first time.
 Bottom line: if you are looking for the sock you purchased before: this isn't it. If you are looking for a very thick, cushiony sock: this isn't it.

Additional comment, 3/26/2011. I retained the packaging from my later order hoping to compare to the previous order & get a clue to the change. These socks were 'small.' This accounts for the smaller overall size but not for the change in padding. This is another example of inconsistencies from merchant to merchant & product to product. Most pages for socks have a selection for size on the page. Here there were different pages. My search for style & brand took me to this product as the size I ordered previously is no longer available on Amazon.",3.0,0
"Don't get this if your goal is the secondary temperature gauge.  It doesn't transmit through walls!

There are tons of restrictions about the placement which make the secondary temperature gauge virtually useless.  Who has the PERFECT spot to mount it in relation to the main device?  I thought you could mount the temperature gauge anywhere outside but you can not.  Can't be in the sun, can't get wet, can't have X number of walls or barriers between the main unit and the other gauge.  I actually should have sent it back.

"This was my first purchase of anything in the ATACS FG pattern and I must say I am very happy with the pattern.

The boonie looks well made out of very good quality made materiel, There are some slight assembly/sewing discrepancies if you look for them but nothing that would affect performance or concealment.

The outer ""utility"" band (the band you stick extra foliage) is made from shiny OD green nylon webbing, which detracts somewhat from the very flat, subdued pattern of the rest of the hat. I wish they could have used flat tan cotton webbing on it, or just doubled over some of the ripstop material that the rest of the hat is made from. It kind of sticks out on it in my own opinion. Not a big issue though, and the only thing I would change about it.

NOTE TO MILITARY PERSONNEL: This hat does NOT meet NIR Specs (Near Infrared Signature Management Technology)

Overall this is a very good buy for the money and I am well pleased with the purchase.

As far as sizing goes I have an old GI tan boonie made by propper that I've worn for years now and has been washed multiple times. It is a size a 7.25 (or 7 1/4) and right now it fits my head like a rubber band, even with only small amount of hair on my head. I considered also getting this boonie in 7.25 as well but chose 7.5 instead. I'm glad I did, 7.5 fits loose on my head but still tight enough to be comfortable. After a couple trips through the washer it will still be comfortable. Some good advice that propper put on the label is:

"This is my second Stuhrling watch.  I also own a women's original, which looks a bit more rich.  This model looks good with the advantage that the blue hands make it much more functional. The color provides a contrast making it much easier to read the time than on my original.  This model comes with two bands, one black, one brown.  Since my original came with black, I had my husband change the band to the brown.  No special tools were necessary, though it was a little tricky to line up the holes, so I don't think it would be convenient to change the band often.  Stuhrling watches keep very good time with the advantage of not having to change batteries.  You do have to set the time if you haven't worn it in a few days, but the auto wind feature works great and the ability to see the working mechanism from the front and back of the watch is cool.",5.0,0

"I have never owned a pair of non-sandal Birkenstocks, so it took a little bit to get used to the ""hard"" contoured sole enclosed in boot form. The sole is hard but contoured with more than adequate arch support, however if you aren't used to the molded Birkenstock footbed, I would avoid these boots as they are not the best for a lot of walking. The shearling lining is very soft and very warm, however the top of the boot is floppy so a little bit of that harsh winter breeze sneaks in at the ankles. Overall the boot looks good on, and the opening is wide enough for socks and skinny jeans.

"These bags are much larger than I expected them to be.  It's been a while since I've purchased some, but I don't recall them being so big. They do the job! Makes picking up the pup's messes a lot easier, and a whole lot more sanitary. Especially for my elderly father.  He has a time trying to pick it up with toilet paper without getting it on him or something else.....these are a MUST HAVE item in my house since he's living with me. This will also save money on toilet paper.  My pup is trained to use the potty pad inside, and also to go outside. He's a pomeranian, and I trained him this way so that when it rains or snows, he will be able to go indoors. It's been so nice to not have to get all bundled up in the winter and brave the cold, snow and ice. They've already come in handy, and will last a long time. I know who to get them from now when we run out. The container to keep them in is small, and easy to clip to a belt loop or leash, and am able to grab one easily. The bags are also a good thickness. Some I've purchased in the past were a little thinner than these. If you have a pooch you need to pick up after, these are great to have on hand. They do have a slight odor, but I think it's just the plastic itself. It's not terrible, but is noticeable upon opening the box. They aren't scented with perfume, thank goodness!

They look very sharp!  I wear them with or without socks, with pants, with jeans, with shorts.  I live in NYC and walk everywhere, and these shoes are just so comfortable.

I have flat feet, so I can't wear shoes which have a pronounced hump in the insole.  The insole of these shoes is nice and flat, which I love, but you may not like that.

The grip is nice, too; I walked on some spilled water on a tile floor and didn't feel any slippage.

I plan on buying another pair in a different color to back these ones up.  The only thing stopping a 5-star review is that there are some rough edges on the inside, which can make them uncomfortable when wearing sock-less.  However, I'm finding those rough edges are smoothing out the more I wear the shoes, so we'll see!

"This is a great coloring case.  It has a crayon set, a colored pencil set, and two sets of markers - pip squeak sized small markers and regular size.  As other reviews have noted, it costs about the same as it would to buy all the included crayons, pencils, and markers separately at full price.  The separates will go on sale, and so will this case.

Crayola is good quality.  The products are not light fast, so over time, pics left in windows or bright light will fade.  Colors are bright and markers last longer than dollar store products.  Crayons are the best, since many other brands are waxy and weak.  This set has washable markers, but not the washable crayons or pencils.  So, needs supervision for small children who might write on the wall.  Crayons are made in the US; pencils made in Brazil; case and markers made in Vietnam.

The carrying case has plastic shells glued to the inside that hold the crayons, pencils, and markers.  It looks all neat and tidy, and the latches hold it closed fine for carrying around.  I have not yet lost markers, but since I got this to share with a two year old, some marker tips have been damaged.  Sets drive me nuts when I start missing pieces, but that's the nature of sets.  The plastic shell on this one won't come out, which is good for a full set, because I much sturdier, but means I can't gut it easily later.  The carrying case has a minion with teddy bear on one side and a minion playing a guitar on the other.

"I bought these as a replacement for an older pair of Sony earbuds. I don't know if this pair will eventually present the same problem, but my experience with Sony earbuds has been very mediocre.  First the good.  The sound is decent, though nothing special, and the fit is pretty good.  They are very comfortable and don't fall out, even when I'm jogging and sweaty.  My issue with Sony earbuds is that (with every pair I've owned over the last 10 years) the sound in one ear eventually goes out, never to return.  Then they're garbage.  My friends have all reported having the same problem and none of us has been able to figure out what causes this problem.  It does not appear to be something you can control by treating the earburs with special care of any sort.  I personally believe that Sony designs them to die on you, so that you'll constantly have to keep spending another $20 to replace them.  For my next pair (when these inevitably meet their one eared fate), I'm thinking of going higher end for a pair of earbuds that will last.

"The 2 gig version of this HD 6450 was only $10 more than the 1 gig version. A deal! I do not game, so I have no need for a super OC card. I do use CPU hogging music software and I just want a graphics card that can stay of the busses as much as possible and run without any CPU support. Also, a fan is a big no-no.

There was some driver problems with the Fuel. Service.exe file, which seems to be used only when the card is in Turbo-mode. I turned off the Turbo and stopped the Fuel file from running with MSConfig and that seemed to work. I just installed newly available Catalyst driver/software. Will see what happens next... I haven't had to turn off the Fuel ... yet.

AMD's software is very well conceived and easy to use, with one exception: I am using the HDMI port at times for viewing HULU on my LCD-TV as well as dual displays. There was adequate info on how to set up a dual display system, but absolutely nothing on how to use the HDMI port. Clue: Detect the HDMI first, then set up a preset. After you get all this figured out, you will see the beauty of having many presets to suit any need. The software is quite versatile. Just run the software, select a preset, and voila! New and varied display/graphics setups with different characteristics and functions to suit your software needs.

My last card was an NVIDIA based PNY. It was defective, registered, under warranty, and PNY did not want to give me a new card without my sending them the defective one first, meaning BIG downtime for me (shame on them... I'll never buy another PNY product again). I bought this XFX 6450 instead and I am glad I did. It is without question a much better card. Well worth the $$ !! Buy one!!",5.0,0

We have multiple iPads with different movies and TV shows on each.  With the iPad storage limitations I had to pick and choose periodically to remove and add movies.  With the Seagate Wireless everyone can watch whatever they want.  I copied almost our entire DVD collection as well as our iTune movies to the Seagate and now there's never a shortage of something to watch.  I have a 6 year old daughter and entertainment on the go is a must.  We also connect the iPad to our T&C van and watch movies stored on the Seagate on the car DVD screen.  The picture is not as crystal clear as when a DVD is playing but we're willing to sacrifice a little clarity.  We recently went on a short (maybe 1.5 hour trip) with 5 kids in the car ranging in age and this was a life saver.  The kids could hear and see the movie perfectly.

"This took my cat less than a day to figure out. So that is good. But the design is not 100% perfect. I'm glad the base is more stable than the first Catit Food Tree. But still, it could have a bit more weight to be more bottom heavy.
The problem I quickly noticed is that kibble pieces can become trapped in places, and a cat can't get them out. I've attached pictures. Pictures #1 and #2 show where kibble pieces get stuck. If you have a declawed cat, there is no way they can get those pieces. A cat with claws will even have trouble. A human has to stick their fingers in and dislodge the kibble pieces.
Picture #3 shows a kibble piece that perfectly fits inside the little circle that says 1, 2, or 3. (letting you know the degree of difficulty on the rotating disc). That kibble piece is also stuck, and a human has to dislodge it. You don't need a little circle that says 1, 2, or 3. Food gets stuck there.
These areas where kibble can get stuck, will be frustrating to a cat who is trying to get it.

I have also discovered that the middle level with the rotating disk does not lock in place. If I set it to 3 (the hardest setting with the smallest holes) my cat can EASILY rotate it to level 1 (the easiest setting with the biggest holes). What is the point of having different settings to make the puzzle easier or harder, if it does not lock in place?

But everything considered,  I guess I do like Catit Senses 2.0 Food Tree, and my cat is doing well with it so far.
I am hoping they make a 3.0 version with a  heavier base and no areas where kibble pieces can get stuck.",4.0,0

So, this is just another form of rawhide that is from cows as opposed to just any animal with a cleft hoof.  The Healthy hide rawhide has some extra potato starch, salt, soybean oil, vitamin E (100 IU), and preservatives.  The Healthy Hide sticks have almost ZERO SMELL.

"I wanted a compact rain shell for traveling; it is better to pack layers instead of carrying a big coat. This rain jacket is impenetrable to water when I run a sleeve under water, and it is completely dry afterwards. I have not used it in the rain yet.

I bought the jacket ""big"" so it could be a shell and I could layer underneath it (with a packable down coat, fleece, and/or hoodie). On its own, the jacket looks comfortable and cut nicely, but not big. I am 5'6"" 105 lbs and bought size medium for growing room (I like jackets loose anyway), but it already looks great as it is.

This jacket has features I did not expect, including elastic around the bottom hem (length comes to mid pelvis) and the around the hood for cinching. There is a mesh flap in the back for breathability. These are great features. I noticed the hood is not oversized at all. Cinched up, I think I could probably keep my face dry.

The tag on my jacket said it was $60, but I got it for less than $28; love the Amazon price! It also says it packs into itself, but I cannot figure out how to do this. I rolled it up and am using hair bands.

I dropped the rating because the color represented is not the color I received, even though I like it. ""Bright rose,"" instead of being a dark magenta as is shown, is just darker than hot pink. I'm not picky about my pinks though, so I'll wear it. This color would be cheerful on a wet day, but it will stand out in a crowd.

"I have an anxious dog.  His anxiety is not such that my Veterinarian has recommended ""serious"" drugs for management, but I do like to try out the over-the-counter offerings like this one with him.

The big downside of this nutraceutical is palatability... neither of my dogs liked the taste and would ""eat around it"" when it was in their food.  I could easily ""pill"" them with it, but that's a hassle and I don't think it's particularly helpful to force things on an already anxious dog.  They would not eat it even when it was combined with peanut butter or had cheese wrapped around.  They are, admittedly, kind of picky, but that made this product unsuitable for us.

The ingredients are
Active Ingredients (Per Tablet)
Chamomile - 150mg
Passionflower Powder - 100mg
GABA (Gamma Amino Butyric Acid) - 100mg
L-Theanine - 50mg
L-Tryptophan - 33mg
Thiamine (Mononitrate) - 4mg
Ginger Root Powder - 2.5mg
Inactive Ingredients Beef flavor, brewers yeast powder, liver powder, magnesium stearate, cellulose, silicon dioxide, stearic acid, thiamine mononitrate.

These are interesting and not ones I have seen combined before.  Theoretically, the L-tryptophan and L-theanine, in particular, could have calming effects, although the research jury is still out on everything from dose to actual efficacy.  I do think this comes under the heading of ""mostly harmless,"" although you should always check with your Vet about anything with which you plan to attempt to treat your pet long term.

This is certainly affordable, compared to a few of the other popular over-the-counter remedies.  Be aware that it is very common for it to take 6 weeks or longer before you see effects from any nutraceutical.  Cautions on this product indicate that it hasn't been proven safe for pregnant or lactating bitches, and that it should be discontinued 5 days before any general anesthesia is administered.",3.0,0

In the photo, I really liked the wide strap, but it seemed bulky for me at the ankle and less dressy than I thought they'd be when I tried them on. In the end, I preferred the narrower strap and the width of the clog style Marcella Dansko and chose a 40 rather than a 39. (I have 4 pairs of Danskos which have lasted for 10 years and when you try them on in a store there is slight size and width variation even within the 39's because they are individually made, so on-line, maybe it is always best to size up if you are between sizes.",3.0,0

Ever need to use your computer and not sit in front of it?  I do all the time.  I use my computer to learn the guitar so having to scoot over to my computer just to hit a space bar or some-such is a pain in the behind.  I thought this would be something to try and see if it helped.  It sure has.  Being able to use my mouse from across the room is a godsend. Once i got used to the motions of it it was second nature to click on whatever I needed. Really useful for me.  If I was in an office setting where I had to give frequent presentations this would be great.  Really nice product. I was really impressed with how well it worked. The only wish I had with this product was to have a little more documentation.  The only help info is on the box and that doesn't cover much.  I was able to figure it out but it would be nice to have a bit more. I did get a disocunt on this product but that did not affect my view on it.  I really think this is a nice air mouse.,5.0,0
"WOW there are a million pieces to this set! Once we got everything punched out and sorted we could begin to build. The instructions were easy to follow and the pictures really helped. Sorting through the pieces was challenging but part of the fun. We built one ogre based on the instructions and found the pieces to be very easy to work with. The pieces are very cleanly cut and fit together well. They are soft but sturdy and will hold up to many robot builds. We went on to free build and found that to be really fun also. The possibilities are really endless with this set and I can see even teenagers enjoying building and creating different designs. Once the ogres and creatures are built you can display them or disassemble them to play another day. Fully assembled the largest ogre is about a foot tall. They store well in the box, but we opted to separate the pieces into baggies for cleaner storage. A very nice set!",5.0,0

"This is our 2nd time buying this litter. We have 2 cats and 2 litter boxes. This litter helps to keep the cat urine smell away and reduces cleaning  time significantly. The urine does not clump so you simply swish through it with the litter scoop and it blends away. I also notice that solids seem to dry up more in this litter. Litter box smells are something that I was constantly battling since I am always worried when guests come over, especially since 1 box is in the guest bathroom. Our screened in porch always had a faint cat urine smell because our 2nd box is out there and the cat with the strongest odor uses that one. After using only this litter for over a month, there isn't an odor anywhere anymore.

I am able to fill up each litter box and the litter lasts for about 4 weeks before needing changed. You can tell by the urine not swishing away as normal and starts to get tiny clumps in it. Even then, it doesn't leave a strong urine smell.

I honestly wouldn't use another litter as long as I can help it. The ONLY thing I do not like about this litter is that is has a ton of dust when filling up the litter boxes and a little when swishing through it. Because of this, I usually fill it up outside. Highly recommend this litter, especially for multiple cats!",5.0,0
So I gave three but I wanted to give two stars. This is very expensive first off to not be a great product. Now the sizing I would def size up if you don't like it to be so tight. As the day goes on it becomes irritating. Because it's tight. Now I am a large and I started wearing it 3 weeks after my pregnancy. Which I had lost most of my weight. I had two kids back to back: I am 5.1 tall and weigh post pregnancy 150. Pregnancy I was 191! So actually I was more of xl but I got large. Anyhow it def fits snug. But the top of it does roll down and I read other reviews and hoped it didn't but guess what it rolls down. I find asking my husband to pull it up. Then being large chest I find it hard to snap everything together. So if you have that issue get something easier to pull up. I had c-section. Which this didn't make it that comfortable near the incision. It does give support for my back. I don't wear it much maybe if it was softer and comfortable I would! Really if you read this review try others that are cheaper. The hospital gave me a wrap to help but it wasn't that great but it def much better than this! I will post pic later. Oh it also squeeze my back fat and made it worse! Very disappointed overall and the return policy sucks cause you have to keep the tags on it. Heck you should be able to return in 30 days regardless. It even made me feel tummy aches. It will flatten you stomach while wearing it though only good thing really but it's not by much. You just gotta really work out and eat well!

"I bought this Women's V Neck Short Sleeve Lace Mesh Inset Open Back Casual Plus Size Top in caramel, I thought on the screen it was a lovely neutral color and I still think so after receiving it. I will say right away that I am plus sized and these run small. I bought a 3X and unfortunately its like its painted on me instead of a little loose. Knowing that though, if you're thinner than me, or a different shape (I am an apple) I would buy at least a size up. I will say though I tested this just like any other clothing I get to test and review in exchange for my honest unbiased feedback. I don't hand wash. Anything. Ever. Thats what washing machines are for. Mine has a hand wash setting, so I decided to try putting the shirt in on that setting. I have used it for many hand wash only items before with no problem. Same thing this time. The shirt came through the wash and tumble dry on medium heat just fine. I would always recommend following the label instructions, but if you're lazy like me and want to try a machine, youd probably be ok. Even though I won't be wearing this shirt until I hopefully lose some weight, I do think its a lovely fabric, color and style. I found it very soft and quite comfy, albeit too tight for my liking.

"This is very light for a Feld game.  I've played other light Feld games such as Builder's Duel and The Speicherstadt but for the most part his games tend to be meatier/deeper experiences.

In this game players draw 3 cards each turn.  Each card has 3 possible uses and players determine which card is going to be used for each of the three functions that turn.  One will be used to give the player a special ability, the other to get a resource, and the last to move an animal track marker up.  In between the second and last action players also put an explorer on a board in order to surround and collect animal tiles.  These tiles are the main source of points in the game.  The game lasts until the animal track markers are at a certain level and the player with the most points wins.

I typically really like the mechanic of cards being used for multiple different purposes and having to choose which role to fit each of your 3 cards in each turn presents a lot of opportunity cost decisions that make this game, despite being reasonably light, also reasonably deep and engaging.  There's a little bit of competition and reading your opponents as everyone is playing in the same space and especially with more players there can be competition for certain aspects of the game.  That said, the game is a lot more interesting with more players.  It is fine with 2, but each player can tend to focus on their own thing and there is less interaction.

The accessibility is a great boon for this game, this is a game that is quick to get up and running with almost anybody and because it is still reasonably engaging and deep you don't sacrifice that in making a lighter game.",4.0,0
"I bought this mouse for use with my Surface 3.

Do not buy this if you are an advanced player that's looking for cards to use for tournament play.  Many of the cards are not tournament legal.  I personally like it better because I like to collect some of the older cards for their artwork. Some old cards date back to Ice Age (1995), 5th edition (1997) etc and range to the new ones like M11 and Scars of Mirrodin (2011).

I like to recommend this but remember you don't know what you are actually getting. They are mostly commons and some cards are old and a few are not in the best condition.

"I love every single thing about the Race to the Treasure game.  I love that the instructions are printed on the inside of the box so you can never lose the instructions.  (If you happen to lose the box all of the instructions are located on their website)  I love that all the pieces come in a reusable pouch, not those plastic bags that get thrown away.  I love that all of the materials are all recycled but all have a very high quality feel.  Most of all, I love the sheer genius that is a cooperative game.

Sure, it is important for kids to know what it feels like to win and to lose, and we still play games like Monopoly Junior where there is a clear winner but when there is too much ""I WIN I WIN"" going on in the house I pull out Peaceable Kingdom's Race to the Treasure or Hoot Owl Hoot.  Cooperative games require all players to work together as a team to win.  At first I thought there was no way my 5 year old would fall for this, he is competitive and loves to chant ""I WIN I WIN"".  Much to my surprise, he loves all of the Peaceable Kingdom games we have played.  My 5 year old son loves to help his 3 year old brother because it ultimately helps them both ""win"" the game.  And two winners is always better than one, right?

Race to the Treasure is my favorite Peaceable Kingdom game.  The goal is to create a path to pick up three keys and get to the finish before the ogre gets you.  The game requires some thinking and strategy of how you'll pick up the keys and get to the finish but most importantly, it requires the players to work together to decide which path is the best way.  It's pretty amazing to see kids working together for a common goal rather than plotting against one another for the glory.",5.0,0

"Note - I was provided this product for review. I don't know that I was prepared to like this leash as much as I do. It's a solid, well made leash and I *never* feel as though I am not in control of the animal. I've been using this for my 90 lb Lab, and while he can be a tad rambunctious on the leash (particularly when the squirrels are out), this leash makes control pretty easy. I think my favorite part is the elastic-type that allows the dog to feel graduated tension before the leash becomes taut. I actually found my dog slowing down of his own accord when the leash started tightening up. Then there's what I think of as the short-hold-handle, that spares me from having to wrap the leash around my hands if I want to shorten the lead for whatever reason. In sum, this is a really good leash. I found the clasp to be a little sticky, but some WD-40 took care of it and it works well. I don't have any qualms about using this leash.",5.0,0

"I like this because it is small and ergonomically well designed.  I am keeping it.  However, there are many tradeoffs and issues that anyone should note:

1.  The movie function is better in quality than stills for almost all conditions.

2.  The movie function sound picks up faint noise from absolutely everything the camera does, from zoom to auto adjust the focus.  This can only be heard under quiet conditions, but it is there, and in fact mentioned in the manual.

3.  The low light still is very poor, except if it is pitch dark and you set it for that condition.  I find taking pictures indoors without the flash superior than with it on.

4.  The camera is very sensitive to shakes during still...and the image stabalizer only works for movies.  This really needs a good image stabalizer for stills, since slight motion ruins the image, particularly in zoom.

5.  It is true you can take a still while recording a movie.  However, what is not mentioned, is that the movie is interrupted during the capture and that sounds of shutter clicking at quite high level invade the audio

I love the camera for convenience and remarkable capability.

From other reviews, the new HD version solves none of the issues I mention.

"This is the first smart watch I've used, but I have been interested in trying one for a while now.  After using one I have mixed opinions on how useful it really is.

The first thing that struck me is that this thing is huge!  I've seen people wearing Apple watches, this is several times bigger and bulkier.  It came with a completely drained battery, which you have to partially charge to set it up.  The partial charge took 20-30 minutes.  My opinion is mixed on the charger.  It's handy not to have to plug a wire into the watch, as it's magnetic.  On the down side the watch has to be laid out flat to charge, so it takes up quite a bit of room.

Installing Android wear on my phone was easy enough.  The Michael Kors site did not work on my phone, but did work on my tablet.  I downloaded a few applications from Android to change the watch face, and check the weather.  It was fun to play with the different faces, there are a wide variety available for free.  The weather apps are also very useful.

The notifications are pretty cool, but are one of the reasons I question the usefulness.  So little text fits on the screen that I ended up going to my phone to read everything.  Similarly, setting up Google maps on the phone and then navigating from the watch is really only useful if walking, and I'd still rather see a larger map on my phone.  The Google translate is kind of cool, I've tried that out a couple of times converting to Russian and it works pretty well.

All in all I think this is kind of a niche product.  The size limits the market even more, as it's huge.",4.0,0

"If your using Tidy Cat your not using the best.  We where faithful Tidy Cat purchasers for over 10 years then after taking up our carpets to go back to the hardwood underneath we where shocked by how much litter was in and under the carpet, yes we vacuum.
Within a week of having hardwood floors again we where shocked how much litter was all over the house, not to mention in the bed - ughh.  Also we found that Tidy Cat wasn't clumping as well as it use to and we were always fishing out tiny clumps too.
Well it was time to do something about the mess so we decided to try a different litter.  WOW if you have never used Cat's Pride Fresh and Light litter you have to try it!  Tidy Cat is like little balls, Cat's Pride is not.  Cat's Pride is a very light litter which is a big plus, no strong scent and clumps great!  We have 2 covered litter boxes side by side one still with Tidy and one with Cat's Pride. I put a 4' x 5' piece of astro truf (outdoor type) in front of the boxes and still have to sweep Tidy off the hardwood in that room, hallway and adjoining rooms but no Cat's Pride.

"Purchased this for my adopted puppy. He was 10 months old, and over 90lbs when we got him. He came from a neglectful home, had never walked on a leash and was not trained at all. He pulls a lot on the leash, and is a jumper. A regular collar and leash was not cutting it. The only attention he got at home before was when he jumped up on his owners, which he did to us, then got him over excited and he began to mouth and nip. At almost 100lbs, this normal puppy behavior did a lot of damage.
This product is well constructed, and good quality. It comes with an instructional DVD as well. However, I followed the DVD, and eased him into sizing and wearing this, gave him lots of love and treats during the whole process. He seemed fine with it and I tried having him wear it for a couple seconds at a time and went from there. He didn't seem to have a problem wearing it. However, when it came to actually using with a leash, my dog simply would not have it. He would struggle and/or flop to the floor and not move, and he always found a way out of the nose piece, even though it fit the way the video said it should. My dog is very stubborn and the most I could ever get him to walk on this was one lap around the living room. I wish this had worked for us, but it just wasn't a good fit for us. We bought the ""Easy Walk Dog Harness"" by the same brand at the same time, thinking we'd start with this one and work our way up to just the regular harness.

"In the age of digital revolution that metamorphosed photography for ever there is little reason to buy an analog product. A product with a large size and cumbersome function. rather than take hundreds of photos before you think of changing your memory card you are limited to 10 small expensive prints.
So why did I buy it. And how come did I give it five stars. Will here are the reasons;
1. I had realistic expectations for what I was getting into.
2. I love photography in all it's shapes and forms.
3. Again I had realistic expectation.
4. I'm into fun stuff
5. I'm sentimental for the old days.
look at reasons 1 and 3 again. some people buy things with inflated expectations and then get disappointed with what they have.
Honestly the photo quality was way way much better than I expected. The colors are vivid and vibrant and the focus is really sharp. The camera has for simple different settings for light conditions and an automatic flash which did a really good job for foreground lighting. The photos are small but that was a compromise I'm willing to make. They are expensive $1 per print, to me that makes them more precious.
In this day of digital we are so used to click click click with our digital cameras and our cellphones. We take thousands of photos and print literally zeros. The photos we take are free so we don't think twice of click click click. With this Polaroid and $1 per print price tag I enjoyed the click and the ""Shake it like a Polaroid picture"" and the sharing with others. It is really really fun.
But I have no illusions. And I want you to have none. This is a novelty / speciality item. It will not replace my DSLR or my point and shooter it will compliment them and thus I'm really happy with my purchase and if you buy this camera with a realistic expectations and if you are a sentimental guy/gal you will enjoy it like I am.",5.0,0

"This turned out to be a great deal, even though the bracelets are not really sized for a small wrist (I have experimented with other uses as an armband or anklet, with varying results). The larger ones are very thick but the design (on all four, actually) is visually attractive. They come individually wrapped but all packaged in one bag. The cord binding them is not stiff, so even though it only moves on one side, the loose ends hang down nicely rather than getting in the way of things.",5.0,0
"Ok so I just got these and they fit really well (In my opinion). Im a womens size 7 1/2 and I got in a mens 6. These are the Rewinds and the seller says that they are in men sizes only.

When I first got the skates I had a hard time turning corners but after loosening the axle a bit I still have trouble but its probably just because I need to practise.

The wheels are harder than I expected and not for rough surfaces like roads (though Im sure I read that they could be used outdoors) so I might need to buy softer wheels to do that.

For an affordable skate its good and from the looks of it, it most likely will last me a good while until I can afford the Moxi skates.

So basically size is good & fits good. The only issue right now is the limiting wheels.",4.0,0
"Let me start off with the packaging.
1. It doesn't say ""Plus"" anywhere on it.
2. The information on the back isn't always correct. It says it has a mini-usb for example when it really has a micro-usb.
3. The packaging looks like something you'd get in a airport vending machine. Not very high end at all.

What is more important is the product itself.
1. It's much lighter than expected. It's a good thing for headphones, but it does make it feel unsubstantial. The diameter is about the size of a silver dollar.
2. The shiny black plastic looks like it will damage easy.
3. The logo in the middle looks like it should be a button. It isn't.
4. The front buttons are easy to access, but the volume buttons on the side are harder to feel.
5. The blue light flashes when it's powered on.
6. It stores in a very small spiral that can be like a puzzle to unravel until you get used to it.
7. Overall it is very comfortable and easy to forget you are wearing. Doesn't fall off easily.
8. USB port is covered by a little rubber flap that isn't very reassuring.

Most important is performance.
1. Bass is underwhelming. Sound is on the tiny side.
2. Connection strength is very good. Easy to walk around the house and not lose connection.
3, You can still easily hear the world around you at normal volumes.
4. Battery lasts as long as advertised and charges quickly.
5. You can still hear the trademark ""bluetooth buzz"" when the sound is low.
6. Microphone isn't very good at hearing you. Constantly had to talk louder than I would have with a phone.

Overall I feel like it is a solid product for the price. Will it win awards in... anything? Probably not, but it is still a great value. I feel it would be a five-star product at $30-35, but at $50 it's still a solid option for small, over-ear bluetooth headphones. The main downside is you can find unbranded versions of these headphones for ~$20 on Amazon, still with Prime shipping.",4.0,0

All I do is simply pour the Arm & Hammer litter deodorizer baking soda onto the bottom of the litter box under this bedding and it works great to capture the odor.

"Run small. Buy a size larger. Great buy.......Fantastic comfort. I bought 3 packs, 9 pair. I will buy these forever, if you keep stocking them. I am so hooked on these boxer briefs. It was one of my best buys of 2014. I now have 9 pair, and if had the extra cash. I would buy 9 more pair. I took a chance on these & struck gold..... I am not one to get attached to my underwear, but these are the most comfortable I have owned in all my 63 yrs. of life. If I can, I will replace all my underwear with these. I should have bought more. They fit perfect in the pouch, and the comfort is top shelf for the money. Go ahead, go out and spend $20.00 a pair for underwear. I think that is rediculous  for underwear. After you wash them, they fit even better. Cannot be beaten for the money. Like I said, go a size larger. My extra large are perfect. I am 6'1"" & 210 lbs.

I cannot understand why their are any negative view points on this product. I too, took a chance on these Boxer Briefs, and like I said, I have 9 pair!. These could possibly sell much higher.

Note 1: Apple products use their own rules to decide charging speed. A designed-for-Apple charger may be slow to charge non-Apple devices, and vice versa.

Note 2: Blocking other outlets. Seems like small thing, but it can be a hassle. Unplugging hotel room lamps, alarm clocks, etc. to charge your phone? Just say no (or carry an extension cord).

"I rarely buy bras without trying them on so I took a chance with this one.  I wear a 40c in most bras, including JC Penney Ambrielle.  One review said the cup size ran large, and I thought it was a tiny bit large when I put it on, but I also know that later in the day, when gravity gets working, I will fill those wee bit too big cups!  The band size is true.  I do have it on the end hook (the loosest one) but that's my body, not the bra size.  It says no bounce and it is no bounce.  This is not a bra for a 34A (if they even  make it in that size).  As other reviews have said, it's so comfortable it's a wear all day bra, not just for working out or sports.  I have scar tissue on  my torso from surgery and I have a real problem getting comfortable bras.  I can't wear underwire and usually the band is tight for me.  This one is right on the money.",5.0,0

"I broke down and bought this mat in a fit of desperation because I was sick and tired of the sheer amount of litter and waste my two 4-5 month old kittens were tracking everywhere BUT inside their litter box! At first it worked relatively well, though the indentations are pretty shallow and don't catch everything. But then my kittens took to picking at the mat, which caused the PVC to shred. So then in addition to the usual tracking of litter and waste, there were also little PVC particles everywhere! I am still finding it all over the house.

So for me, this mat did not work well. However, I do want to add the disclaimer that if you have older cats, or just cats who are not interested in picking at the PVC material, this mat might work better for you.",2.0,0

"I am really impressed with the Skyfi3 XM Satellite Radio.  It is lightweight, the right size to fit in you shirt pocket or pants pocket and has the right functionality to serve its purpose.  The sound quality is good with enough volume to overcome most external sounds, in particularly for me, a lawn mower.  Its mobility allows it to be used in your home, car and outside walking or jogging.  You have to purchase the accessories for the home and outside functionality.  I also purchased the home kit since the SKyFi3 comes with a car kit.  I purchased the wireless router in order to transmit the signal from the south side of my house to a location inside my house.  It is absolutely necessary to have clear view of the southern sky in order to receive the satellite signal.  It has worked wonderfully after setting up the antennae outside in a covered plastic container.  The antenna is supposed to be weatherproof but I am not taking any chances.  It took me about 2 hours to read the directions for each device and get everything working.  Even the car installation was very easy and worked once all the parts were connected.  I have had one glitch with the device.  I tried to turn it on one day after not using it for a week and it wouldn't come on.  After much anxiety I read the manual and it explained how to reset the device.  I like most it ability to set up recording schedules for your XM stations.  These can then be sorted by various means to access the recordings.  The device has many functions and for the $26.99 including S&H for the car kit it was well worth it. I highly recommend this device and its accessories.",5.0,0

"I have been a PC user since I was introduced to computers, many years ago. I always wanted to try a Mac computer, but the prices of them always kept me from buying one.

One of them is disdainful towards any kind of scratching post -- but the other has ripped through several of the inexpensive $9 throw-away boxes. In fact there are at least two or three of them spread through the house, not counting the little crunchies left behind from enthusiastic scratching.

When I bought the PetFusion Cat Scratcher Lounge I worried a little bit whether spending this kind of money would be evidence that I've turned into a Cat Lady. Well, maybe I have... but at least I know I did not waste a cent. Because from the first moment that Shaka met this ""lounge"" (as you see in the video) she has claimed it as her own. It's a good thing that the other cat thinks it's ""meh,"" because Shaka would defend this with a temper tantrum.

Yes, it's on the large side. It's probably as big as some people's side coffee tables. That's fine for us because it has becomes the cat's regular perch, and (for a small cat) she stretches out very comfortably. And then she indulges in some dainty ripping-apart-of-cardboard as she scratches to her little heart's delight.

Fortunately as other reviewers have reported, it's constructed very well, with the cardboard FAR more dense than in the cheap scratching boxes you're thinking of. I won't need to replace this for a good long time.",5.0,0

"Normally I feed my cats Fromm Four Star dry foods but I was looking for something a little more budget friendly available with Prime shipping that was still a better brand.

However my cats had different plans - they ALL refuse to eat it. It's been a game of chicken over the last couple of weeks with me refusing to buy any other brand and my cats loudly voicing their displeasure with this food. I finally gave in and bought another brand because I was sure they were plotting my death! I don't know whether it tastes horrible or bland, or if it's the tiny kibble that turns them off.

This is by far the BEST dog toy I have ever invested in.  My 125 lb Rottweiler/Mastiff mix LOVES to play soccer and I was having to buy a soccer ball for him every few weeks because he would deflate it and then shred it to pieces.  This ball has been great for him...he loves this ball even more than soccer balls.  The grooves on it make it so easy for him to catch/fetch & the best part is it's heavy duty foam and will not deflate.  The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because the 1st one I bought only lasted about 4 months of heavy use before the thread/seams started coming apart.  Eventually it broke down and the canvas covering came off exposing the foam and had to be thrown out.  We are now on ball #2 and when this one gets torn up we will get another.  These last so much longer than any other ball I have bought for my rough player.,4.0,0
"These bees are supposed to be replacements for the beehive toy, but these toys are great individually! Last year I bought my dog the chipmunks and the tree stump and wanted to get the chipmunks replacement this year, but they were $3 dollars more than these! If you watch the price it could go down to about $4.50. It's an awesome deal! Dog toys are expensive and these are made so well. My dog loves any thing with a squeaker and even though hes 14 pounds, he destroys every time I've given him except for these Kyjen chipmunk/bees etc. They're a great treat for dogs who love toys and they're economical since they last for a very long time! I definitely recommend them and I will buy them again as soon as they hit the four dollar mark ;)

sad to say, but I have to take down 2 star... these toys are awesome little things that my dog loves to throw in the air and catch, but the squeakers inside are horrible! The squeakers inside last about an hour, but they never squeak again... they're very poorly made. The squeaker inside has two parts and the little thing that makes the squeaker squeak always slides out. Then the squeaker part always gets smashed within an hour that my dog gets bored of it. That's the only problem with this toy which is kind of a big deal since the whole point is for it to squeak! Anyways they are very durable and if you just replace the squeaker, your dog will be able to enjoy this toy for a very long time :)",3.0,0

"I bought this flashlight early december 2015. In recent months I've been using it at work and it has been dropped and tossed around in dusty crawl spaces. I wanted a flashlight that could use my old 18650 batteries that I won't use anymore for my e-cig.

Battery life seems alright. I pretty much always use the light on high and the 18650's i'm using are old and don't last nearly as long as it could with a fresh one. If you're battery is dying it will still allow you to use the low or medium brightness until it can't handle it anymore.

I've had this flashlight fall a few times with some falls taking little chunks of metal off it. I noticed other owners experiencing it not working after a drop. Luckily the one I have took the falls like a champ.

This flashlight is very bright. I'm not a flashlight enthusiast but when climbing into crawl spaces and peering through dark drop tile ceilings it really lights it up. I really like using the zoom feature when looking around. It will illuminate even the furthest darkest corner I would need it to.

Some cons for this light would be it can get hot quick depending on the temperature around you. The zoom markings are pretty silly and I don't think anyone uses it.

Very nice for the money but this cannot hold tight when tilting.  It's like you can't tighten it enough with that knob.

"Let's see...
I received it with the thermal glue already dried up, so I used GE silicone II to mount the extra heatsinks. If you do this, make sure the heatsink stays in place for at least a full day and let the stuff cure before using the card.
The cold plate did not make proper contact with the core on a Gigabyte 390, so that card is now useless, due to a cracked core.
On the plus side, it dropped the temperatures on an overclocked XFX 270X by 30 degrees, so it got temperatures like 30 degrees above ambient while stressed with Furmark. The overclocked 270X this was put on served me well, but it is starting to crash (driver-related blue screen) with any overclock at all. Does anyone know what could be causing this issue?

As it comes it is not much use.  Like others I replaced the sand paper like covering with carpet with double faced tape.  Another negative is that if you are using this in your driveway the thing will slip right off the car unless you are supporting it.  There are no rubber feet or anything to help it grab the surface.  With my 80 pound lab it is very difficult to guide him while holding the ramp in place with my foot. He is finally getting used to it but it has slipped out from under him twice causing him to be very wary of it.  Not sure how to remedy that.  But when it works it is very helpful.

Two side notes:

1) Make sure you look around for a water bottle that is closer to the length of the ""wick"". A normal .9fl oz (500ml) bottle is too tall for the wick to reach the bottom or at least closer to it so you have to fill the bottle up before it gets to  3/4 of the way empty.

2) If you don't use it everyday or even occasionally just from going home from work and coming back, the silver piece (metal diaphragm vibrating at an ultrasonic frequency) at the top of the humidifier gets ""stuck"" and I have to kind of poke at it to get it running or shake the bottle up.

"Denons ear-bud headphones are simple, comfortable to wear, and offer high sound quality.

The Denons are understated, but stylish.  They have polished end caps, with dark chrome accents.  The materials and the fit and finish are high.  Included with the headphones are three silicon ear tips; small, medium, and large.  Also included is a short extension cable, although I am unsure what anyone would need it for.  I never needed it when using the Denons with my iPhone 5s.

The Denons have a small built-in microphone and a single button that is attached a couple of inches down from the right ear-bud.  The button allows you to control music playback and take calls/use voice command.  Its very intuitive and simple to use.

Sound quality of the Denons is high.  I listened to all types of music, from jazz, to country, to pop and all of it sounded nice.  Bass was strong without being overpowering, and high were also nicely rendered.  Overall, I found they produced very balanced and attractive sound.  Since the Denons close off the opening of the ear canal so well I was also able to hear subtle instruments and vocals that I would have missed otherwise.  The one downside of their excellent noise isolation is that I could also hear myself breathing at times.

The Denons are comfortable and I found that the medium sized ear tips fit my average sized ears best.  The headphones fit snuggly, but are never uncomfortable, and even after walking briskly for a mile they only shifted a little bit.  Im not sure they are made for running, but for modest activity levels they should work fine.  They are also light in weight.  The cord is long enough to not tug on the headphones when you move, but not so long that it gets in the way.

All in all you cant ask for much more from ear-buds.",4.0,0

"These rain boots are comfortable and cute. I usually wear a 7.5 or 8 in a regular shoe; I bought these in an 8. With socks on, the foot fits well around the arch, ankle, & heel (my mother, who has very high arches, did not find the arch as comfortable). The toe is roomy, but I like that. The ankle feels likes it's reinforced, so if you try to bend your ankle too much, it might feel weird, but that's true for many boots. If you walk placing one foot in front of the other (like you would if wearing dress shoes or on a runway at a fashion show), then the clips on the interior side of the calves are going to knock into each other and will likely come undone -- other comments have mentioned this problem -- but if you walk with your feet slightly apart, it's not a problem at all. The clips are not so large as to knock into each other if you make just slight adjustment to your foot placement.  After all, they're made for stomping around in rain and mud, not to be worn as dress shoes or at runway shows, even though they are cute enough for that. ;)  Overall, I like them and would recommend them.",5.0,0

If you want a smaller 4/3 camera and are happy with just the LCD (no viewfinder) the Olympus may be a bit better camera.  The G-3 is much much lighter and smaller than my Canon 5D.

My daughter just turned 7 so this game was a little too easy for her, but she still loves it.  This InnoTab game allows children to choose easy or difficult levels.

Behind the doors are the classes where games are played such as matching game, art class and find the missing pieces.

"My four-year-old daughter loves Disney Junior, and while she'll watch Miles from Tomorrowland, it's never been one of her favorites. As a result, this Photon Flyer was our first Miles toy. My daughter apparently recognized the craft from the show and immediately began to play with it.

Although the Miles figure glows and the wings light up, it's actually pretty basic for a toy vehicle these days.  The wings fold back a little for ""surface mode,"" and the nose of the craft can slightly extend for ""hyper speed mode,"" but that's about it. On the one hand, it opens a door for fun and imagination, but I think my youngest was a bit disappointed that it didn't at least make sounds.

Of course, this Photon Flyer works best when combined with other Miles toys that we do not have. It fits into a sold-separately toy called the Stellosphere, which -- according to the box -- ""amps up"" this toy with sounds, more lights, and larger wings. So at the moment, our vehicle is not ""amped up,"" nor do we have accessories (none included) to store in the ship's cute cargo hold. Although my daughter creatively put some Lion Guard stuff in there and promptly added Lion Guard figures to her Miles missions. And finally, the box prominently shows the Merc figure (not included) who has his own custom seat and moon roof in the flyer.

All in all, if you have other Miles toys already, this Photon Flyer is a great addition to any collection. It works great with other figures, accessories, and the Stellosphere set. If, like us, it's all on its own in the Miles universe, you'll likely be encouraged by your child to expand your collection... Unless they want to enlist other friends, like the Lion Guard, in their space adventures.",4.0,0

"""Space saving"" has become a very important feature for us since we bought a motor home.  No matter how big an RV one buys, there is still never enough room.  This duffle bag comes packaged to look just like a laptop sleeve--it folds up that concisely.  It packs away like an over-sized notebook, and I can slip it in just about anywhere without seeming to add any bulk at all.

It is very nice looking, made of tough nylon material.  Stitching is tight and straight.  Zippers are quality and zipper tabs are large enough to grab easily.  It is not a smooth, effortless motion to maneuver the zipper tab around the corners, but it does get around the 90 degree corners without coming out of the track.  There are extra pockets, too, and decent handles.

"We adopted Beast, a 60 lb mutt in early October. He seemed to be great, until he started eating my boyfriends things when we were gone at work. My boyfriend decided to buy a camera so we can see what he's doing when we're gone. Lo and behold the poor guy is so anxious he is howling the whole time we are gone! We had no idea! It wouldn't really bother us, but we live in a small apartment and if too many people complain, we will be forced to get rid of him. We started to try everything, classical music, leaving the tv on, closing the windows, opening the windows, crating him, giving him a frozen bone or kong to distract him, yelling at him over the camera, taking him for a nice long walk before we go, EVERYTHING. nothing worked. We were at our wits end, we had just adopted him and now were at risk for losing him!! This collar was on sale for $20. We bought it. Finally, we left and watched him on the camera. He started to howl and the collar beeped 3 times, and when he didn't stop, it finally zapped him. Yes, it was heartbreaking to hear him yelp, BUT he stopped!! (and it would have been more heartbreaking to give him away). Finally!! He only wears it when we are gone and it's super important to put it on the right way, or else it won't work.
First you have to make sure it's right under his head, not low on the neck where a regular collar would sit, but literally right underneath his head.
Then you have to make sure it's tight to the point where the actual box won't move if the dog scratches/shakes. You should still be able to fit one finger in, but it should be TIGHT.
Then you have to give a good shake before you go, so it's touching the dog's skin, NOT HIS FUR!

"a lot of the reviews say the consistency is too dry, i was a bit hesitant to buy it after reading that... but i went ahead and purchased this type because i was on a budget and its $10 cheaper than the venison and sweet potato pack. received it today and both of my dogs devoured it. i was feeding them chicken soup for the puppy lovers soul wet food mixed with 1/4 cup dry chicken soup dog food (was still using up the puppy cans, both dogs are on to adult food now) and that stuff smelled like canned dog food. nothing special. they ate it and it didn't make them sick... but i wanted something better and preferably grain free. ran out of the wet the other day before making this purchase and substituted with a scoop of pedigree puppy formula wet food and pretty much within 5 minutes after finishing eating my boy was throwing up. scrapped that can. this stuff smells ALMOST like human food, you can see the potato chunks in it, wich i didn't think were too overbearing, my dogs love potatoes so its not a problem anyways. so far, so good. its been about an hour and neither one has puked.

Its proving to be a great learning activity as every time she pulls off a sticker she tells me what it is or asks if she didn't know. It helps them associate what animals belong to which habitat in addition to learning what the habitats themselves are. Our stickers have stuck great though you have to be kind of careful when taking them off and moving them to a new spot as they get bent from finger nails fairly easily.

large hands. It isn't the easiest to focus with, but you become fairly adept at it quickly
enough. The quality seems good and I imagine that I will have this unit around for a long time. I teach firearms indoors and I needed a monocular to help my aging eyes see the. 22 caliber bullet
holes on black targets with dark backgrounds. I can readily see holes out to 20 yards with these
and I am very happy, especially at the pricepoint. I carry them in my jacket pocket for birding
when riding my motorcycle. Hech, I even tried the ant thing and it was impressive that I could
stand above an ant pile and watch them as if I was on my knees, like when I was a kid. I recommend this monocular and I promise you that you will like Carson as a brand, especially if
you have to contact them. I just wish that they would make a nice birding spotting scope. Regards and happy viewing.",5.0,0
"These were pretty good shoes.  I wear an XL in shoes and they fit just fine.  The other pair I had was a little tighter and the heel was a little too loose.  I was concerned about the shoe's durability, but it's not really worth it.  The only reason I gave them 5 stars is because they are very comfortable and they are a little longer than I expected.

"Trixie is a super cute dog.  Like the other Fur Real animals, she's not soft and squishy like a stuffed animal, but hard and mechanical on the inside.  Not a sleep in bed with you kind of toy, the exterior fur is what makes them charming.  Trixies mouth is open so her cute little tongue is showing, which makes her extra authentic appearing.

Trixie arrives in bright purple, pink and blue packaging with a remote control, star glasses and her skateboard.  Even her handkerchief around her neck is purple based delight.  Screams GIRL TOY.  2 AAA batteries and 3 AA batteries are required to make Trixie come to life are NOT included.

She's a little dog, the size of a chihuahua, and light enough for a four year old to carry around.  Younger than that, which is not recommended, may drop and hurt their foot or if they roll onto it bump their head as she's got a hard interior.  Her fur is soft.  Her tongue, eyes, and nose are hard plastic.

Her bark comes in through the remote control which is kind of weird.

The remote is easy to use, just two buttons.  30 tricks- um not really, but after a few the child moves on anyways.  The skateboard moved easily on my marble floors and struggled a bit on carpet.  While the skateboard is a cute accessory and adds to fun, Trixie is really the main attraction.

"in the description of the product it makes reference to these are rock and roll style boots. these boots are not limited to that. i wear gothic industrial clothing and these boots fit extremely well with buckle/bondage looks.

The quality is very good. i have read many reviews here that complain about the zipper being cheap and it breaks. i believe its the operator not the zipper that breaks them.  you loosen up the laces a bit before you unzip them so you don't over work the zipper. And the same when putting them on. if you have them laced tight and then think you going to jerk the zipper up the next time you are putting them on you are a idiot. the zipper is to make them easier to get on and off. not to do all the work because you are to lazy to loosen the laces first.

they arrived in excellent condition. even the factory box was flawless. they are a bit taller than the description reads. in my point of view. Im 6ft 3 and these boots come up to just below my knee. i have long legs. for a guy that is shorter id recommend the 3 buckle version just so they don't ride up on top of the knee. for woman if you have long legs these are perfect. although for some woman they might be a bit big (soul) to walk in. the soul is wide on the whole boot. i drive a manual transmission car. i can already see im not going to attempt to drive with them on. # pedals is not enough room. i will scuff them up when they rub each other when the clutch and brake are both being used together. driving a automatic transmission car there would be plenty of room. ill just put them on when i reach my destination.

"Just purchased this cat tree a week ago. It arrived quickly and was better than I imagined. The cat houses were large enough for my adult cats. I was worried they might be a little small, but they were spacious enough for one cat to fit in a house at a time and roll around or hide in it. This is my cats first cat tree condo and it won't be their last.

When I purchased this cat tree I saw that there were similar trees for less money, but I chose this one by Armarkat because the reviews said it was sturdy. I must admit this cat tree was easy to put together and it is extremely sturdy. My cats jump on and off and climb it without any wobbling. I have two cats and both are about 13 lbs. The carpet material is a little on the cheapy side, but the cats enjoy it so I can't complain. I purchased the Kong catnip and sprinled some on the cat tree and my cats are in heaven and happy to be up off of the ground. I purchased the 74"" tree and was concerned it might not be tall enough to make the cats feel secure, but it's plenty tall and spacious too!

1, take the rake out of the box (if you have one installed). 2, place the forever rake in place. do NOT screw in yet. observe the location where the ears and the box touch (if they don't in your case, skip step 3. ). 3, use your hands to reshape the rake slightly so NO contacts whatsoever occurs between the ears and the sides of the box. BEWARE: it is very easy to bend the ears. so be gentle. 4, install the rake as instructed. hope this helps. enjoy the clean rake.",4.0,0

"Buyer beware when use with some USB-C to USB-C cable, you might get speed capped 40MB/s:

----------------Apr 26 2016 Update----------------
I changed my review score to 5 to reflect the additional tests I've done to clarify the speed cap myth with Macbook.

After I consult with Apple forum, I get a answer that I might need a USB 3.0 USB-C to USB-c cable. So I did a search, and the ONLY cable mentioned USB 3.1 10Gb/s support is from Belkin:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Belkin-3-Foot-3-1-USB-Type-C-USB-C-to-USB-Type-C-Cable-USB-C-Certified/dp/B00WJSPCSG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Belkin 3-Foot 3.1 USB Type C (USB-C) to USB Type C Cable, USB-C Certified</a>&nbsp;And I tested with Macbook, it correctly recognized with USB 3.0 speed and pushed speed to it's limit. photo 7-8

So, in conclusion, If you want to achieve best performance with USB-C cable, make sure you have a USB-C cable support at least 5Gb/s transfer speed. And some cable like Apple's USB-C, Google's USB-C, Anker USB-C they only support 480Mb/s which is USB 2.0 standard for data transfer.

----------------Old Review----------------

I purchased it to used with my MacBook Retina 12' because of the USB-C support
But there is a real problem for this drive to use with USB-C to USB-C cable:

If you use it with Apple USB-C to USB-C cable, you only get USB 2.0 speed which is capped at 40MB/s in and out. Like the photo 1-3 show below.

If you use it with the accompany USB-A to USB-C cable you will have USB 3.0 speed which is 400MB/s in 425MB/s out. But the inconvenience part is for MacBook you have to use a USB-C to USB-A adapter like the photo 4-6 shows.

So in conclusion: if you purchased it for the USB-C convenience and universal support, you will disappointed with the speed seriously capped into USB 2.0 standard. For the best performance, you have to use the USB-A to USB-C cable, which will put it back to the same category of using a microUSB cable: you'll need adapter to make it work in full speed.",5.0,0

"I purchased this backpack because I read that this was a way to drain more energy from my dog during our walks.  He is a hound mix and he pulls me all over the place when we are walking and I am by no means a small woman.  As of right now we are at the point of him carrying one water bottle on each side for added weight.  It took a bit for him to get used to wearing this so I didn't want to push him too fast.  I imagine that the most I will work him up to is two water bottles per side as I read that they should carry about 5-10% of their body weight.  I have been very pleased so far with the results, while he does still pull me, he gets tired much quicker which saves my shoulders from his yanking.  I am very impressed by how sturdy this is made.  It was easy to adjust to fit him well, he weighs around 65 lbs.  I anticipate this lasting for many years because I have not even noticed a bit of wear and tear in it yet.  I have had many compliments on how dapper he looks in this backpack and folks seem to love the idea that I am giving him a job to do.  Very pleased with my purchase.

  I bought this card to be used in a Ubuntu server where I run Plex to serve my house TVs.  Installation was simple and Ubuntu/Plex worked right away without even having to install any drivers.  It just plain works.

  What I didn't like was the lack of software capabilities.  For Ubuntu there are a couple application you can get like ""Me-Tv"" or ""Kaffine"", or for me ""Plex"".  For Windows users there is less freeware to choose from, instead after buying this card you would have to go to the Hauppauge webpage and spend an additional $10 for the WinTV software.  I feel this software really should come with the card.  Also note:  In some of the screenshots and details that advertise this card it says you can watch multiple shows at the same time (showing four windows).  The only ways to watch multiple shows is with their WinTv software, no other software will let you do this (not even Plex).  Finally, if you using this for Plex note: only the primary plex account can access the program guide to watch TV, none of the other users you've created can access them.",4.0,0

"I would actually give mine a glowing review had it not been for one stiff wrist joint, hand broke off leaving the peg in the slot. His ankles were fine and his paint job was good, so I'm all the more annoyed at myself (I even thought ""Gee, it would suck if I broke the wrist and got the peg stuck in the slot ...""). Aesthetically speaking, it's quite good, though they over did it a bit with the top-heavy look, true, they were pretty barrel chested with tiny legs on the show, but this is just slightly more exaggerated, it's not a deal breaker at all though. While articulated enough to get a fairly wide range of poses, it's still hampered a bit because the range of the joints is limited a bit by the bulk of the figure, only to a small degree however. The only real ""flaw"" I felt there was with it in its own right was the lack of a swivel joint at the hips (a two way ankle join would also have fixed this). The stand is a bit of a joke, though it serves its purpose. Due to the width of his waist it doesn't actually hold him, but it works enough to prop him up with the cape draping over it.

Oh, he also comes with optional capes, couldn't for the life of me figure out how to switch them. Finally, when I broke the wrist I stopped caring and yoinked the head off (I was afraid before there was some other trick ad pulling the head off was requiring no small amount of effort, so ""I didn't want to break it""), that is definitely how it's meant to be done, it's a thick rubber-y plastic on a ball and socket joint (though you only get left/right movement), so I hope that clears up some head scratching.",4.0,0

"I received this belt and I had to return it right away. The Seller did not object, and kindly offered to pay for shipping costs involved. NOTHING was wrong or objectionable with the belt, but despite my efforts to compare my shoes which I placed next to three different computer screens, the color did not match the pair of shoes that I wanted this belt to match.

The reason for this review is because of an issue that I consider of great importance. It is about the Buckle.

Other Sellers offer Ratchet Belts with not only an exceedingly heavy buckle but their buckles have a visible layer of paint. An unacceptable condition occurs when ~in the restroom~ one pulls slacks down. The heavy buckle will drag on the floor, and after several trips to the restroom, approximately half of the painted area has no paint any more. It looks ugly !

This Seller offers the exact same belts with a reliable Ratchet Mechanism and very nice looking leather; but...

Difference #1: the buckle accurately replicate the appealing look of a conventional buckle used for centuries.
Difference #2: there is no paint to scratch.
Difference #3: the buckle is lighter.

BOTTOM LINE - If you guys out there do not want to invest some good money in a belt that everyone notices it is all scratched out and looks ugly just days after you start wearing it, then, this Seller's has resolved that issue brilliantly.

The volume control is a little heavy so if you are moving around and don't clip the audio control somewhere it will pull it out of your ear (that's why they provided a clip) and since the cord comes shipped wrapped up very tightly, the cord is bent all over the place back and forth and will take quite a bit of time to straighten out.

When I opened the box for these and put them on, however, it was like I had finally met my soulmate.

The 514 has been variously labeled as a straight fit or a slim straight fit. I believe this should be correctly labeled as a slim straight fit. However it is nowhere close to being skinny. In my opinion these are best suited for my body type (I am 180cm and 178lbs - with relatively slimmer legs). They hug the thighs just so correctly and do not feel baggy.

They look equally great with moccasins and sneakers - though hang a little loose at the end with my dress shoes. I haven't had a chance to wear them with boots - but I think they would do okay with boots as well (I do not like bootcuts).

The Dirt Rush color is very neutral - a little bit lighter than it appears in the photograph (not necessarily a bad thing) - and looks more greenish in sunlight - however very subdued.

"My plans for this card included testing it using an ExpressCard 34 card reader installed in my older MacBook Pro and using it for the DVR function in a stand-alone surveillance camera. Well, the laptop died and the surveillance cam uses a micro-SD card.

I decided to try something completely different. I bought a Sony MRW-F3 card reader, which is specifically compatible with SD HC and SD XC cards. I then plugged the reader and card into my desktop Mac. Using Disk Utility, I reformatted the card as a bootable Mac OSX drive. I then installed Mac OSX 10.6 (Snow Leopard) on the card and ran Software Update until the installation was current (10.6.8). The desktop machine was booting from the card after the initial install. I copied some diagnostic software from my hard drive and did any setup needed for that software.

What I ended up with is a bootable external drive with diagnostic software. It is recognized as a startup volume by both the Startup Disk system preference and choose boot volume (option key) at startup. The computer boots quickly from the SD card and I did not find any issues running it from the card. The installation of the OS and diagnostic software uses a little more than half of the 16GB capacity. Unfortunately, this did not help my defunct laptop, which does not recognize any kind of drive, internal or external. On the other hand, I now have a quick, easy method of running maintenance routines and diagnostics on the boot drives of my two desktop Macs and any other Mac that can boot into OS 10.6.

"I purchased this toy for my daughters' birthdays (4 and 6), as a shared present, and they love building with it.  This is usually done as a ""group"" project, as some of the pieces are a little bit difficult to snap together for them (but honestly, I have trouble with a few of the pieces myself), but it's been great to see them working together and collaborating on a building project.

I was at first a little worried about whether or not all 400 pieces could be contained in the tote.  Opening the box for the first time dispelled that concern.  The box looked practically empty!  The pieces are very small, and barely cover the bottom of the storage box.  However, don't let that fool you, since you can build lots of things from this seemingly small sprinkle of parts.  The fact that they claim to be compatible with other snap-style building blocks is a bonus.  In any case, there is room for plenty more pieces, should you choose to buy more.

The downside of this toy is that the some of the pieces really are difficult to put together and take apart, and require a good deal of dexterity to do so.  However, given this fact, the finished products are pretty durable because of it.  I remember skinning my fingers as a little girl taking apart my Legos, though, so I'm thinking this might just be a right of passage.",5.0,0

"Update: Note that this is an episode 7 version. Revell released a new version (Last Jedi) in 2018. The new model comes only in black & orange paint version and has a pilot & booster (see the pics). The size of the BB-8 unit & sound effects are also slightly different.
---------------------
I've got 6 Star Wars Build & Play models for my 4 Y.O. boy so far. I think this one is one of the first models in the Build & Play series. While all the others I've got have both ""light"" and sound effects, this one (and the other X-Wing with black & orange camo) has sound effects only. The sound effect is also not as cool/laud as some others (TIE fighter sounds the best IMO). Nevertheless, you can't skip this one if your kid wants a Star Wars Build & Play model I guess. One good side of this is that this one has a little higher chance to survive in your kid's hands, compared to the Level 2 X-Wing from Revell. The Level-2 X-Wing lasted a week or so (My son is extremely cautious when handling his toys) before its super thin laser cannons shafts were bent and some parts fall off. I don't see any advantage of buying Level-2 X-Wing over this one. This Level-1 model looks as good as the level-2 X-Wing.

Compared to other Build & Play models, this and the other X-Wings are exactly the same except for the color. The difficulty is on the low side. If you want to introduce this series to your child before the recommended age (8+), this can be a good starting point. You may also want to try TIE Fighter or Millennium Falcon. I wouldn't start with AT-AT though.",5.0,0

"Our two labs roam our acreage doing their rabbit/mouse/fieldrat routine every day, come rain or shine no matter what the season.  They often came home in the summer afternoon covered in several types of burrs, fescue seed, mud covered noses, dirty faces, and tongues hanging out the sides.

But of course, they've brought home several kinds of ticks who had free loaded back to the homestead.  Going over every inch of their ""happy to see you, dad, I had fun"" bodies was a nightly ritual.  I say WAS because we then discovered the Preventic tick collars.

These collars are the greatest invention since the riding lawn mower!  Now the only ticks we see are the live ones crawling on top of their fur looking for just the right place to bite.  If one does happen to attach, it will be dead within 24 hours.

These collars last 90 days before they need to be replaced.  We put them on the dogs at the first of May when the first ticks appear (although I think the little suckers can crawl at -10 degrees on top of inch thick ice!) and then again at the first of August.  This application keeps the grinning duo tick free and both their lives and our lives much happier.  But I feel they kinda miss the attention of daddy tick hunting their bodies every day.

The dogs have never had the slightest skin irritation due to the collars but we don't but them on extremely tight.  I can still get four fingers under them.  The other nice thing about the collars is that if for some reason they get their collars caught in a fence or a limb, they are easily stretched so the dogs can get themselves loose without choking .  We've had one collar lost only once in the four years we've used the collars and although expensive to lose a collar, well worth knowing the dog wasn't hurt.",5.0,0

"I bought this for my Windows 7 Desktop PC.  I was tired of running a cord from my router in the bedroom to the living room where the PC resides.  I have a Linksys e3000 Router which is a top of the line router.  I wanted a wireless USB device which would allow me to have a full 300MB/s connection.  This one fit the bill and was reasonably priced so I went with it.  After downloading the right drivers from the web I was set to go.  Unfortunately, I could not get a connection higher than 130MB/s.  It seems this device will only work at the full 300MB/S on the 2.4GHz band (not the 5GHz band) and only at the wider channel widths.  I set my router up this way but this would still not pick up at the full 300MB/s.

This would have been bad but not a deal breaker.  But then the device would not keep a stable connection.  It would keep dropping the connection despite the fact that the router was working just fine.  Confirmed this by using my iPad, iPhone, and my Windows laptop to connect to my router every time the connection went down.  They all worked fine.

Given these problems I decided to return the device.",2.0,0

"This diffuser works quite well.  Please see the 3 pictures I uploaded.  The figure was 5.5"" high and 3 feet away.  The wall was 14"" behind the figure.  Pictures were taken at 70mm zoom setting (full frame equivalent of 105mm).  Even with the camera at automatic mode, I still had to increase exposure by +2/3 stops to get equivalent exposure as the picture w/o diffuser.

If your lens does not rotate during focus, then you should attached it close to the front of the lens.  When you zoom to telephoto, the diffuser is pushed even farther from the flash, making the diffused lighting even more effective.  This is great for macro photography.

The diffuser is rather large (12"" total height).  When attached to my Nikon 18-105mm lens with a 67mm filter, the hole and the elastic band are almost at their maximum.  The diffuser flops in the wind a bit and will flop even more if your lens is smaller.  I found it easier to mount the diffuser with the lens cap still on the lens.

The carrying pouch is much bigger than needed.  You can just wrap the folded diffuser with a rubber band and put it in your pocket.  I don't think getting it slightly dirty will affect the use of it at all.  Overall, quite happy with this diffuser.",5.0,0

"I was visiting a friend who had one of these for her kids.  My youngest at the time was fascinated by this.  I don't know why.  I mean, I don't think it's weird or anything, in fact far from it.  But there is just something about it that kept my kid's attention for a long time.  He was all over using the drill to put the bolts into the board, then unscrew them, then back and forth again.  It is the darndest thing.

So it looks overly simple, and to my adult eyes I can't help but wonder what the big deal is.  But I'm not a four year old, and said four year old was enamored with it.

Of course we had to get one of our own.  The biggest challenge is keeping all the parts together - screws get lost and all of that, but it's still fascinating for that kid.  It's a great toy.",5.0,0
"I got these because they look great, like equipment you might find on the spaceship in 2001: A space Odyssey.  I was tempted to keep them just for that. The problem is that I don't like using them.

For this price I didn't expect them to sound great, and they don't, but they are good enough for audio books and podcasts. Turns out they are uncomfortable for me. I think they could be comfortable with velour pads instead of the synthetic leatherette material. I think the leatherette material is meant to provide sound isolation, but in fact these headphones offer no appreciable sound isolation.

The biggest problem is the severe cord noise. I hear this noise even with small head movements. Heretofore, I had heard this kind of noise only with earphones (in-ear monitors), never with headphones. It's strange that only one other reviewer has complained about the cord noise with these headphones.

I might add that these headphones are larger than they look in the photo. They are large enough that I'd almost call them clunky. They are much larger than the better-sounding Sennheiser PX100, which are my favorites in lightweight portable supra-aural headphones.

"So I purchased these with the intention of looking more well polished at work when wearing my dresses and skirts. What I like about them is how comfortable they are and how easy it is to wear them as they aren't as delicate since the material is strong and of good quality. Of very durable quality as well as I don't have to worry about them ripping or breaking! They are not lightweight which I love as they are not thick or too overbearing.
They stayed on quite well and I especially love the sheer color of it as it makes me feel sexy as they are obviously see through and look really good on me. I like how I can wear these with my office outfits as well as with casual clothes as they are both stylish and fashionable. I can dress them up or down and still look fabulous. Overall, I am content with this purchase as they are cozy, comfy and sexy! I purchased these at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review and I am glad that I did so as they look good and feel even better! They fit as expected as well!",5.0,0

"OMG, First reason why I chose this style is because it is a nice fit for a person with a narrow foot.  The front of the shoe is slightly wider than the back, so that it is a little smaller in the heel.  The front is very soft and gives good support.  The straps are very comfortable and the material is very soft and soft.  The color is very nice and the material is very comfortable.  The only reason I didn't buy this style was because it is very short for a woman, but I am glad I did.  I am usually a size 6, but ordered a medium.  The length is perfect.  The fabric is soft, but the color is very bright and vivid.  It is a cute color to wear for a costume.  I wish it had the support that I need.  I would recommend this style for anyone.I really like these shoes.  I have had a few pairs of these in the past.  They are very comfortable and are very comfortable.

"They arrived in the style pictured without defects. I have had Hanes underwear fall apart at the elastic, and I hope this wider band Fruit of the Looms do better. They are fitted, but comfortable. They don't slide up and show above my jeans. The colors I received were neon mint, blue, dark heather purple, dark lilac, dark lilac with dots, and grey with dots.

Box-sizing says: XS is for pant wearers 2-4, S is for women who wear 4-6, size 6 Medium is for women who wear size 8-10, size 7 Large is for women who wear size 12-14 bottoms, size 8 XL is for women who wear 14-16 pants, and size 9 2XL is for women who wear size 16-18.

I wear a lot of skinny low rise jeans, and these are low rise underwear. They barely cover my full booty but are fairly spot on.

I am 5'3 and 115 pounds, and I usually wear between an XS and S or size 4. But, I'm a curvy petite and somewhat pear-shaped. I ordered these in 5- which is size 4-6 for women. They were fitted! But I like them. I think after washing and wearing a bit they'll be perfect. So, I'd suggest if between sizes like I am, go up one.

"These are very comfy shoes! I usually wear a 10 and bought a 10 in these and they fit perfectly.  I have medium wide feet and they are roomy and comfortable. The goga mat insole is what makes this shoe I think. It has a really nice rubbery bounce feel under my feet. I have been having problems with my feet hurting from not enough cushion in my old running shoes and these have been a really nice change with my feet not hurting after my walks ( I walk about 5-6 miles a day on gravel trails, and the gravel usually pokes up into the bottom of my shoes and bruises my feet but these protected me pretty good).  I didn't like the looks of this shoe online but purchased it because I was looking for skechers and other brands that have very cushioned rides. These looked better in person than I thought and the mesh look is different looking in person (it seems like it's more of a fabric texture and less of a large mesh material than it looks like in the picture, although they seem breathable enough, they don't have large mesh holes like I originally pictured). I'm still not in love with the way these look, but they are good for taking out on the trails, and it's kind of nice to have a new pair of shoes I don't mind getting dirty (instead of the pretty kind of new shoes that I really only want to save for the gym and places they won't get messed up :)

"With the soft sounds and colors, this toy is a superb companion for any toddler and introduce him/her to the subtleties of music. Our 15 months old liked this toy but it is a bit early for him to get engaged with it. It seems to be more suitable for an 18 months old as recommended by the manufacturer or even older toddlers who gain basic understanding of cause and effect and the rhythms in the sound.

I wish the string was longer than mere 9"". The center of the wooden handle with string is about 12"" long in total. That is too short even for average height toddler. Kids do not pull toys with hands stretched all the way down. Most of the time he pulls the string at chest level which renders the toy hanging in air instead of being a pull toy.

It is very good for a sit down play and can engage a toddler if he gets interested in music. Otherwise, as a pull toy it may not work successfully. With the current price range, I would expect that the designers in the company must have thought through this aspect.

"As a former sporting goods purchasing agent for Kmart about 15-16 years ago - when the first mass production of metal scooters were being imported from China - I can say that I've seen a few scooters in my lifetime. Some of those sample scooters lasted me until today - scooters my kids can still enjoy these days. This is a scooter with a great concept for power - it's all manual yet very simple to operate. The one big issue I have with this item that otherwise claims to hold riders up to 90 kg =200lbs(surprisingly, this is the same weight limit as the jr. model, which is aimed at 4-8 year olds) is the following: the plastic enclosure at the bottom of the scooter, the part that holds a wire and is close to the ground seems extremely fragile. I venture to say if a kid rides on the sidewalk and then decides to go jump on the street, that plastic piece could easily get smashed in the sidewalk corner, and render the entire scooter useless.",4.0,0

"OK, so first of all, as a calendar: I was annoyed that the numbers were all out of order. This made things difficult to find. I was also annoyed that the pictures on the front seem to indicate what will be behind which door, but then they weren't accurate. Now, all that said, it was nice that each door had a compartment tray behind it, and that they doors had directions on the back of the paperboard for each one. Each bag was also labeled with its number, just in case things got misplaced.

Now, as a Megablok set: I have really enjoyed Mega Blok's interpretation of Star Trek and TMNT characters. This set is a bit below the standards set by those previous sets. You only get 158 pieces, which isn't a terribly good value compared to other sets. Many of the pieces here are uninspiring to say the least. A bush? A weapon holder? There are, at least, three main characters to be had, Shredder, Casey Jones, and a turtle who can be switched via headband between all four characters. But the figures themselves are a bit below the standards set by other iterations. The legs don't move as well, the hands pop out of the arms for some reason, and assembling them is rather difficult for a kid, and even for a grownup, due to the difficulty of popping ball joints into sockets.

For the money, I'd prefer to see twice as many character figures and a lot less filler. My son, turning five in a few weeks, did enjoy that he could put together the simpler items on his own. But overall I think this represents a poor value compared to the other superior Mega Bloks sets in the TMNT family, such as the Krang set or the jungle tank set. And compared to other Advent calendar sets, such as the Lego Star Wars one, this is a poor value as well, as that set has 100 more pieces and 9 minifigures compared to 3 here.",3.0,0

"First off, let me just say we spoil our dog.  I'm sure most people do.  For our little Maltese, we've tried a variety of dental chews.  His favorite treats are Greenies.

After one visit to the vet, we were told that Greenies are made predominantly of wheat and that could lead to problems in the later years.  We were giving him at least two a day.  She recommended giving him one maybe every other day or on special occasions.  So the hunt began...

Of all of them, Greenies are his favorites.  They're also the cheapest.

The size of these are a little larger than the Greenies.  They're also pretty cheap on Amazon compared to a local pet store.  They do seem a little tougher than the other dental chews.  All of the other ones seem a bit softer, but these are a bit rough and harder.  One thing that we liked about them is that they are wheat free and gluten free.  Our dog seems to like them.

We try to mix it up and give him different treats throughout the week.  These are a good treat to throw in the mix if you'd like to do that.  They're no Greenies, but if it will keep our little guy healthier a little longer, then we'll continue to give him these and spoil him at the same time.",5.0,0

"Got a yellow gold 3mm comfort fit band on lightning deal. What a great buy!! Amazon is awesome. Fits great and I don't even notice that i'm wearing it. Shiny, smooth, and highly polished.

"What I like most about this is the amount of water that it holds.  As a mom, I used to have to fill the kids water guns or risk my wood floors being drenched with water that they spill when filling.  This holds a lot of water!  I bought one for my son's friend, because whenever he came over, he'd beg to wear it or drench my floors with spilled water from his small canister that comes with his Nerf water gun.  My only word of caution is that since water is heavy, either don't let a real small kid wear it or only fill it up partially.  My kids were 7 and 9 when we first used this and they both promised it did not feel too heavy.  You can fill it up until you think it is a good weight for your child.  My kids also add ice cubes to make it a frozen blast.  I also like how it get's them outside for hours and they can cool off with the blasts.",5.0,0

"This is an extremely inexpensive solution for that smaller TV. We needed to get our kitchen TV off the counter and this does the trick. It was relatively easy to mount, I'm pretty handy, using a drill, socket wrench and level. If you don't know what those are then you will have problems getting this up on a wall. Don't skimp on the screws or hardware, you don't want this falling on someone. Mine is mounted into a stud and I can hang on the bracket (150lbs). The only issue I have is that it doesn't fold quite as flat to the wall as I had hoped, so if space is an issue then you may want a different mount. It does, however, swing and rotate exactly where we would like it.",4.0,0

The audio quality is fine and the radio adequate. I mostly listen to my local college station which is within ten miles of my home, it plays that very well. The scroll through menu is logical and easy to read. My only negatives were that it is virtually impossible to read in bright sunlight and the menu when going from MP3 player to other features is not as straightforward as I would like. Also MP3 player is the default mode. If you turn it off set to the radio, when you turn it on again it will be set in MP3 mode. That is not really a bug, but it is a bit of an annoyance.

Secondly I had expected a knit fabric and this is a broadcloth  type fabric, you know the type of men shirts are made out of but with lots of stretch to it.

"Update August 8, 2012:

We've had this product for about a year now, and I'm still really happy with it.  It's definitely full from my dog, but we have not had any overflow issues.  I'm just about out of the powder that comes with the unit, so I'll need to get some more.  Otherwise, it's been a really convenient product to have.

I would suggest that you seriously dig the depth hole that they recommend in the instructions.  The deeper the better though as sometimes the dog poop will fall down in the hole when you flush the unit with water.

Original Post:

In all honesty, I was a bit pessimistic when I first got this thing a few months ago, but I was desperate enough to buy it.  Thankfully I did, as it's been a great addition to our household and in keeping out yard (and garbage) clean.

The unit is real easy to install.  Just dig a hole, shove it in, fill it up with water and the enzyme they give you, and you're off.  I am lazy with the unit, and normally just pick up our dogs (we just have one) poop on the weekend, and then every month flush the unit with 5-gallons of water and add more enzyme.  The thing seems to really be working.  We have dog play dates regularly, and the unit seems to be able to handle it.  Also, we're currently reaching 20 degree nights and 40 degree day here in Seattle, and it seems to still be working.

While this thing holds a lot of poop, I'm pleasantly surprised that there is not a horrible stench (sure it has a slight poo smell, but it's not gagging).  Definitely would recommend this unit to others who want to dispose of their dogs waste in their backyard.",5.0,0

"This is such a cute little fake guitar.  It is push button rather than anything with real strings.  You play it by pushing the button where you would normally strum the guitar and you do ""fret"" work by pushing down on the interior of the fret section of the guitar.  There is a flip section that alternates the music between electric and acoustic.

My grandson is almost 18 months old and doesn't really know who Dora is as he watches very little on TV (and then only a couple of specific DVDs.)  We do, however, play a lot of instruments amongst the family - just in my house along there are over a dozen different instruments.  He even has a small ukelele of his own at his house that he plays with.  He grabbed the Dora guitar as soon as I showed it to him and showed him which buttons to push.  He ""played"" guitar all afternoon - carrying it around with him everywhere.  He would stop and start dancing and shaking his head to the tunes or would drop the guitar to clap - and then realize that he had to play it again to make the music continue.

The final move of the day was when he put it in his pop-up castle (along with his much beloved Fisher-Price piano keyboard) where it will wait until next week when he comes to my house again.  He loved it and played with it for hours.  His smile was so big, I wondered if it hurt his face to keep it up all afternoon. I'll probably pull out one of my guitars and then we can rock out together.

This is a really cute toy guitar and I recommend it highly.  I don't know why it is recommended for 3 years and up.  I don't see any small pieces that could be a hazard and my little guy loved it at 18 months.",5.0,0

"MagWorld tiles are fun for kids, and they inspire imaginative play.  My 4-year-old daughter loves to play with these.  There is a good variety of shapes and sizes, and this 60-piece set is a nice size.  I think if you had a smaller set, it would be difficult to build much, but 60 is enough.  The reason I am giving these four stars instead of five is that these tiles are clearly not as ""sticky"" as MagnaTiles, which are also significantly pricier.  These tiles do not stick together as well because the tiles are thicker, which has the effect of making the magnets seem weaker.  There may be an added safety benefit in that these tiles are more difficult to break, but the extra ""stickiness"" of MagnaTiles is appreciated by my daughter.",4.0,0

"Our family loves playing games, but no one was looking forward to playing Candyland over-and-over again when our grandson was ready to play games. ""Monkeying Around"" seemed as if it might be an excellent alternative.  The adults in our family who play games and, most importantly, the little ones think ""Monkeying Around"" is a winner. It is sturdy, colorful, and delights our grandson when the monkeys topple the tree. The game is challenging enough for adults - determining balance and distribution of the monkeys - so that they are not adverse to playing this game with the little ones in your household.

""Monkeying Around"" seems to be durable and able to take enthusiastic toddler play. The monkeys are plastic and will not break; we keep them in a Ziploc sandwich bag ton prevent losing them. If the game structure is dropped, the tree trunk which is made of hard plastic could possibly break, so we do put the assembled tree out of reach when not in use. The spinner is probably the weakest aspect of ""Monkeying Around"" - it does not spin particularly easily. A better option would have been an arrow-shaped spinner attached to a cardboard square with the numbers and large monkey printed in the different segments.

Players will learn to make decisions when each must decide where monkeys should be hung.  Little ones learn there are consequences for choosing to incorrectly place the monkey. Further, the game teaches a child to think about balance and weight distribution when deciding where the monkeys are to be hung.

""Monkeying Around"" is an excellent way to introduce games to a child. The recommended age range of 4 and up is probably appropriate; at 3, a toddler may not fully understand taking turns.  However, ""Monkeying Around"" is an excellent way for a child to begin understanding that concept.",5.0,0

"I have a very high instep, got it from my grandma, and a bunch of family members suffer with the issue as well, including my son, aunt and sister.  Those are the ones I know about.  It's a problem for getting shoes that fit at all, especially shoes I can wear for any length of time.

Amazon is my go-to place for shoes that have the sizes I need.  There is no guarantee the shoes will be comfortable.  It's entirely the fault of my feet, and not the shoes.

The problem with a high instep is most shoes are not really comfortable.  This particular shoe cut into the top of my foot.  It's not a cut that bleeds, certainly, but it's definitely a huge indentation in the top of my foot, which goes away in a few hours.  I wore them for a wedding, my son's wedding, and I literally had to take them off to go down the stairs to walk down the aisle with my son and husband.  They were actually too big, and I was afraid they would fall off down the stairs, which would make me trip.

"Purchased four of these camera's the info that comes with them sucks . This is the fifth one that I received the picture was blurry right out of the box. Never had a camera that was blurry right out of the box. I finally hooked it up a video camera, put it on my lap and played with the focus and zoom knobs. Nothing I did would bring it into focus. So I returned this one. I forgot which knob adjusts what, there are no directions to tell you. I didn't matter I played with it more a half hour and nothing worked, so back it goes. I got four good ones, so I reordered it. The four that I am using have been working for about a year and a half They are very clear and have very good night vision. The only problem you could have with these cameras is, that the night vision is so strong, that it might be too bright in close in setting..
Update; Got another one of these, they shipped it really fast. Perfectly focused in the widest position. Mounted it adjusted a little bit. Happy camper  now. What makes a camera like this so good, is, that you can put them anywhere and make them work. It is very difficult to find a fixed lens 2.8 MM camera. So this does it all. A note. I've had one of these mounted out from under the eave where it is exposed  to sun and the rain, no problems. It has been there for about a year and a half. The main weakness of this camera is, the IR coverage. I throws out an intense spotlight leaving the edges in darkness. I would say the coverage is about 2/3 of the area.

"Everlasting Fun Treat Ball / B0009YD8NS

I have several treat dispensing toys for my puppy, and I like this one the least. The design is very poor, in my opinion, at least compared to other treat toys we've used. To begin with, it is difficult to ""load"" the toy with food and treats because there are two identical loading holes, one opposite the other. This means that when I pour treats in, they pour right out on the opposite side. It's like filling a bucket with no bottom, and it's very frustrating. Eventually, you have to just find the biggest treats you can, and jam them in, which is a pain and a half. Not to mention the edges of the hole catch and grab at your fingers - fun!

That brings me to my next point - you cannot put small treats or puppy kibble in here as they will fall out immediately. Only big fat treats will provide the dog a challenge, but fortunately the makers of this product make such treats and are more than willing to sell them to you. Which is fine, I guess, and I went ahead and bought some, but I prefer to fill my treat toys with at least some regular kibble so that the puppy doesn't just gorge himself on a bunch of rich treats all at once. Since this ball won't allow me to do this, it's now an occasional toy, not a reliable daily toy. Bottom line: I feel that this toy is difficult to fill, and can only be used for ""treat gorging"" and not for regular dinner time. If your fingers are less delicate than mine and you just want a treat ball, you may like this - my dog certainly likes the chewy rubber and he hasn't destroyed it yet (although he's not much of a chewer). However, if you want an easy to fill ball that can hold kibble and enliven dinner time, I recommend the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Omega-Paw-Tricky-Treat-Ball/dp/B0002DK26M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Omega Paw Tricky Treat Ball</a>.",3.0,0

"I was one of the first to purchase Trakdots when they initially came out, then quickly learned (a) there is virtually no user support, and (b) the software was horribly flawed. Since then, the company has paid buyers to ship the units back for a ""major software update,"" but...getting my two units back has been a nightmare.

I shipped them to the vendor, as directed, in early November, yet here I am in late January, STILL trying to get my supposedly-updated TrakDots back. Endless emails back and forth, lots of ""We'll overnight them right away"" promises, but nothing.

If it was possible to give negative stars on a review, I would. TrakDots are a complete waste of money.

* * * * * 01.30.14 FOLLOW UP * * * * *

Finally got two units back. Notice I didn't say ""my units."" In spite of assurances we'd be getting our originals back, I was sent two open box returns that someone else dumped. The security seals on both boxes were torn open; the serial number on one unit had been completely removed (rendering it incapable of being activated) with the ""Warranty void if damaged"" seal torn in half.

One of my two originals had yet to be activated (read: brand new, unused). Now, I'm holding someone else's rejects.

* * * * * 02.11.14 FOLLOW UP * * * * *

After circling back to TrakDot *again,* was sent two more replacement units. These did not appear to have been opened, however...neither one would power on. Tried multiple batteries, to no avail. Both units were dead boxes.

This time, I cc'd (Harry Streck, President of GlobaTrac) on my email to Customer Service, asking for a full refund of my entire purchase price, including the pre-paid first year of service for each unit. Getting Mr. Streck involved made the difference--while Customer Service continued to try a ""Let's talk first"" approach, he apologized for the problems, and issued a full refund, call-tagging the four faulty replacement units.

Trakdot is, without question, the worst purchase decision I've ever made, but at least I got my money back. Finally.",1.0,0

"My cats loved this product. I used Instinct food for them prior to starting to make my own food two years ago. Originally, I had purchased the rabbit treats until one kitty developed a rash under his chin. Okay, switched to chicken. First cat's problem went away. Then a second cat developed LUMPS under her chin. Not a rash, lumps. Lumps were surgically removed, pathology done, results were; ""typical with an allergic reaction."" As the only other item that ever crosses their lips were these treats, the vet zeroed in on the treats as the culprit. (My food is made from chicken thighs, livers, gizzards and hearts, all human grade, from the human food case at the store.) In hindsight I should have known better after the first kittie's reaction...this has been a very expensive error on my part. The rest of my cats (there are 11) showed no outward reactions. They have consumed the treats on an off for for over a year. No idea if something in the product changed, or if my furchildren grew resistant to the product's ingredients.

"My daughter and I love puzzle/strategy type games.  I hadn't heard of Kanoodle Genius before, but when we received the game, we knew this would be perfect for us!

The game consists of a small, compact box, making it great for travel.  The pieces are carefully packaged inside so that they won't get lost. This will be great for all our trips and camping trips, and doesn't take up much space in a backpack or suitcase.

You pick a puzzle from the book included, and then use the game pieces to solve the puzzle - both in 2D and 3D!  The puzzle pieces consist of textured balls that are connected in a variety of configurations and colors.  The texture made it easier to get the pieces together without them slipping around.

The challenges are tough!  I love that there are a variety of puzzles to choose from, and I found myself having fun with this game, giving myself a little brain workout!  My daughter is almost 8 and we worked together to finish the puzzles.  She had a lot of fun with this game, as she loves puzzles and challenging herself.

This is a great game that can be enjoyed by both kids and adults.  You can play it on your own or work with a friend to get the puzzle done.  This is a fantastic addition to our game shelf and I'm sure will get a lot of use for years to come!

She is the size of a Barbie.
She can't stand alone; however her legs move at the hips.  Her knees don't bend.
The front of her bodice is  sparkly, molded plastic, but the back of her molded plastic bodice is not sparkly.
Snow White's hair is very stiff & shouldn't get messed up easily.
Her shoes will not stay on.  We're thinking of using double-sided sticky tape to see that will work. If that doesn't work, we might glue the shoes on...then again, we might forget about the shoes & let Snow White go barefoot.
Her skirt can be removed; the top piece of her skirt is sparkly.
Snow White has a plastic tiara that seems like it can't be pulled off. Granddaughter's sleeping with Snow White now, so I can't check.

"UPDATE May 20th ... Eh, now that I have actually seen this bag in person (ordered and shipped direct to Mom for Mother's Day) today was the first time I saw it myself ... gotta take away one star .. and have to agree with the other reviewer regarding the (newly discovered!) shoulder strap attachments, or lack thereof.

I finagled the strap to attach on both sides via the metal attachments holding the short handles; one clip on one side and one on the other. It works, but it is kinda tacky looking. Strap stays out of the way and the bag is balanced, but it doesn't look good.

The bag is much larger than I figured it was going to be.  It's one thing to SAY x"" x x"", but you really have to SEE it to comprehend it. It's okay, but it is a little 'large'.

The cute little 'bow' on the front that sold me actually works and when you unfasten it it makes that tan flap flip up and reveal a tiny pocket under it.  Great storage for cash or credit cards, maybe a SMALL cell phone if you don't need it quick.

Tons of space in the main compartment but nothing zippered. Three individual compartments and the main compartment.

In my opinion, it's a better handbag than a shoulder bag. It is cute, it appears to be well made, give that it is not genuine leather - that stuff has it's setbacks too though.

For the price, and if you are in need of a handbag, I'd say yes to this one.

"***UPDATE: December 10th, 2016 - Now that the price dropped to $260, plus $20 rebate, I take back everything I said about the RX 480. Because now, you're essentially paying the same price, for up to 50% more power. The compromise is the increased power draw and electricity bill, but if you're a PC gamer, you don't really care about it too much. Performance is the ultimate goal, and this card delivers in spades. It is the perfect balance of price/performance - $150 cheaper than a GTX 1070, for about 80-90% of the performance. That's amazing.

**UPDATE: August 6th, 2016 - What's even more amazing is that as of right now Amazon is only selling it for $310!**

This is amazing deal, compared to what the other R9 Fury's that are selling on Amazon. It's a little too little, a little too late, as the RX 480's and the the GTX 1060's are already here, with a better price per performance ratio. In a sandbox, an R9 Fury for $350 is a great deal, so that's why I'm giving it give stars. But in the real world, you would be better off to get two Rx 480 4GB's, and only pay $50 more for about 1.5x the performance.

"I wanted to use it with my TV. Basically use a Bluetooth headphone with a TV. Once you connect to a bluetooth device you can hear this background humming sound. I'm very sure that its from this device and not the bluetooth headphones. I use the headphones very regularly. The humming sounds I suppose can be ignored because once the sound starts playing you don't hear it. But then there is a delay in the sound. I think it's about half a second (or maybe 300ms) which is pretty bad. Bad enough that you can't really watch TV like that. Considering the quality of sound, the delay and the background humming, its not worth the price.

"I wanted to revitalize my early 2011 MacBook Pro.  The drive itself works mostly as expected (about 12% slower than its specs).  But the installation was arduous and can be expensive.

First, the drive is formatted for Windows and all the software provided is Windows only.  So you need to use Disk Manager to erase the disk, rename it to something meaningful, and reformat it to Mac OS Extended Journaled.  Then you need a piece of software like Carbon Copy Cloner to mirror your existing hard disk onto the new SSD.  CCC is a great software package, which you should probably own anyway for various backup tasks, but if you don't already have it, buying it adds to the expense of the upgrade.

The provided installation guide is a pamphlet of 8 pictures for installing on a desktop, 6 pictures for installing on a laptop, and 1 frame of cautions.  All very generic and useless for my MacBook Pro.  By the way, both sets of pictures show a SATA-to-USB adapter cable for cloning, which was not included and must be purchased separately.

The installation requires a 7mm to 9.5mm space adapter for 2.5 drives.  Again this is an additional purchase as the Samsung SSD is more shallow than the original drive.  The actual physical installation involves removing the cover, removing the drive clamp and old drive, removing the 4 stud screws on the old drive and putting them onto the SSD, applying the spacer (be sure to orient the drive to the cable connector before adhering it), seating the drive (it still seemed a little loose), re-installing the drive clamp and replacing the cover.  The studs are required on the new drive to make sure it seats into the clamp.  Why Samsung couldn't spend an extra $.0005 and include these on the SSD is unknown.

So, overall 4 stars for the drive, 0 stars for the lack of Mac installation support and the required accessory expenses, averaging out to 2 stars for this review.",2.0,0

"After 4 months!  Sometimes I go several days without using it. When I do use it, it may be for only 5 minutes or up to 90 minutes.

"I'm not an audiophile. My golden ears from yesteryear have tarnished rather badly.  I wanted a no-frills subwoofer to balance out my good-but-small bookshelf speakers. The first of these units arrived damaged: the grille had sheared off and could not be reattached. The company was perfect. They told me what to do and sent a replacement unit with no complaint or hassle. It came quickly. The instructions aren't the very clearest, but it didn't take long to figure it out and set it up. One complaint: whoever designed the connector array never, ever tried to connect anything to it. The connectors, even if they were well placed, are hard to use; but they're crammed together such that my not-very-big fingers had a heck of a time connecting the speakers. Much bad language was used. In terms of function, I can set the unit to make much more boom-boom than I want or to be almost silent - or anything in between, including a setting I like. The other speakers are routed through this unit, which ostensibly leads to better balance. Can't prove it by me, but the result seems fine.",4.0,0

"Really a neat bag to carry all kinds of stuff. It is totally soft sided & collapsible-also alot roomier than you'd expect. However, the bottom is also just soft canvas & if you're carrying a netbook/laptop you will need to protect them by adding padding to the bottom or carrying them in some other casing. Also the center compartment is not stitched to the bottom, so anything in those two compartments will travel around the bottom of the bag. I think that area was designed as a holder for paperwork, but you can reinforce it by just stitching it down to the bottom seam. I really liked the bag so I added some stiff padding to the bottom to protect my netbook and give the bag a little sturdier footing for when it's set down vs. just letting everything flop around the bottom of the bag. All things considered, for the price-it's a keeper. Looks durable,very roomy, easy to store & just a neat bag to have.",4.0,0

"This set includes 5 different animals that are on the endangered species list.  There is a black rhinoceros, manatee, giant panda, cheetah, and albatross.  The animals all have great detail. The wrinkles on the rhino and manatee are realistic.  They are well made from a thick plastic.  The set also comes with an activity guide.  The activity guide gives lots of great information about each of the animals in the set.  It gives information like why the animal is endangered, where they live, and special characteristics.  It also gives discussion starters and a couple of activities.

I opened it up and my son immediately asked questions.  He started to name the couple he knew.  I corrected or helped with the couple he didn't know.  We talked about the animals and a little about each.  I told him they are all endangered and of course he asked what that meant.  We talked a little about them, but mostly he just likes to pretend play with them.  He was pretending today that the manatee was swimming really fast and then he broke his tail so he was swimming slow and then it got better and he went fast.  Such a 4 year old play game.  There is so much play that can happen with these animals.  Pretend play is such a valuable skill to learn and why not add in some other learning.

  The Jumbo Endangered Animals are for ages 2 years and up.  I really think they can be used for many years.  There are so many learning uses for these animals.  Any child that likes animals would love these.  They would make a great gift.",4.0,0

"Customer service/warranty from this company is non exsistant. I have the largest one of these bowls and the stem on the bottom broke which then would not allow the water to flow up through the machine thus defeating the purpose and rendering it trash. I called customer service and they refused to replace it and told me to buy a new dome (the whole part that holds the water) for $59! More than the whole machine! I was then forced to glue it. Like other reviews have said, the dome leaks also. If you flip it over (right side up) after filling it any where but over the bowl, you will get a huge mess. The power plug gets extremely hot which is a safety hazard. Where the water flows down the side at the top, there are slits under the gray ring which allow the water to roll down the dome...you cant get to those very easy for cleaning and they become black with mold fairly fast (pretty nasty). If you have hard water, forget it because it will never come clean.

"Its always been a struggle for me to find clothes that fits perfectly on me. One that I don't have to do something and alter it or cut the legs to be the exact length for my legs. I am size one and the waist and hips of size one usually fits on me aside from the legs part. They usually are longer and even though I got a size one of thissuper comfy stretch denim five pocket jeans it is still a little big on me especially on the hip and back side maybe because I am not that gifted on that part. The hip is also a bit higher than my usual preference but that is fine since I don't tuck my shirts. I wish that the front pockets are a little deeper. These are the down sides when purchasing clothes online. Even if you got your size there is no guarantee that it fits exactly the same. Others are cut differently and sometimes smaller or bigger on you. I will just have to remedy it since thats what I normally do. Despite that the jeans was well made and the stitches are sturdy. The fabric stretches just like they said it is which is a good thing since for me, stretchable jeans are more comfortable to wear and easier to take off than the denims.

"When the MH dolls first came out I thought. ""With the way they pop on and off, why not do them all like this and make them interchangeable?""  yeah great idea right?  No, not when Mattel is being greedy. I made the mistake of buying almost everyone of these kits. God Help Me!  I got completely ripped off. They are cheap, the wigs look like crap, the arms and legs are loose, and the hip joints break with little movement. I cant believe that Mattel has gotten so cheap. I mean first the first set of MH dolls end up breaking like crazy, then this?  Come on Mattel don't you have enough money????? Do you really have to rip off us parents this close to Christmas????  This set was NOT worth the money, and I didn't pay hardly anything for it at the store. None of these sets are worth a flip. I might as well toss them ALL in the trash or had just set my dollars on fire in the store. I will be very cautious in buying ANYTHING new from Mattel that is MH. So parents just beware. If you buy any of these kits just know that you are getting half of what you pay for, if that. What is next?  A pile of crap with the MH logo on it?  Really Mattel, really?  This set is even worse than the others and I bought them all unfortunately! The wings won't stay on, none of the torsos look good with any of it. The wig is cheapy, it looks like crap. the dress looks like it is cheap and it isn't even. The velcro is off to the side and you can see it from the front. It just looks terrible.

"Although these can hardly be called ""shorties"" -- they hit mid-thigh -- they are definitely comfortable ""smoothers.""  I can wear mine all day, and I only occasionally remember that I'm wearing them.  A medium fits a pants size 8-10.

I was a little surprised to see how sheer these are, without any seams at the bottom.  But the lack of hem is a great idea since no one can see the line where the shapewear ends.  (If you buy too small, you might see a difference between the compressed area and your thigh.)  Because they are so sheer, the amount of control is light, but the smoothing factor is strong.  Especially under tight or stretchy pants, these smooth out bumps nicely.  Yeah, they don't work miracles, but they can make your body look sleeker than it is.

I'm always concerned that shapewear, particularly the kind that targets thighs, will ride up.  On a full, 16-hour day of wearing the shorty shapewear,  this might happen two or three times at most, and it's never so bad that it's uncomfortable or visible.  I never feel the pinch at my waist that I had with another brand that I tried.  Perhaps because these offer moderate control -- as opposed to full-on squeezing -- they are the most comfortable shapewear I've worn.

The fact that I've actually bought two sets of these makes it even worse. I'll keep the review short and simple.

Pros:
1. Easy to install and use
2. Buttons light up, can turn the feature on or off

Cons:
1. Buttons lights up and off too quickly, lights do not stay long enough
2. Distance for radio signal is poor, it's best not to have interference or obstacles in front or in between the signal path
3. The mouse wheel is infrared sensor, which kind of works but not as well as a mouse wheel. It's not as precise and you almost always lose track
4. Due to poor signals, I would constantly have to type something on TV and look at the pad, then look at the TV again to make sure the signal took the input, because sometimes it would not.

"Bottom Line - Convenient, lightweight, small, and most importantly SAFE for your pup.  Dog harness crash testing has a long way to go, and most products don't truly protect your dog from getting injured or injuring others during a crash.  This Sleepypod system is one of the few that is proven to work well.  You won't regret this purchase, and your canine friend will thank you for it.

Pros
-Tested and proven.  This is the most important criteria for me, and it was a must in my purchase of any vehicle harness.
-Does not require you to latch into the baby seat hooks.  It's as simple as stringing the seatbelt through the hoops.
-Lightweight and small enough to be utilized as a regular walking harness *for short walks.*  For instance, if I am making a quick run to my home department store and I want to take the dog, this Clickit can serve as a vehicle safety harness and a walking harness all in one.  I would not recommend it for long walks, running, or hikes, however, as it isn't nearly as nimble, lightweight, and breathable as other dedicated sport harnesses (and it isn't supposed to be).

Cons
-The leash clips don't have enough slack, so it's a little more difficult than it needs to be to clip a leash onto both D-rings.  Not impossible, but just more difficult than it needs to be.
-The adjustability is not quite where I would like it to be.  My dog has an interesting shape with a relatively large chest with a small neck.  We had to buy the medium due to her chest size and weight, but the neck adjustment is ever-so-slightly too large even when adjusted as tight as it can be.",5.0,0

"I have attempted to use a bark collar 3 times and sent them all back for various reasons. This one is perfect. The charging system is excellent.  It has a rubber flap that stays secure when the collar is on. Many other don't provide this simple flap. The available setting, number 2, gradually increases the shock until the dog reacts. It is very humane because my dog knows how far she can take it. It allows her to still guard but with a little grumble, just enough to get her point across but stops her from the loud bark. She knows that when she has it on she is off duty.  She calms down immediately when it's on.  It did take consistent use, like any training, but I saw results within days.  I have used it now for 3 months and putting it on her is no big deal. The most important thing is that I don't feel guilty about using it.  She learned very quickly and only got shocked a few times until she understood her limits. It was hard to hear her yelp when it shocked her but I stuck to it and honestly, she learned quickly and the result is amazing. She never gets shocked any more when I put it on her.  It just helps her relax and keeps her in check. As long as she has it on the insane barking at delivery people, strangers, dog walkers, kids on skateboards, and other barking dogs has ceased.

The downside is that it's fairly large and I hate seeing that big box on her neck. But there is not getting around this. They are all pretty ugly. I tried a smaller one once.

"Melissa & Doug deliver a quality drawing kit to provide a broad range of ages art activities.  Although this kit is a little on the pricey side, it does pack a lot in it:
  50 Sheets Construction Paper
  50 Sheet spiral-top sketch pad
  50 Sheet drawing pad
  12 Non-roll markers
  24 Triangular colored pencils
  10 Jumbo Chalk sticks
  18 Jumbo non-roll crayons  (with carrying case)
  10 Jumbo non-roll fluorescent crayons (with carrying case)

Because all the pencils, markers, crayons, and chalk are not round, they are all non-roll, which makes it easier to prevent scattering and loss under tables, chairs, couches, etc.  The crayons are not the usual brittle self-destructing type, but high quality and long lasting.
The pencils are thicker and easier for young hands to hold.  The carrying cases for the crayons makes it easy to bring them along on trips.

As usual, Melissa & Doug have a product that is designed to last (okay, you will be buying more paper) and keep both parents and children happy.",5.0,0

"I was looking for a comfortable short for camping and outdoor activities. So far these are great! I was pleasantly surprised because it can be risky ordering shorts online because fit can be challenging for all body types. The material of these is nice and breathable. I typically wear a size 10 and went with a Large since I like my shorts on the loose side. These are the exact fit I like; not too short and not too long (they hit just shy of my fingertips and I'm 5'6). The legs openings are nice and wide and not binding. The fit is flattering especially to my thighs. I ordered the purple color and am very pleased. I plan to order another pair. I haven't gotten to test them out in water so I can't attest to their drying abilities yet, but so far I have no complaints!

"I ordered 4 boxes. Three basically had the same commons in all three boxes and there were easily 30-60 of any given card. The 4th box was mostly Blue (cards massively repeated, many over copies) and the rest of the commons were green. The commons were mostly junk commons (no lightning bolts/shocks/wild growth/counterspell type cards). One box came with 2-3 rares. The others had 4 or 5 but they were largely repeated across boxes. Some uncommon came in sets of four to fourteen. (4 of 11 or more copies) Nothing exceptional. I must have enough prodigal sorcerers by now to assure that they could go into every blue deck I will ever make again without ever reusing any of them. Condition was also an issue on more cards than I expected. The patterns of the commons almost made the repeats seem intentional, especially where five different cards would repeat 6-8 times in one section and then again later. All four boxes were underfilled. Don't waste your money or your time. These doesn't even make for a good beginner's collection because it lacks most of Magic's most important commons. No counterspell in four boxes???? Really? Oh and expect about 20 Circles of Protection. They've been printed in a lot of sets. At least there were 6-10 Healing Salves. Oh, and in 4 boxes, 1 Raging Goblin, which has been reprinted so many times it should be in every box. No basic land, so there is that.",1.0,0

"We bought this for our new puppy.  He's a Pyrenees, lab, mastiff mix and he's huge.  We knew we needed to help him learn quickly so that he doesn't accidentally hurt himself or someone when he gets excited.  He's ten months old now and 120 pounds.  This collar has features that I really appreciate.  It has a vibrate and a beep as well as the shock feature.  I've actually only used the shock once and that was when he got out and was running around in the road.  I tried snacks, toys and everything else I could think of.  I was terrified he was going to run in front of a car so after the beep and vibrate didn't work, I used a very light shock.  It scared him and he ran inside.  You can pick the intensity that is used.  I just used a 2.  For other issues, like his crazy barking, we use a beep.  That usually gets him to stop, if he doesn't we use the vibrate feature.  I have the vibrate turned up because he doesn't like it and he knows he needs to stop if he gets buzzed.  The beep works great as an attention getter.  He knows when he hears it that he needs to look at us to see what he needs to do.  I'm very happy that we bought this.  I was completely against a ""shock collar,"" but we really just use the other features on it for training purposes and with some patience and persistence, it has really worked.",5.0,0

"I bought the 8CH 4 camera system for our office.  Our office is all on one level and the width of the office is about 150 feet.  The main NVR unit if located about 80 feet from the farthest camera with only a partial wall between the unit and farthest camera.  Out of the box the system is easy to use. The screen you use to specify the time the cameras should record motion is cumbersome because it is a grid of rectangle 24 (hours) x 7 days and if you make a mistake you cannot uncheck a box and thus need to start over.  The android app for viewing the cameras works well and so does the desktop app.  If you need more than 4 cameras , all you need to do is buy the additional cameras , up to 4 more for a total of 8.  Pairing the camera with the system is easy.  If you need the signal to go through cinder-block walls you may want to consider another system.  I had one camera in our warehouse at about 200 feet away with a cinder block separating the warehouse from the front office NVR.  I got intermittent results in terms of the signal reaching the NVR.  Other reviews I read stated you can replace the antenna's on the cameras to boost the range and signal strength, but the antenna's on my camera do not twist off nor could I pull them off.  These cameras detect motion and it may be helpful to realize that ""motion"" is anything that causes pixels to change.  We were getting false motion alerts because sunlight bouncing off of outside nearby moving traffic was reflecting on a wall and the camera nearby was picking this up.  In terms of ""night vision"" the cameras work best if there is a little bit of light.  If I needed to buy a system for my house I would consider this system.",4.0,0

"This is not my first Barbie Dream House.  In fact, I own this exact same one from about 3 years ago.  The design is the same, but the colors are brighter and the pictures have changed a bit to reflect the movies.

The unit shipped with two parts broken that will require them to replace the entire unit.  We'll see how they handle that and I'll update my review.  It is also missing two pieces.  And when I looked back at my old dreamhouse I found that two things that were broken on this one were broken on that one two and I just never noticed that they were supposed to light up (the fridge light and the fireplace light).

The elevator still doesn't work right.  The cords on both elevators are an inch too short to actually go through the guides, and the clip holding it on at the top comes off every time it is used.  I assume this is a problem with every unit since two units 3 years apart had the problem.

The new hottub doesn't light up like the old one did.  But this isn't a big deal.

The assembly takes about 20 minutes if you are adept at putting things together and reading VERY POOR instructions.  I have assembled thousands of things from toys to furniture to things at work and these are sub-par.  The only real complaint is the sheet of stickers which you have to put on in a very exacting way and which should have been factory applied.  There is no excuse for not simply having the machines that built the house do this step and it means that most of us will have imperfect looking finished products.

None of my dogs will drink the water with even a teaspoon of this added. I keep three huge water bowls through out the house at all times - 6 dogs tend to empty them all at least once a day and twice a day if it's hot. I did two bowls with this added and one plain water. Not one dog would touch the water with the rinse in it. All six went to the untainted water bowl - I had to refill it three times yesterday. This morning I just emptied and scrubbed the other two and refilled with plain water.np Two dogs went right to them.

"I had originally posted a pretty scathing review because of my dissatisfaction with this product. Kooltek promptly contacted me both by replaying here and by e-mail, and offered me a full refund and said that I could keep the cooler. I promised that if I kept it, I would try the product again on another computer I have that is an exact duplicate of the one I first installed it on.

I just got time to do that this weekend, so here is my revised review.

Pros - Cooler installs fairly easily with no modifications to the motherboard. Fan has a cool blue LED.

Cons - Performance is mediocre. I'm not sure it cools any better than my stock cooler, but it does so quieter since it uses a 120 mm fan running at less than half the speed of the small fan on the stock cooler.

I'm using this on an ASUS motherboard with an AM3+ socket. Unlike some coolers, I didn't have to chance the mount and backing plate to install this one. But the mount is cumbersome, requiring you to get fingers down into spots that can be tight to push down on the spring clips.

I wonder if the heat sink compound that came with the cooler is of good quality? I had terrible results with the first installation when I used it, but on the second installation I used some compound that I had purchased awhile back. It seems of better quality.

It does seem to be performing better than the first time, but not as well as I would have hoped. Another cooler I paid only $10 more for dramatically outperforms this one, though it is much harder to install, requiring removing and replacing the mount and backing plate.

I think this cooler needs further refinement to be a viable product. For now, I recommend paying $10 ore and going with a better product.

But kudos to Kooltek for standing behind their product and going the extra mile to make me happy. That went a long way with me.",3.0,0

"I bought the PIF00 primary kit and the extra transmitter for my Shepard. I bought the extra transmitter due to the large yard.
The items (other than the test light) themselves appeared to be quality construction.
When I started putting out the flags, using the test light was hit or miss.  I'd plant a flag then move back and start heading outward again 10 to the side.  In some places the circumference was ok.  On others, it wasn't equidistant from the main unit (I started with the single main unit).  So, when the circle was done, I had a semi circle of flags with some at a different radius than others.  While that would have been ok - the dog would just have a non perfect circle...  However, when I went back to check again, the test light lit up at different radii than the original layout.  Basically, the dog might get zapped at a location today where he was fine yesterday.  Not something I'm willing to risk.
The test light has 2 thin wire contacts that started to bend and in my opinion would eventually break.  I had to wiggle the test light on the collar's contacts to make sure they touched.
Your mileage may vary if you buy and deploy this system.
The return process was smoother than I expected.  So hopefully if you try this product (great system and I may have received a bad test light) and it doesn't work, it's not $600 down the drain.",3.0,0

"Teva's Dozer shoes are, far from the best quality, and I will keep my feet in them for awhile.  I had to replace a pair of shoes that were not the same as these.  They had no arch support, which is a plus for me.  I ordered a half size up, which is a good thing because I'm getting older and having trouble getting shoes to fit.  I'm a 42D, so I'm on my feet all day long, so I don't have to worry about arch support.  I've had these for about a month now, and they're still really comfortable.  I do recommend getting a size up.  It's not just that I like these shoes, I also like the color and the way they look.  I will be buying more pairs of these shoes soon.Love the design of this shoe.  It is pretty.  I wear a 9.5 and I ordered a 9.5.  I normally wear a 9.5 and the 9.5 fit very well.  I have wide feet and this shoe does that.

"I almost loved these shoes...I do really like them.  My 3 year old has wide feet and he really likes slip on ""boat shoes"".  The problems with those shoes are they get stinky and he falls in them.  I looked at alllll the shoes on Amazon and these were my number one choice.  Visually I love the color combination.  The velcro strap fits great and the shoes are easy for him to put on and take off by himself.  He ran like a crazy man the first time he wore them and he was super excited that he didn't fall down!  I feel like much of the comfort comes from the width in addition to the general support provided from the shoe.  My only real complain is that after a week of so the shoes had little fuzzies from the material all over the gray part of the shoe.  I'm sure I could probably pick them off, but I don't have time for that.  They are still great as far a comfort and function, they just lost the new look a bit quicker than I anticipated.  I definitely recommend these shoes for anyone who has a kiddo with wide feet!

"I have a 10 gallon planted tank with some slow eating fish, so I end up overfeeding them to make sure they all get some sustenance. I had an Eheim 2211 and it worked as hard as it could, but it just wasn't cutting it, and it was an enormous hassle to prime it whenever it needed cleaning - and it needed cleaning constantly, because I was asking it to do too much. I knew I needed a bigger filter and as soon as I realized the Ecco was self-priming, I was sold.

Some key differences between the Ecco and the Classic:
1. The priming pump - huge key. I didn't find the plastic handle to be too flimsy, but I was also gentle with it after having read reviews. It primes so quickly and I don't have to worry about swallowing aquarium water!
2. There's only one nozzle on each tube that controls the flow rate, when on the Classic there was two. For me, this is just easier - less connections mean less possibility for leaks, and I only need one nozzle to control the flow rate anyway.
3. It is so much quieter. Maybe it's because I upgraded the size of the filter so much so it's working less, but I'm amazed that a filter so much bigger is so much quieter. It makes NO noise, it's actually incredible.

So all in all: powerful, quiet, easy to set up and easy to maintain. I'm so happy with it.",5.0,0

"This was my first ever quadcopter and I pretty much was sure I would destroy it very quickly after opening it. I'm pretty blown away by this little beast because a) it flies really smoothly and is relatively easy to control, even for a beginner like me. and b) it takes a lickin and keeps on ticking! I've been flying this thing for about a week non-stop now with at least 3-4 total hours of flight time logged so far.

My students LOVED this activity set.  It was in my small group centers for a couple of weeks.  They kept asking for it.  There were a lot of things that they liked about it.  They loved that they were like puzzles, especially since the mats are the shapes of bugs.  The boys especially loved this fact.  My students loved how brightly colored the shapes were and that there were many different shapes to play with.

As a teacher, there were many things I liked about the Shapes Dont Bug Me Geometry Activity Set.  I loved the variety of shapes that are included.  I really like that the shapes are transparent.  This way the students can easily see if they have placed the shape correctly.

I really loved the variety of activities on the cards.  Some of the activities on the cards are placing the shape where it goes, combining shapes to make other shapes, and sorting the shapes by similar and different attributes.  These are things tShapes Don't Bug Me Collagehat students are required to learn in the kindergarten core curriculum.

Most of all, I loved that my students loved to play with them.  I loved that the students were having fun but were learning as well!

"This is a good dog-seat solution.

PROS: My 11 pound mini pinscher fits perfectly into it - it is big enough for her to lie down too. The seat can be hung high enough for her to look out the window, or set low (almost on the car seat) for extra stability. The fact that the upper straps are attached to the frame halfway along the side walls and not at the very front means that the full space of the box is available to the dog (i.e. the front wall doesn't cave in).  The clip attaches to the god collar or harness and is adjustable in length. The cover is removable and washable.

CONS: the frame is metal and the cover very thin, so there is no padding whatsoever if the dog falls against the side of the box or wants to rest her head on the rim. For some strange reason the short strap that clips onto the dog collar/harness is not looped in/permanently attached, i.e. if you try lengthen that strap to the maximum to give your dog more freedom of movement it simply comes out and you have to maneuver it back in. It also came with a HUGE (and I mean huge) clip for attaching to the dog collar/harness, so i had to replace it with a smaller one.

TIP: The floor does occasionally tip back, especially if the car seatback to which it is attached is tilted back slightly. The more upright you make the back of the car seat, the better the box hangs horizontally.",4.0,0

I have a mITX from CyberpowerPC and my GTX 980 Ti would reach 83-84C under load (Assassin's Creed Syndicate, Furmark, etc).
Now under full load and a hefty +400 core over clock and +600 memory core OC, it runs at 50C. If that's not amazing, then I don't know what is.

"My daughter loves Rainbow Dash and Play Doh, so I thought this would be a great toy for her, but I'm disappointed with it. In the box, you get the Rainbow Dash, a pair of dough scissors, and 6 very tiny cans of Play Doh in purple, pink, green, yellow, blue, and orange. I did like that the Rainbow Dash has molds built onto it, but they are very hard to get the dough out of, such is the case of the dough extruder on the top of Rainbow Dash's head.

The problem with the extruder is that you can't fit that much dough into the hole and when you push down, the door keeps popping open and when the ""hair"" comes out, it isn't in a continuous flow because you have to keep stopping to add more dough, so it ends up breaking off. Pretty much a bummer for my daughter and we rarely use it. I do really like the scissors and we use them even without the pony and can use the raised designs on them to make impressions in the dough. I also wish that the dough cans it came with were larger because once you mix the colors in the extruder for the hair, it eventually turns an ugly dark color from repeated use of the dough. Lastly, the wings keep falling off of the pony. The idea of the pony is cool, but the execution is quite flawed.",2.0,0

"I'd tried flying helis years ago and didn't have a great experience. I was not interested in spending a majority of my time fixing things when I would have rather been out flying. This little guy flew great out of the box. I will say however that you need to make sure you check this heli out before flying it. I found a blade grip screw that needed a little tightening and one of the pitch rod links was out of its slot on the rotor head. As with any heli, it should always be checked out before its first flight and never assumed the manufacturer has done everything correctly out of the box.

The V977 is responsive and does what you ask of it. Sure its a little quirky. You constantly have to be mindful of the throttle and it doesn't take much wind to blow this guy around. Now granted I've only flown in 6G mode and I'm more of a beginner/intermediate pilot. This is a great heli for taking to the park and practicing hovering in all orientations, pirouettes, circles and figure eights. I can't speak for 3D as I don't know how to yet. The manual is of course written in Chinglish. I had to get most of the instructions from youtube vids. Just make sure your throttle hold is off, your idle up is off and throttle stick all the down before turning on the tx - the rest you can get from youtube.

Make note this is not a throw away heli after a couple of flights, otherwise known as an Airhog or something similar. You can actually buy spare parts for this guy. However, ironic as it is, the heli does take quite a beating. I highly recommend someone new to the RC Heli hobby start with this particular copter, or just stick to micro helis starting out. Get a lot of practice on a sim (FS One, Phoenix, Real Flight, Accu-Sim, X-Heli or whatever), and then take what you learned outdoors without having to worry about dumping an expensive first helicopter.",4.0,0

"Keyboard cover review

I bought this in grey to protect the keys of my 2017 MBA. Not from liquid spills; this would only offer protection from light splashes, not a full spill. But from dust and crumbs.

The fit is really good, it lines up perfectly. It doesnt touch or damage the screen when the laptop is closed. Typing is harder, you have to press the keys harder and its a matte, somewhat tacky finish on the keyboard cover. This means traveling around the keyboard takes some getting used to. My only gripe is that the MacBook keyboard backlighting is seriously encumbered by this cover. The cover is not transparent where the characters on each key are labeled, meaning the light doesnt shine through. The only light you get is around each key. In a dim or dark area, its no good for seeing the keys.

I like having the cover. I like how super thin it is and the protection it offers. Typing with any keyboard cover requires some getting used to. I really wish the letters and number on each key were illuminated, thats my only complaint.",5.0,0

"I'm a fairly particular with my can selection, within a budget.  I listen to music on my cans everyday and these headphones sound better the older they get.  I've had them for over 2 years now.  There was a break in period of about 50 hours. They replaced a pair of Sennheiser 595.  They are very different from the Senns, (which are great headphones as well, just a brighter sound.)  The one caveat is that they are difficult to drive and a headphone amp takes care of that nicely.  I listen to all types of music, but my headphone time tends to be Jazz and vocals and the AKG's don't disappoint.  Also, if you have a large head, as I do:)  you should be careful with these.  They fit, but barely.  Happy listening.",4.0,0
"I initially had high hopes for this product.  I have an HTPC with Windows Media Center that has built in Hauppauge tuners (one PCI single, 1500 series I think, and a dual PCIEx1 2250 model).  I was thinking that eventually, I'd be able to not be stuck with routing coax cables to the computer, and be able to access the tuner content over the network.  It worked pretty well for about 10 months.

The first one didn't work and after a hassle-free Amazon return, the second one broke after about 10 months.  The cooling fan stopped working and it was so hot to the touch, it was making my closet smell like burnt electronics.  I'm surprised it didn't catch on fire (not sure if it is UL listed or not.)  And like most warranties, you have to send it to the manufacturer and pay the shipping.  Yawn.  I guess I could have bought a new one and send the old one back, but that is somewhat unethical, and I didn't want to risk a house fire anyway, so at this point, I don't think you could pay me to take one.

The cooling fan in this unit is very loud, so it would need to be tucked away and not in the main viewing area.

On the other hand the Hauppauge tuners have performed flawlessly for probably about 5 years.  As a bonus, the Hauppauge also acts as my IR input to my computer which enables easy integration with Evenghost for automation with my Harmony remotes.  As a con, it seems the Hauppauge dual tuner has the worst signal, the single has slightly better, and the HDHomeRun had the best.  So if Hauppauge could better manage the ATSC signal in the tuner, there would be a clear winner there.  But even so, low heat, no noise, and flawless operation over 5 years is a large upside.

Bottom line, I will not purchase or consider this unit again.",2.0,0

"You know, I have invested in quite a few very expensive ear buds in the past.  They sounded great, but invariably broke.  One or the other ear bud would just stop working.  I primarily use them to listen to audiobooks at the gym - lifting weights and riding the stationary bike.  SoI was never especially tough on my phones.

I finally got tired of paying a lot of money for products that weren't durable and didn't last. I bought these because they were inexpensive, and had a control on the cable to stop play if someone spoke to me.

Well, whaddah ya know!? They sounded almost as good, and they seem to be lasting longer.  This is actually my second pair.  I had bought them before, and was happy with them, but dropped my ipod one day and bent the phone plug.  After that, it didn't fit quite well, and I'd get static whenever I moved.  Bought a second pair, and they are great.

I use these with my iPhone as well on occasion, and they're fine for that use as well.  No one seems to have any problem hearing me, and I have no issue hearing and understanding them.  In fact, they sound quite good.

So, for either casual listening at the gym, or talking on your cell phone, I'd recommend these phones.  They are decent at excluding outside noise, though I haven't been able to get quite as good a fit as I had on some of the higher priced phones.  But I don't think the cost differential was anywhere near worth the slightly better sound isolation.",5.0,0

"I'm not the best at doing any kind of organized crafts with my children. My style is more along the lines of giving them art supplies and letting them create what they want, and honestly, that's what I'll always prefer for them. They really enjoy projects that have a somewhat defined end result sometimes, though, and so it's kits like this that come to my rescue. Thankfully, they still get to be a bit creative with these projects, and while end results might look similar for many children, they probably won't look just alike.

There are 16 projects within this box, with lots and lots of little pieces. There are only instructions for 5 of the projects, but really, with those instructions, you can easily figure out the rest of them. I would have preferred for each of the projects to have been individually packaged to make things easier. I have had kits like that, and they make things a breeze for this disorganized mama. This kit does need a bit more organization on my part, but it's really not that bad. The supplies are all separated into different bags, and there are even extra bags for me to divide out some of the supplies. I could turn my children loose with everything and see what they come up with, but I prefer separating each project(at least for the most part), so that my children can choose which one they want to do, and not worry about running out of supplies before all the project are finished. Between my 3 children, I'll get 5 rainy days out of this box, with one extra. (I can't beat that!) ;) Plus, the included finger crayons can be used after all the projects are finished.

They have an elastic band, as well as a drawstring, so they fit a variety of sizes.  I personally think that the long sleeve t-shirt is a stylish choice for the younger male that doesn't want to wear a matching button up pajama top in the same print and it's a heavier material than a regular t-shirt.

I'm going to pick up another pair, most likely in the other color that's available, because they're such a great deal at this price and the fit is true to size.

"As others have said, they are a bit tinny, however, for my relatively simple needs, they're fine. I got them to replace an old pair of speakers for my desktop. They're even adequate for music for non-serious listeners, but the bass, as has been said, almost disappears. I also wanted something relatively small, due to limited desktop space, and these certainly are---the other speakers certainly weren't huge, but these really do give me some extra space. Lastly, as has also been said, the instructions talk about two cables, a green and a pink, which is usually for input with a microphone. However, there's only the green cable, which is fine. Plug it into the input jack, plug the normal size power cord into an outlet, and you're good to go. (The fact that it's a standard 2 prong plug, rather than a large brick like my old speakers, was a further bonus. )

"Installed this in a split level 1960's era home that has a combination of old 2 wire (non grounded) wiring, and remodeled sections with 3 wire (grounded) wiring. Router is upstairs, and I wanted to hook up an ""Apple TV"", and TiVo downstairs using the Powerline XE104 to cut down on wireless signals that were interfering with my LG Home Theater System's wireless rear speakers and subwoofer (caused annoying sound fade in and out).
  Wiring involved was all in 2 wire part of the house, but on a different circuits. Was able to get an immediate ""downstream"" signal and internet connection going through a 6 outlet (wall) surge protector at the Router end, but only got .5 Mbps throughput speeds downstream (testing speed with laptop and online speed test). Removed the surge protector (as Instructions state), and speed went up to same speed as when the laptop is directly connected to my Netgear (Wireless N) Router. This product is rated at 85 Mbps, but obviously not getting that from my ISP (15 Mbps max.). No need to get Netgear's faster products (200 or 500 Mbps) if you're not getting a lot more than 85 Mbps input from your ISP, right?
  Movie streaming speed to Apple TV is good. Will probably connect the LG BluRay player up too (which can also stream Netflix or Vudu movies wirelessly) once I get a longer Ethernet cable (now using Wireless N with good results).
  One other note: Those that are saying they get two 4 port units must be getting re-packaged or a mis-packaged Kit, as Netgear's specs for the ""XEB1004-100NAS  4-port Powerline 85 Adapter Kit"" specifically states one unit has one ethernet port, and only the receiving unit has 4 ports.

"I have two miniature pinchers who will be 2 YO in Sept 2014.  I got them in December of 2012; they were about 12 weeks.  That first Winter one of the pups had a bad back knee that tended to go out when she put pressure on it. When it did it obviously hurt, since she gave out a yelp..  So, she decided to stop climbing stairs.  Thinking she might need ACL surgery, I took her to a vet well known for that.  He said, nope not her ligament: bad joint (thin collagen). And he said it was a breed characteristic.  He prescribed this supplement.  Took care of it pretty quick and soon she was bounding up and down the stairs, jumping on and off the sofa and when she was tall enough, my bed.  Since the vet said bad knees are a breed characteristic, I have both dogs on a half pill a day.  The pain went away fairly quick, maybe a couple of weeks.  I keep them on it hoping to stave off arthritis in their later years.  And, best of all, they think it is a treat!  UPDATE:  As of Jan 2015 both girls no longer pups are still doing great.  They think this is a treat when they come back in the house. I still give them each half a pill/day.",5.0,0

"I bought one of these last year and it was great, little or no static or interference. This one transmits especially well. You can't go wrong for [...].
One major problem with it is the wire. Be careful with it!
When you connect it to your power outlet be careful not to pinch or pull on the wire especially if your power outlet is recessed in the dashboard. It'll become detached and you'll end up having one channel go out. You can play with it and have both channels work but eventually it'll fail totally.
Also the wire protrudes out of the left side of the unit. If you want to keep your player in your lap while driving ok but if you keep it anywhere else this will cause the wire to become pinched.
A good idea with this unit would be to plug it in vertically or sideways or even upside down so as not to pinch or pull on the wire. Make sure there's no tension on it. The looser the better. It'll last longer that way.
I really like this transmitter and bought another after my first one suffered the pinched wire fate after a year.

"I am familiar with shapewear, having worn other brands for years.  I have mainly used Maidenform in the past, however their smallest size I can find is a small, and I need something smaller at this point.

I am 5'6"" and weight 152lbs currently, and I ordered this Vedette body suit in a Small.  I am pleased with the fit.  Yes, you have to work to get it on.  But that's the mark of good shapewear.  I chose to move to Vedette because they have several smaller sizes once I lose additional weight.  My natural measurements are currently 38-30-38.  In my small Maidenform I am 37-29-38. In my new size small Vedette I am 37 - 27.5 - 38.5.  I was actually surprised that it made my hip/butt measurement larger.  I can definitely tell that it lifts everything up, and my jeans were more filled out.

The Vedette is a much thicker material.  Especially in the stomach.  The material does not breathe really at all, so your skin will sweat if you wear this for 12 hours.  I didn't realize I was sweating until I took it off this evening, and my skin was damp beneath the body suit.  The body suit itself was not damp, so I was surprised.  But this did not bother me, and hopefully it will aid in losing inches.  I was able to wear this comfortably all day beneath my jeans and shirt to my office job and driving to several appointments.  It was comfortable, and I could tell that it was providing more compression than my Maidenform ever did.  I am excited about the upgrade.",5.0,0

I was a little unsure about the sizing based on the chart but I am 5'6 and 160 lbs and a medium fits me fine. The fleece is high quality and slightly stiff, it feels almost like a wool.

I wanted something loose-ish to sleep in, bought lgt gray, not usually forgiving color. I thought these not only fit perfect but also look cute enough to wear out. They are about mid-rise, with wide waistband. You could pull it down for a lower rise pant. I haven't actually worn them, I know people say drawstring is decorative only.

"This is a generous portion of cat food with a lot of higher quality ingredients compared to other types of cat food. Primarily, the first ingredient is actual chicken and it includes taurine. It also does not include grains of any kind and, as anyone knows about cat nutrition, grains are not a part of anything a cat needs in its diet. They are junk food and fillers so the primary selling point of this product is that it provides what your cat needs to be healthy without things which it does not need or that can damage its health. So, I'm very pleased with the ingredients list for this product, though I will note that one pays a premium price for the quality.

I can't speak to whether or not the nutrition is as good as the ingredients list indicate it should be, but I can say my cat throws up less after eating this than some other types of food. I can also say that she tends to rapidly lose interest in dry food that I feed her and has held interest in this longer than other types of dry food. I don't know if she's finding it more appetizing (possible, since it has a strong smell and she seems to like stronger smelling food) or if not having digestive issues after eating it makes her favor it.

In terms of value, if my cat continues to eat this up over time, I will keep buying it because, though it may be more expensive, if she will actually eat all of it and I don't have to throw out uneaten food, it'll save me money in the long run.",5.0,0

I consider myself more then just a novice when in comes to the ins and outs of installing hardware and software.  But this one has so far managed to elude me.  I have an Asus P6T v1 and needed the SATA III along with the RAID capability.  I might note that my MB has two onboard RAUD controllers one of which is in use.  After about 26hrs straight of messing around with this thing I am positive there is some setting that I can't find or change that allows me to have both the RAID card and the onboard RIAD running at the same time.  I was able to get the RAID card to install and even managed a RAID0 config with windows installed.  But for some reason I am no longer able to get back into that windows config.

"My cat needed lysine - but she didn't like it in any form (capsule mixed into her food, gel, chew).  This one was the best - she will eat it sometimes, if I break it into 2-3 pieces, unlike the vet's chews, which cost a good deal more and were completely rejected.  This one is a little softer, and the smell appears to be better, from my cat's reaction, so it's a partial success.

Update:  (July 12)  She no longer will eat it, and the negative review regarding Consumer Labs' findings about this supplement convinced me not to try to persuade her...sometimes my cats have a good sense of what is healthy for them (or maybe she just doesn't like the taste/smell that much).",3.0,0

"These boys pajamas are great for my toddler son now that the summer heat is approaching us quickly. These pajamas are made of 100% cotton and wash nicely. They are not the softest pajamas I have purchased for him, but after a couple washes/dries they have already gained a more comfortable feel. They're nice and lightweight for the summer heat. I purchased size 3T for my 34"", 30 pound 18 month old and they fit great with some room to grow in. He typically wears 2T-3T in clothing, so I'd say these are true to size. The shirt is long and narrow - it has a nice fit on my son. I like that this shirt is tag less - my kiddo often tugs at shirts with tags, as his skin is quite sensitive. The shorts come down to his knees and are a ""fitted"" style but a little loose on my boy. I like that in pjs - I feel that would be more comfortable during his sleep. My son enjoys wearing his new pjs and actually pulled them out of his pajama draw to wear when it was time to get ready for bed. He approves!

"My 1 yr old son received this as a gift. Wish I wouldn't have tossed the box so we could return it! It collapses to easily (just while playing), the gears do not stay on- as soon as you turn either on the end they ALL pop off, and the nails pretty much fall right into the holes. If you are looking for a toy for your little boy (or girl ) to tinker around with I highly suggest the LeapFrog Fix and Learn Speedy. The drivers are a wrench and screw driver that are very toddler friendly to grasp and 'work' with, cutesy (not annoying) songs, it cues when something on Speedy breaks and needs some fixing and of course doubles as a race car. Speedy gets played with daily by my son (which says a lot for a toy). If you have a toddler that is more interested in tinkering rather than necessarily playing (like my little guy), check out Speedy, NOT this workbench!",2.0,0
"my son is 34 months, i order 1~2 years old and it fits him very well.
costume is well made, I had like to give it a 5 star but the only reason I gave 4 stars is due to the belt.
I am no saying it is bad, but they could have made it a bit better which fits completely round the waist.
This belt is attach to the costume and is only for the front half, if they had made it for the full waist it would have fitted better.
Anyways, I would be removing it as I have purchased another belt on Amazon (Batman The Dark Knight Costume Belt - Child by Rubies) which is adjustable and look's great. I will suggest everyone to get this belt with the costume, it goes really well.",4.0,0

"I am probably not the most qualified person on Amazon to write a review on headphones/ear buds, but with that said, I LOVE THESE! Since my children are kleptomaniacs regarding anything electronic that Mom has, I only buy the super cheap headphones - the ones available at the gas station, costing $1-2. This cheapness keeps me from losing it when my earphones ""disappear"" several times a week. I was getting a few other things on Amazon and decided to try these. and guess what? THEY ARE AWESOME! I love how they cancel outside noise and kind of create a seal in your ears. I love how you can distinguish between '80s rock and classic country with these. (Most of the earphones I've had made Johnny Cash sound like Axl Rose. ) I am truly surprised at how clear these make music sound and how well I can actually understand podcasts and comedy now. It's like going from an 8-track to a CD - yep, there is that much of a difference. I am now a Gummy convert and will only use these. I have purchased an extra pair and I keep them well hidden. Bottom Line: These are fantastic ear buds, especially for the price. The incredible sound these provide make walking the dogs a true joy - allowing me to disappear into a cloud of loud, clear music, piped comfortably into the hearing holes on each side of my head. and keeps out the interruptions caused by a bunch of extraneous noise. You absolutely cannot go wrong with these - and their low price just elevates them to perfection.",5.0,0
"This is a great clipper for the price. I got this clipper from Walmart for $45.00. Amazon had it for 64.00. Usually Amazon is cheaper. However I like the clipper. It did cut my dog (poodle) very well. I guess I can not say great because I had a Laube clipper and it was amazing. However at this time I could not afford it. I also ordered another clipper that cost a lot more money then this one and I returned it because it was to big and too bulky.

I kept looking at a lot of reviews and came upon this Wahl. The reviews of this item was amazing for the price. It is lite like my previous clipper. It did cut very well. The combs that come with it does pull somewhat but still works very well. One thing too that no one mentioned before is the blade does pop off so you can clean the blade. Just remember that it is so important to keep the blades cleaned and oiled. That is the life of the clipper. I really did not keep my previous clipper maintained like it should have. If I did I would not have to have bought  another clipper right now.

I am not new to cutting my poodle. I have been doing it for a little over 2 years so I have got pretty good at it and pulling hair out of ears, squeezing anal glands, cutting under the pads,and cleaning teeth. There is just so much more to clipping a dog.... I would buy it again",4.0,0

"Max finally killed Captain Kurklops. The last of his stuffing was in my hallway when I came home yesterday. He now happily carries around the rag wherever he goes.

This and Polly pig were his first set of Tuffy brand toys. Polly pig is still going strong a month later, minus one of her ears.

When we first got this toy, Max, an 8 month old pit puppy, managed to rip both of them within the first 10 minutes. However, after the initial tears, he managed to slow down with the toy destruction.

Kurklops has a body squeaker and one at the tip of each tentacle. Max ripped the squeakers out of each tentacle before working on the body. What is nice is that each limb is a separate stitched compartment so that by ripping out the stuffing in one part of the toy, he isn't able to take out all the stuffing in one shot.

This toy is NOT meant for a serious game of tug of war. It's my dog's favorite game and he tore off a tentacle during our first and only game of tug. However its perfectly suited for indoor games of catch.",4.0,0
"The Midwest caper is the first soft crate I've ever owned and I love it, I've used it at MANY dog shows and other events over the years.  I own both the Midwest camper and now the Noz-To-noz soft crate.  I LOVE the Midwest camper because the zippers are SO strong, they have NEVER been stuck, I have long hair dogs and the fur never bothers the zippers (I wish I can say the same about the noz-to-noz zippers).  The thing I don't like about the Midwest Camper is that it's very hard to wash out the inside and to drip dry.  It does not have bottom suports so you can't just hose off the inside and stand it up to dry.  My dogs get very muddy after swimming and having to wash out the camper was too much trouble.  This is why I got the Noz-to-Noz.  But I do love the Midwest camper for how strong it's made and it's really held up well over the years of very heavy use.",4.0,0

.I ordered the Med to give me more coverage But when I tried it on it WAS a little too big around by 1 inch and the straps are too long by 2 inches
I'm going to do the alteration on it and it will fit perfect. I guess I got the bigger size for a couple of  reasons:
I thought it would be too short and I didn't want to take a chance it would be too snug

I guess I could have ordered the small But I think the cup size would have been slightly too small? Well they can't make every body type I guess.lol
over all I really love  this Tankini. I like how there's a seam under the bust and pleats down the middle Bust to give support and the fabric gives good support too. The way the straps and cups are designed,gives the suit good coverage for a fuller cup size.

I took her to a large social event today where hundreds of children and parents were present-- the harness seemed to keep her from jumping up (something that she frequently does)  and I really liked the fact that when I did correct her for not heeling at my side she responded well from the harness pressure and I didn't feel like it was hurting her.  The product seems well made, but again I've only used it once. I was torn between ordering a s/m verses a med. She is currently 30 pounds and has a petite build. I ended up purchasing the medium.

"I am not reviewing the game. It's the same Chutes and Ladders it's always been. Rather insipid for anyone over the age of 6, I'd say. No strategy, just counting.

What I will review is the board, graphics, and pieces. This is a 70's retro design. I haven't played the 70's version (or at least haven't in 30 years or more), so I can't comment on the accuracy. I did like the pictures - they show little morality tales. Hard-working children who do nice things are at the bottom of each ladder, and are rewarded at the top for their labors. Lazy or mean kids are at the top of each chute, and get heir comeuppance at the bottom. My son (who is 4) enjoyed looking at each pairing and discussing how and why they succeeded or failed.

That said, the board is rather busy, and it isn't entirely clear to a younger person which square corresponds to which chute or ladder.

The game pieces are sturdy, though the plastic brackets are difficult for little fingers to insert the cardboard children into. The spinner works well once you punch it through. Spinning action is easy and can go for more than a few seconds.

All in all, it's the same boring game it's always been. This retro edition offers some nice additional fun, but is rather busy compared to a more clean modern design.",4.0,0
"Viperine is daughter of Stheno, gorgon sister of Medusa and Euryale. She is Deuces cousin. She is Beautiful!! Her hair is platinum blonde/ white and is layered over a bunch of snakes that are embedded in her head. Her headband is removable yet it is connected to her head leaving a hole if taken off. She wears a loose fitted dress which exemplifies her hippie boho chic style. On her feet are detailed boots which have little fangs on them. Viperine's body is very reptilian, similar to Jinafires yet also very different. Her accessories include a make-up palette, make-up brush, make-up box, hair brush and diary.

Like I said, my daughter takes her pups everywhere and sleeps with them each night. She has had this pup for almost a year and it is still holding up great! She's pretty dirty, but with a little cleaning she looks as good as new. I always spot clean her with a little water. I am impressed with the quality of the materials. I am shocked that they have not gotten holes! This makes the price a little more worth it!

"This review is for the charger purchased for a Samsung Galaxy S6. I am very very happy with this purchase, and cannot believe I didn't have this cable before! Like most people, I was using the charger that came with my phone which had frayed beyond belief in the 8 or 9 months that I have had it. Not sure why Samsung doesn't make more durable cables, but I guess they bank on the fact that you'll need to buy a new charger every year or so. But I digress. So my current charger was basically frayed in the section right where it connects to the phone part, so there was a 'particular' way you had to lay the phone for it to properly charge. This left many situations where the phone was plugged in all night, but it wasn't actually charging because the cable wasn't lying in the right position. Annoying, right?
So I was browsing Amazon in it's splendid glory late one night, as I've come to do recently, and decided to order this. Was pleasantly suprised! These are some durable cables! They don't seem flimsy, even at the USB and plug-in part. And the cable is loooooong. How was I tethered to the short, 1 ft charger all this time?
I really feel like I've been living under a rock, because this seems to solve all the problems of the original charger all at once!
 I like that there's a three-pack because, let's be real, my husbands charger is in no better state. And most importantly, because I'm sure this is an issue for many people, it doesn't seem to take longer to charge the phone. Now I haven't done an actual timing of it, but it seemed to take the same amount of time for me. And again, if the cable is in good shape and not finicky, there's less chance that it's just plugged in and not actually charging. I am very happy and will re-purchase these if they ever get destroyed. although whatever would destroy these would likely take the phone with it.",5.0,0
"This playset is adorable & definitely playable. If you have a Littlest Pet Shop fan in the family, he or she will love it. My younger daughters are in their early teens now, but have been collecting & playing with Littlest Pet Shop for around 7 years now. They really like this set and are interested in collecting the other Style Set rooms. I like how the Style Sets stack so that they're playable but don't take up as much room. My daughters love to play the LPS app on their Kindles so getting more animals to add is a huge plus for them. Their previous LPS toys coordinate nicely with this set too. What I like is that it can all be stored away in a labeled plastic bin with a lid (I use a clear medium sized Rubbermaid bin), so nothing gets lost.

The one detractor of this set in my eyes, is that it's a little overpriced. Unfortunately most of the LPS toys tend to be overpriced when first released. I usually wait until they go on sale.",4.0,0

"Let's cut to the important part - this product works, and works well.  The litter stays perfectly clean and raked, and I only need to empty the waste bin (easy when you use a grocery bag as a liner) once a week or so.

That's the good part.  The bad part is it's been relentlessly unreliable.  It will jam if you put even slightly too much litter in it.  I've had burned out motors, squeaky conveyors, and busted sensors.  I've disassembled and reassembled it countless times.  That being said, it's a simple machine, and some basic mechanical inclination will allow one to service this accordingly.

My first unit was missing a few minor, non-critical parts, and the motor burned out after a month or so, making a squealing noise from day one that made my cat afraid to use it.  I had disassembled, lubricated, and reassembled multiple times.

I contacted PetSafe, which was awesome.  They sent me an entirely new unit without asking me to return the old unit, so I officially had a new one with an old one for parts.  Since replacing the unit with the new one, it's still been slightly finnicky, but notably better than the old one.  I've still had to make a few repairs, but again, for someone with basical mechanical aptitude, it's not hard.

So yes, it's been less than reliable, but my wife and I love it, and we can't imagine going back to scooping again.  I'd have to say, if this replacement one fails, I'll be happy to replace it with the same unit.",4.0,0

I've bought severeal WowWee products over the years including the Robosapien and the Roboraptor.  This is the first one that I had to download an app to fully appreciate-- It says in the product information that it works without the app but given the limitations I'm not sure that I would buy this without access to either an ipad or a smart phone.  My ipad is a bit outdated and the app would not download to it, so I downloaded it to my Samsung III phone which worked ok. I think this is the oldest Samsung that it would work with by the way.

Like all of the WowWee products I have bought it does not come with a battery so I had to supply them.  It also has a compartment for the batteries that requires a tiny screw driver. I don't know if they plan to upgrade the app but it doesn't do a lot of different things-- makes noises, the face on the screen changes, and it can run through a simple routine of turns and straight movements.

New batteries in controller and fully charged in drone. I checked everything, no damage. Continued to fly until battery ran down every thing was ok. Took it out tonight, paired ok got it up 10 off ground everything ok so i landed it. Too it out to my driveway, pushed video button and  then pushed one button take off, it goes up and up and up, I had no control working of any kind it went up about 40 feet and drifted into a tree about 70 feet away and now my drones stuck in a tree 40 feet in the air. No way to get it down, thats too bad it only flew well a few times. By the way I'm not new to drones, I have three others that work fine.

"I cannot explain how incredibly fantastic it is to have the love of my life (my little Buddy) tucked safely away in his sleepypod while driving. He used to love to sit behind my neck, draping himself over my shoulder.  Cute? Yes. Safe? No! How could I forgive myself if we had an accident and he went flying? I adore him, and even though it took about three days for him to accept being in here, it's worth it. I would buy this again and again and again.

Bottom line: Yes, it's awesome to have our puppies out and about while traveling, but it only takes one strong hit of the brakes to send them flying, and they will perish. Not worth it.  Watch the crash tests on this item. It passes. It is sturdy, comfortable, and uses the strength and safety of your car's seat belts to keep your pet as safe as possible.",5.0,0
"I've used this battery on a D50, D80 and D200. I bought 2 EN-EL3e's because most of my Nikon bodies provide very conservative battery power readings. If you are a Nikon user, you'll probably realize that Nikon has geared their Nikon digital camera bodies with memory card space and battery power meter with a ""glass is half empty"" approach. I was doing a shoot with my D80 and I thought I had a defective EN-EL3e because after 200 shots, the battery meter stated I had 44% battery power left. I ended up shooting well over 1000 shots and the meter was flickering from 30% to 60%. The same behaviour happened with my D50 and D200. Bottom line, Nikon's digital camera bodies have very inaccurate battery level meters. The EN-EL3e has a TON of juice on 1 charge and I am very pleased with it.",5.0,0

"As you can see from the photo, this bra is nothing special as far as looks go. It's not the bra that I would wear under my t-shirts when I'm out and about (because it doesn't flatter me as much as my favorite underwires), but it's great for giving me much-needed support when I'm home taking it easy and it's a great value for the price. A lot of women prefer to go braless at home, but, if you're like me and want/need support during all waking hours, this may very well be the bra for you. The wide under-band doesn't provide as much support as my Bali underwires but I found it to be adequate. I guess you can say that it strikes a happy medium between industrial strength support and going braless. I ordered this bra at the lower end of my regular band size - in other words, I generally wear a 38 or a 40 so I chose the 38 - because I figured that it should fit snug in order to be supportive. Once I got the bra and tried it on, I was glad I ordered that way because I'm sure it's going to stretch out a bit over time and, by ordering snug, I'll get better support for a longer period of time. I ordered it in my regular cup size and that worked out fine. The shoulder straps are comfortable and the hooks are strong and secure. I don't usually order bras online unless I am already familiar with the fit, but I went into this purchase with the idea that it was going to function as a house bra and I was not too concerned with how it looks; I just wanted one that doesn't have wires and feels nice and comfortable with just enough support. ALL OF THIS SAID, your results may vary of course!",5.0,0

I am completly convinced this unti has lowered my scores by 2 or 3 strokes a round and has speeded up my rounds by at least 15 minutes. I regularly update both software and courses with no problems.

"Great product at first, but degrades over time.  This product is super easy to install.  It's literally plug and play.  The speeds it provides is meh.  I have a 75MBPS connection but only about 30MBPS gets through on this adapter.  Other powerline adapters keep me on much higher speeds.  After a few months, the adapter would lose connection for about a minute every so often.  As more time went by, it'd get worst and worst eventually leading me to abandon it all together.  It wasn't THAT bad, but two or three times a day was more than enough for me to give it up.",3.0,0
"Like many other reviewers, I can confidently rate this tablet with at least 4 stars...provided you're a geek who is comfortable rooting your devices and installing new ROMs. As nearly anyone who has used this tablet will tell you, out of the box it's complete crap. How Viewsonic managed to so badly mangle the operating system is beyond me. But...spend just a couple minutes on the xda forums to find the instructions for how to root, spend another couple of minutes performing the root and ROM installation (and, for extra credit, install the Pershoot kernel), and you'll have a tablet that is lightening quick and capable.

I am currently running the latest VEGAn ROM (Gingerbread flavored) with the Pershoot kernel overclocked to 1.4 GHz. With a couple of battery-draining apks (applications) deleted, I'm still seeing amazing battery life and applications launch immediately.

A couple of notes if you're one of those people who has been slobbering after the latest ""fruity"" tablet... This ain't no iPad. But that's only because the Android OS is still transforming from it's caterpillar form into the beautiful butterfly it will become. You'll trade ""pretty"" for ""powerful"" since a rooted tablet like this one will give you full access to all of the amazing (and often experimental) apps in the Android Market.

Another ding: accessories. I picked up the USB keyboard/case for this device on amazon (for about $25) and love it. It adds amazing functionality with complete plug-and-play ability. But...that's about the *only* case you'll find for it besides the generic sleeves for 10"" tablets (I also got one of those).

I would be remiss if I didn't mention that the dreaded poor viewing angle for the screen often annoys me. It's true that you could potentially claim this is a ""privacy"" feature, but don't be fooled. I've often had to tweak the angle to get a comfortable non-eye-strain producing view of the screen for long periods.

Lastly, the front-facing camera (the only one) stinks. But, at a price half to a third of similar tablets on the market, I'm OK with that and the other limitations I mentioned.",4.0,0

"Pluses: The base appears to be strong, well designed, and well made.  The armature is also strong and adequately rigid.  The adjustment is reasonably easy and keeps it's place without causing damage to the armature. And, the bolt at the top of the armature is strong and rigid.
Minus:  The corded loop does not hold without risking strangling.  I would much prefer something that was adjustable and had a break-away connector to assure that it would not injure my dog(s) if they became desperate to escape the grooming table.  I am currently looking for a replacement for the loop.
All said, I would buy this product again for my 65 pound poodle, especially after her matures enough to stand more steadily for grooming.

This is simple and convenient to just have on your nightstand or side table; the power cord being so long is a plus too.

"The charger works well.  No overheating or other issues.  However, I have only charged at 200 mAh.  No rush.  No need to charge at a higher rate.

The two pairs of AA batteries that came with the unit have each lasted 19-21 days of pretty consistent usage in my Mac's Magic Mouse.  Alkalines last about a week longer than this.  Using a price of $.50 each for AA alkaline batteries (I know; there are lower prices.  There are also much higher.)  and my purchase price for the charger with four each AA and AAA batteries, the payback period is 3.5 years based solely on Mac Magic Mouse usage.

Note: A fresh charge of the Lacrosse AA's results in 1.44 - 1.46 volts though they are only rated at 1.2 volts.  Alkalines are generally rated at 1.5 volts.  Apple's Mouse Battery Level indicator under System Preferences is based on 1.5-volt batteries.  Therefore, fresh rechargeables do not show as a 100% charge in the Mac's Mouse Battery Level.

It was interesting to watch the mouse batteries' discharge rate as shown by the Mac System Preferences.  About 30% of the charge was lost during the first two days.  Days 3 - 17 saw a discharge of 22%--averaging -1.6%/ day.  The last 2-3 days saw a discharge of about 37% at which point they had to be replaced.

I ran one pair of the new Lacrosse AA's through the Refresh Process to compare to the other new pair run thru the Test Process (i.e., fully charge-discharge-fully charge again).  One battery took eight days to complete, the other took ten.  The improvement for the Refresh Process on these new batteries vs. Test Process was negligible, less than 100 mAh.  Refresh might be worthwhile on old, neglected batteries, however.

I have not used the AAA Lacrosse batteries that came with the unit.",5.0,0

"Potentially good earphones with two major issues. I can rate them 2.5 to 3 stars based on the units I received.
First of all, the construction quality is really good. Buttons, earbuds, cables, eartips - everything is made of very good quality. The aluminium case is another pleasant bonus.
Speaking of sound quality, it's good but not great. I felt the bass is weak even after tweaking equalizer on my laptop as well as phone. Audio (especially music) feels little flat as compared to other earphones I tested. Having said that, it doesn't mean it's bad and is surely acceptable for daily use. The volume controls operate individually (independent of source volume) so that's a very good feature. Range is very good. I didn't notice audio breaking while walking away from source unless I went too far. As compared to other earphones I've tested, these have larger bluetooth range.
Two major issues these earphones have are battery life and in-ear fit. In-ear fit is not quite good. It keeps falling off the ears even after trying all eartips and earfins. I found mid-sized eartips better fitting than others. It's certainly manageable when you are doing a desk top and not moving around much. They fell off once when I was walking around in office. Battery life is the biggest disappointment. The earphones get fully charged in less than 2 hours (as is the case with most of other earphones) but I got ""battery level medium"" audio prompt within first half hour of use. I used then for another 40 minutes and I got ""battery low"" prompt and within few minutes they switched off as battery was completely off. So I could use them for less than 1.5 hours after fully charging them. I'm not sure if the battery issue is by design or if the units I received have this defect.
Conclusion - These earphones surely have potential but aforementioned two major issues disappoint you. If they at least had good battery life, they surely deserve 4.5 stars.",3.0,0

UPDATE :  I must say, this company certainly cares about making things right.  I bought a pair of these headphones last year and the results were bad.  SoundPEATS contacted me and offered me a new pair at no cost, the only request they had was that I consider updating my review.  I have used them for a week and the new set works great.  The sound is great for the price.  The range is nothing like the first set and I didn't have problems losing connection this time.  They come with several different ear bud options and once I figured out which ones worked for me they stay in my ear just fine.  The wire that connects them does make noise when it bounces if you are running but using the clips that come in the box completely solve the problem.  I got a solid 4 hours use out of them, could be longer but thats the longest I used them at once.  The voice prompts for volume and incoming calls are nice.

It does fit snugly but I think it is really the Spandex.  If I could relax the Spandex a bit, I would really like this jacket.  I love the number of pockets, especially the fore arm pocket.  I use it for my ID card.  I love the hood with the visor.  I wear it to work over a tee shirt and polo shirt normally.  I would say it would be comfortable no lower than the high 40s F by itself.  You could extend that if you wore a fleece or sweater underneath.  It is more comfortable in the 50s F though.  I have worn it in some pretty good wind and rain storms.  Wind intrusion is not a problem.  So far, the rain has not penetrated the material either.  The slash pockets are a little high up for me though.

"I bought this game to use with children who have ADHD or other behavior problems. I got it on sale for about $10, so I really didn't expect much. (Why else would it be half-price, right?) But kids absolutely love it! Every child that used this game asked for it as soon as they came into my office. My own children love it, too. I used it with kids from roughly ages 3 - 9. They loved taking out the pizzas and getting them out of their pizza boxes. They also loved the silly toppings like a soccer ball or stinky sock. My 3-year-old likes playing the game, but he also likes pretending he is baking the pizzas in the oven (which is the game box). It lends itself well to adaptation and being creative with the instructions. It's durable, survived lots of kids.

"I purchased this bag in truffle which is a dark grayish color with a bright pink/coral inner liner color,  I wanted a convertible bag family vacations and the safety features made this the perfect bag for that.  Bag is roomy and will hold all the stuff I need to carry around when we are out and about on vacation.  The 2 side pockets and the top pocket all lock the front two pockets do not lock but they are great for non value things that you need to grab quickly.  The locking clips are a little hard to do at first but once you figure them out it's not a problem.
The main reason I selected a convertible bag is I wanted something that is a backpack for being hands free or it can be switched to a crossbody bag for going into a museum or a place that you can't have a backpack.
My only dislike about this bag is the handle strap across the top.  It looks really weird because it sticks out several inches making it look strange when it's on your back & it actually makes it a little unsafe when you have it on since it would be very easy for someone could grab it and pull you over with it.  I took a seam ripper and took it off (you can't cut it because the metal that runs through it to make it slash/cut proof) and I will just use the metal hoops for the strap when I use it as a crossbody bag.  Looks much better without the top strap.  Overall I'm very happy with this purchase and look forward to using it for many future trips and outings!",5.0,0

"This has become an essential tool to restraining my ever growing labrador. She is not out of control by any means, she just gets very excited about her walks and has a very powerful 4 wheel drive system that I cannot compete with.  She was also pulling hard enough that she was choking herself.  The choke collar would be counter productive in those terms, so decided to go with the pinch collar.  We tried a harness, but that only let her pull harder.  I was about to send her to Alaska to become a sled dog. Just kidding, we just need some time to work through it.

The first day I put this on she pushed the limits and yelped a couple times.  Since then, she has learned to respect the collar and we have not had any issues since.  She only goes to the end of the leash and lightly tugs at moments where she is really excited to meet another dog, while still respecting the collar.  Otherwise she has learned to leave some slack in the leash which is comfortable for both of us.  This product has made our walking experience infinitely more pleasurable.  I highly recommend.",5.0,0

There's extra room in the boot but I don't feel comfortable ordering down any smaller and want to leave space for socks.  These boots look/feel as if they would hold up in snow but I've yet to try.

"I've had nothing but trouble with this GPS since I replaced a Garmin unit that died shortly after it's 1 year birthday (conveniently just out of warranty).
The unit takes a long, long time to acquire a satellite signal; prior to trying to find a satellite it takes a long time to actually boot; the units touchscreen requires a hammer-like touch to register; the unit frequently takes us on unnecessary and inexplicable diversions - for example when travelling from A to B on a straight road with no discernible traffic, it will direct us to turn right for a mile, then left, left again, and back onto the straight road we were on in the first place (perhaps it is sponsored by an Oil company?)  One lesser gripe is the unit's inability to figure out that ""DR"" in an address means ""Drive"" and not ""Doctor"".  There are lots of annoying issues with this unit that make it marginally usable, and of course I waited way too long to ever address any of these issues with the manufacturer as I should have done - so much so that I just realized we're beyond the 1 year warranty again.  No more Garmin for us, ever.",1.0,0

"THIS IS A GOOD REVIEW (all negativity ends to be a positive ending), I give it 5 stars!

I had a MAJOR lightning storm that killed about 5 of my electronics, including my desktops network card, which is built into the motherboard. When I found out it wasn't working, I went searching on Amazon for a new one (since Amazons merchandise is always on sale, or just plain cheap, money wise) and found this. I kept a tab on this open and looked at other, but my decision came back to this because of how cheap it was, and the good reviews, AND a similar story to mine someone else said (lightning storm, built into modem, etc. ) When I purchased it, I completely forgot about it until it arrived today. I soon hooked it up, excited and all. As soon as I power it on, I got that Limited but No Connectivity. I went through EVERYTHING trying to fix it, over an hour and a half. Nothing. I went out and came back and still nothing. So I looked up online problems that could relate to this. After about 3 websites, I came across a forum comment saying to download a tool called WinsockXPFix, after opening this small app and 'Fix'ing it, it worked. And now I'm sooooo happy, enough to get back on here, and write a review. I also found that little app just replaces missing files old programs I uninstalled, took with them.

"I can only blame myself for not looking through the negative reviews on this bra. Everything that people said is true.
The bra is cheap looking from thin cotton fabric. Really not intended for sizes bigger than C cup. Also might be uncomfortably tight for sizes over 36.  I ordered XL (I'm 38D -38DD) and this is definitely way too small. It's also uncomfortable tight around my chest so no way I can wear it at night.
For the poor quality it's clearly overpriced as well. I feel fooled by trusting Medela brand to have some understanding of a breastfeeding woman's anatomy.
The return policy is not mentioned anywhere and I made another mistake trusting that it would be something similar to amazon's - i.e, free return on clothing that is in unused condition. Well, silly of me. There is a 20% re-stocking fee, plus you have to pay shipping costs. Together this will come for me to about 7-8$ at least, half of the bra's price. Not to mention that I'll have to find time to go to the post office to send it (not something you are looking forward to when you just had a baby). Otherwise why would you shop online if you can go to the store to find bra that fits?
While I understand the reasons behind the return policy on things bought from a third party through Amazon, I wish I was better informed about it before I spent money on this bra.",1.0,0

"Have had this camera since March, and I love it. I had a Digital Elph before this, so I was a little spoiled by how tiny they are and how easily they fit into a pocketbook, but this one can fit, too... just a little bulkier because of the ""hump"" for the batteries.

It takes clear pictures and video, has withstood my dropping it, and does a good job of focusing on faces.

Two negatives: first, the lag between photos can be unbearable, particularly when the flash has been discharged. I tried taking pictures in a theatre and had to wait literally about 30 seconds in between shots... which is terrible when you're trying to capture something as it's happening! When I loaned the camera to someone, she told me, ""I'd return it if I were you. I have no idea how you stand that.""

Thing is, I love just about everything else about it. If I had the money, I'd buy a different camera to use indoors and keep this one for the outdoors/good lighting shots.

The other negative is that it really isn't great with red eyes. My whole family is prone to red eyes, and haven't yet found a camera that reliably fixes that problem.

"These gloves fit really snug (Medium). I had tried some on at a local shop in Large, which I knew would be too big (baggy in the fingertips). I also took the advice of another rider who reminded me that most gloves stretch a bit over time. Despite being tough to get on and off, they didn't bind and were very comfortable when riding my recumbent or my upright.

I had hoped they'd be a little warmer, but overall I still like them.

Only real complaints:

--The velcro strap at the wrists is small and looks flimsy. I can see this breaking in the future. On the upside, they are so snug and have a little bit of a ""cuff"" so even if the strap breaks the gloves would be perfectly functional (the strap is almost superfluous).

--I would have expected a longer cuff towards the wrists for a winter-intended glove, and one they advertise as water resistant. Getting a jacket over the cuff really won't work very well: isn't long enough and no real edge to keep the jacket cuff from riding up your arm. Thankfully, I have dedicated rain gloves for wet riding.

UPDATE 3/21/17: downgraded from 4 stars to 3
The outside of the index finger on the gloves is wearing through, especially the right glove. I assume this is because of shifting or perhaps some other abrasion? It may seem harsh to downgrade from 4 to 3 stars after a little over 3 years of daily use for 6 months a year, but there was a time when even inexpensive cycling gloves would last many more years than this, so it's a bit of a disappointment.

I will likely not buy again, might see what Giro has to offer (since I like their Zero gloves for the summer).",3.0,0

"For Christmas my 11mo old recieved this wheelie bug (in small) and a red Y-Bike.

Preferences can be totally random with these little dudes, but my guy (he's been walking since 8 months, for what it's worth) hardly touches the wheelie bug.

When I do sit him on it, he'll happily accept a push around on it, and then get off.

The Y-bike on the other hand, he gets on by himself and proudly scoots around the house. It's totally adorbs. Y-bike for the win.

Although, since he's my 3rd baby, I can confidently say that, just because he ignores this cute little cow now, doesn't mean it won't be his favorite toy in three months and his Y-bike will be abandoned.

"I love sandals, especially since I live in the Phoenix area where it is sandal weather nearly year-round.  I have many, many brands of sandals from cheapie flip-flops to expensive dressy low-heel sandals, to go with all manner of clothing, casual to classy. However, I think I have found my perfect sandal with these!  Comfort, style and support - all-in-one.  I have a casual colored pair now, but can easily state that other colors will meet the nearly classy mode for slack outfits.  I have a high in-step and these sandals support every millimeter of my soles. The adjustable straps would allow for wider feet, although with my narrow feet, I could easily want a bit more tighter fit; however, foot movement is minimal due to  tri-band construction of these beautiful sandals. My new goal is to begin the process of getting these sandals in all the colors that fit my clothing/color style...which may be all of them!!!!

PROs:
Little to no break-in time required!!! Honest!
Great fit with adjustable straps...all three straps!
Excellent supporting foot-bed.
Quality materials.  Love the leather smell!
Flexibility. Sandal can flex in perfect harmony with natural body movement.
Sole - perfect on all surfaces!
Decorative medallions and bead - adds a touch of fun!
Fit - true to size...I wear a 6.5 - 7.0 and a 7 was just slightly bigger as I would expect in a quality shoe that comes only in whole sizes.
Love the mixed colored selections and the metallic leather choices!

"This is absolutely a brilliant,entertaining and challenging game,The price is reasonable and will stand up to years of use, either in a home or school-type environment
.However,care must be taken around small children who want to place things in their mouth,as several pieces are small enough to be swallowed. Also you have to be careful not to lose any of the pieces because any loss would render the game worthless. The quality of the game is excellent and the booklet of rules, puzzles and solutions is also excellent The booklet has a coil binding,so it can lie flat,the paper is very high quality as is the colored printing and it will withstand a lot of use. However the solution symbols are very tiny ,requiring lots of light and good eyesight or glasses.
 There are 60 puzzles ,grouped in 5 degrees of difficulty,Starter,Junior,Expert,,Master and Wizard.,each having 12 puzzles. The game resembles Rush Hour..but on Steroids. I would rate the difficulty level as 2,4,6,8 and  10 as the puzzles go from Starter to Wizard. For example the most difficult Starter puzzle,# 12 requires 26 moves to solve,the Expert puzzle # 36 requires 32 moves and the Wizard puzzle # 60 requires 123 moves to solve.
 So,there you go ,suitsable for all ages and puzzle solving skills.
Even younger ones will have fun playing with the game ,by ignoring the given puzzles and simply spilling out the pieces and trying to place them all in the tray,.
 I give this game 5* even though the packaging is not very good. First the package is about 3 or 4 times larger than it needs to be,the ""window"" should have had a heavy cellopane cover ( you can make one),and it should come with a cloth bag for storage or travel ( something else you can make.) It's a good idea to keep those nice bags that come with wine ,cosmetic ,etc.,bottles for this..",5.0,0
"I've been using Corsair products for the last 10 years or so, and I've never had one of their products let me down. I've got previous experience with their memory sticks, power supplies, mice, and static pressure fans. None of these products of their that I've used have ever had any issues or have ever stopped working prematurely.

With that in mind, these ML120 RGB PWM fans have been working great for me too. I've installed all three fans, along with the Lighting Node module in a Cooler Master Storm Trooper case set up for front to rear airflow. The fans are PWM speed controlled through the header pins on my Asus motherboard with a custom fan speed curve programmed in specific to the individual properties of each fan and mounting location.

These fans are providing plenty of airflow in the case and only ramp up to higher speeds that become somewhat audible, under more stressful computer loads. The majority of the time they run at reduced RPM's that are virtually inaudible compared to the rest of the ambient room noise. Never once has their airflow become inadequate, not even in an 85F ambient temperature room.

The iCUE software that controls that lighting features of these RGB fans allows them to be set up for a myriad of different color combinations, including dynamically changing colors based on what software is being run or games being played. The software has a small learning curve in order to get the most out of the features, and feature packed it is.

Overall these are excellent fans with more than adequate airflow for my needs, and they add a lot of visual pizazz too. Visitors always stop and comment on the colorful light show these case fans provide.",5.0,0

"The Click N Play Doll Scooter and Helmet set comes in 5 pieces. The handlebars snap into the base which already has the back wheels on it. The front wheel is a quick snap in the front and your scooter is ready for a doll. It also has a helmet and googles.

The goggles are awesome and so cute.  They look like the ones my daughter uses.

This set can be used with any 18 inch size dolls.

This will be a Christmas gift for my daughter so I hope to take another photo when it is all together but it comes separated in white box with no picture or markings other than to say it is a scooter. Perfect for wrapping.

My daughter is going to love that it has a helmet and Goggles. She was just talking about a pair for her dolls.

Well made thick plastic

"My last camcorder was sharp mini camcorder and I hate to buy tapes.  This camcorder sounds like a perfect fit.  I was pretty impressed with the quality of this when I saw someone took some video with this camera, and it was downsized too.  For $299 at amazon, I thought why not jump into the deal and I brought a 8gb sdhc card also.

I first took some video indoors at the highest settings and I noticed some noise when I took it, even with the flourscent light on.  Okay, I know about other reviewers who has problems taking videos in low light.  I took some pictures at the highest settings with the flash on and the pictures has alot of noise also.  Even most cameras with a flash can take decent pictures.

Took the camera outside on a bright sunny day with the highest settings and the videos didn't come out what I expected.  It was kind of noise when I took it and it wasn't as good as one of the reviewers showed.  The video quality was almost the same as my old minidv camcorder.  However, I looked at the pictures and it came out fine.  Then again, most other 7.1 digital camera should have no trouble taking pictures outside in a sunny day also.

I guess that I can't complain too much since I paid $300 for this camcorder but maybe if the quality is as good as advertised (even outdoors) I would give it 4 stars or more.",3.0,0

"I've been waiting for these boots all my life.  I have had severe lower back problems for a couple of decades.  I can do pretty much everything, including walking, without too much discomfort, but standing for any period more than a couple of minutes is incredibly painful.  Last weekend I spent 6 hours on my feet in these boots while canning and I never got sore at all.  Without sounding hyperbolic, these boots are kind of life-changing for me.  No other ""comfort"" shoe or boot has ever made one bit of difference in how I can function; these boots allow me to do everything I never wanted to do before: shop; socialize on my feet; work, etc.
As for the fit, I sized down as I have with my other FitFlops and there's still a little bit of extra room.  I don't mind this because I live in a place where thick socks make sense.  They fit well with a pair of thick socks, or two pairs of regular weight socks.
As for how they look, when I first put them on I thought they looked a bit like moon boots or Earth Shoes.  I was ambivalent about wearing them for the first couple of days and just kept trying them on in front of the mirror until I got used to them.  Now I LOVE the way they look and have gotten many compliments on how cute and stylish they are.  The look is a bit of a departure for me, as I'm used to wearing a bigger, more masculine boot, like a biker boot or a Doc Marten.  But these are adorable.  I love the extra height they give me.

My 2 year old niece (soon to be 3) got a kick out of this game.  We don't really play by the rules (maybe when she's 4?) - we just pull the cards and have her do the wacky steps; walk around the stick thingy backwards while holding the ""fishbowl"" on your head, etc.

I should back up a minute.  This game involves you (or your kid) drawing cards that tell you to do something, and you get points for doing it.  There are some ""props"" you have that you can put together - a fishbowl, a cake, etc.  The cards give you instructions like take 3 giant steps or hop 4 times or walk around the stick (that's the big yellow thing you see here) all while holding one of items on your head, on your belly, etc.  My niece is a funny kid, and she liked doing the steps.  She didn't care about the points or whatever, which is good because I didn't understand the game completely anyhow.  But that might be the point.  It IS Cat in the Hat, after all.

"After the problems with the rights for the 1966 Batman TV show were fixed, they finally released an action figure series.  I have been waiting for a figure of this Batman for decades.  Now I finally have one in my hands, and I'm unmistakably pleased (but not in a filthy way, just pleased).

Before everything, as usual, ignore the first production picture and just go straight for the pictures of the figure in the box, or the customer images if you want to know what the figure really looks like.  I'll give you a hint: it looks amazing.  The detail is wonderful.  Not only they perfectly captured the look of the series, but the figure has very good articulation too.  And while it's almost invisible in the pictures, the utility belt has the classic bat emblem too.

Like all the other ones in the series, it comes with a stand and a collectible card, with some artwork of Batman on the front and part of a Batcave wide image in the back, which is completed with the other cards.  The figure is perfectly able to stand on its own, since the feet are large enough and the cape is thankfully made out of light fabric rather than heavy plastic.

Like the other figures, this one has no accesories.  Which is kind of a shame, since Batman had a lot of crazy gadgets in the old series.  I'd have gladly paid double if the figure had come with a small can of Shark-Repelent spray.  No matter.  The figure on its own is a great accomplishment and it's very well crafted, so it's worth 5 stars.",5.0,0

"These shoes are so comfortable you will not want to take them off.  Even my sensitive feet with bunions are very happy in them.  True, they are not very elegant, since they look somewhat bulky, but at this point I prefer comfort over style.  The inner sole is soft suede with some cushioning underneath. I don't think the insole is real suede, rather it is microfiber and the upper lining is definitely synthetic fabric.

I bought black size 9.5 M and they are both slightly longer (26.7 cm=10.5 in) and seem wider than most medium widths since the fabric mesh allows more width flexibility above the sole.  They are not suitable for persons with very low or very high insteps as the zipper on top does not provide any width regulation (unless you leave the zipper partially open). The upper opening does not fit snugly on my low instep foot.  However the back sling has some elastic under the buckle, so the length is flexible and can be additionally adjusted by pin holes - I had to use the first pin hole. So, I would label them at least 9.5 W. I lowered the rating for incorrect sizing to fours stars.

The insole has perforations under the ball of the foot, which means the moisture gets under the lining and ... the odor stays longer. I used them in tropical weather (on a cruise, both on the ship and on the land) for less than a month and they already stink, though I do not have any sweating problem.

I also got surprised that my French shellac pedicure got stained, not only on the white strips, but on the clear body of the nails as well. My black microfiber suede tote bag also stained my French manicure, so this is the fault of the fabric stain (and shellac polish vulnerability). Maybe the light colored sandals don't stain though.

"Came in the mail really fast! 2 days time. Very good quality made ring. The brushed tungsten is darker than what the product photo shows, but still an attractive ring. My fiance' bought this as my wedding ring since we are on a budget, but again, it's very quality material & I'm very content with this purchase 

My ring finger was fitted as a 14 at some Jewelry Stores. I even had the chance to handle all the ring size rings myself to check it out, to find that perfect fit. 14 seemed to do the job. This ring does fit a tad bigger than what I was fitted for, so I would suggest you go down .5 of a size to ensure perfect fit. It's summer time here in Ohio & our fingers swell up in warmer weather, so the ring is secure enough not to fall off for now. But as soon as fall & winter arrive, I know I will have to purchase a 13.5 in a couple months so I can wear a ring in colder weather. But that's okay however, since the ring only cost the low price of $24, it won't even be an issue!

I hope my review helps someone in their decision making? There were other reviews specifically talking about the size offness, & with my confirmation, they were correct. Just buy one a half size smaller to match true fit!

God bless you all & may peace be upon you! I humbly ask for your prayers as I'm entering into Holy Matrimony here in 3 more days for a peaceful marriage, life longevity & happiness 

P.S.

The reason I gave it only 4 Stars was due to the fact the brushed Tungsten is darker than the picture shows & the half size differ that I & many others are talking about",4.0,0
"This is an attractive crate.  It was easy to open and put together with just a positioning of rods and sliding of cover.  Huckleberry tried it out and discovered that the zippers are ""self-healing"" zippers which means that they can be pulled apart and then restored by sliding the tab and slider back over the separated parts of the zipper.  That is how Huckleberry ""opened"" the front door of the crate and met me in the living room when I returned home.  He did not damage the crate but it was disappointing.  Huckleberry is comfortable in his usual crate, a metal one, and goes in readily when I tell him I have to go to work so I was surprised that he tried, successfully, to escape from this crate.  We will have to work on training him to this crate to try to avoid such escapes when we are traveling.",4.0,0
"So many reviews that seem to be written by folks expecting a ""magic wand"".  I have three small dogs, the newest of which is a 3 month old puppy. He was a ""biter"": people, things, himself, toys, furniture legs.....  However, the biting of me and the other dogs, seemed to be out of fear.
The other things can be attributed to teething.
The collar had a calming effect on this little rascal in about 2 days. I actually put collars on the other two dogs (bought the reasonably priced 3-pack from Sentry), as they were stressed by the change in our little family. All three have had a positive calming experience from these collars. Again, these are not magic, but the pheromone collar ALONG WITH soothing and training, have worked wonderfully.
I also bought the Sentry pheromone spray and have a witness as to the difference we realized when cleaning the first ear on the puppy - without spraying the area, and cleaning the 2nd ear, after spraying the air we were working in. She said to me, ""It's magic in a bottle""!  What a huge difference! I will continue to use the collars and spray until we are through the ""puppy months""!",4.0,0

"I ordered the black in white. The quality is good but it's not really the same as the other pair.  The front part is a bit narrow and the back is very large.  The material is not really stiff like a lot of other brands and is still very soft.  I don't think I will order it again.  I ordered a size up so I could wear it on my sister's wedding dress.  The material is soft and a good quality.  The material is very light and breathable so I would buy again.  The color is just a little darker than the picture but still good.  The material is thin and stiff which makes it a little difficult to wear.  I would recommend ordering it again.  I will keep it for my sister's wedding dress and hopefully she will wear it as well.

"The radio offers pretty solid features. I just had it installed and  pretty happy for the most part. The Bluetooth is excellent, I've had to play with the EQ because it won't sound right out the box, but once you adjust the audio settings, it's a beast. I also turned up the Bluetooth audio level and now Google Music sounds pretty awesome. I like how I an have music and Google Maps running and it lowers the music for directions.

USB - The USB gave me an ""Error 19"" but noticed my Nexus 5 goes into charging mode when I plug it into the stereo. All you have to do is drop the notification bar and change it from ""Charging"" to ""MTP"". I don't carry music so I have no need for it. I actually  wanted the USB for charging, but that's very disappointing. It charges at 80mAh - 110mAh which is poor and means my phone loses battery while plugged in and using Bluetooth. I drove for 15 mins and my battery went down like 8%. Most of my charges never drop below 500mAh, most give me over 1000mAh.

Aux - My Sirius Starmate 2 is using the auxiliary input. It sounds fantastic! I have ditched the FM transmitter and Howard Stern and the music channels come in very clear. I don't know why I waited so long to upgrade my stock radio.

This stereo is connected to my factory Rockford Fosgate and it sounds better than my Nissan RF dash unit. All in all, this radio, parts and install cost me a solid $210 or so. A bit more than I was expecting but worth the price.

Rating - I gave it a 4 only because the sufficient lack of USB charge. It's pretty useless for charging for me.",4.0,0

"First off, I have to say I made a mistake buying this, not carefully checking the size; it's too small for me. Not so much so that I can't use it, so I'll keep it, but I would have passed on it had I realized how much smaller than my prior bag this is.

On the positive side, this is made of a sturdy canvas that I expect will hold up well. It has plenty of pockets: an external velcro-sealed pocket on either end (a bit small for my glasses case); a large internal compartment; and, within that, a zippered internal pocket. There are three pockets outside the main compartment under the flap, two sealable with velcro. These can be used for small items such as a cell-phone or calculator.

On the downside, the main compartment lacks any zipper or other fastener, so items can come tumbling out. The side pockets are a bit small, and one of the three pockets under the flap also lacks a closure.  Also, the strap is not long enough for my needs. I'm fairly tall and I like the bag to come down to my hip. This bag rides too high and feels a bit odd when I wear it. These are minor complaints, however, so I only deducted one star.

Overall, I would recommend this bag to anyone looking for a good sling bag for everyday, light use.",4.0,0

It is sturdy, easy to put together, easy to use, does the job perfectly and  has saved so much time for the family (instead of standing there spraying tons of water everywhere). My 5 fur-babies (4 small and 1 ""large"" , but lets not tell her that), make a mess in my front yard and since I am the one who cuts the grass and uses all the tools for yard maintenance, this has been a savior. Now to get down to brass tacks; the customer service is beyond wonderful. The company sent an e-mail inquiring if I received the product and informed me of a How-To Video. The video was great and made using the product super easy. Stacy, the founder of Tidy Turd, is such a pleasure to talk to (
or write to really). I inquired about additional bags because my ""large"" pup makes a 'large"" mess. She was responsive in a very fast time, super friendly and understanding. She informed me that bags would be available for purchase coming up soon and to join the VIP club for special offers (which I did as soon as I received the first e-mail) and that she would be sending me some baggies to hold me over until available for purchase. I have no affiliation to this company or anyone who works/worked/etc with this company, however, I do believe that when there is a product that is a great price, works how it is suppose to AND has AMAZING customer service, a detailed review is warranted.

"I recently ruined the camera I was using--a Canon Powershot A3100 IS. I loved that camera and was sad when it was accidentally dropped and ruined. I was looking for a replacement and did quite a bit of research before settling on this model (Canon Powershot ELPH 110 HS). Most of the reviews for this model were very positive. I ran an online comparison between it and several other models and brands. I wanted a point & shoot because it's easier for me to use. (I have a form of rheumatoid arthritis) This camera is smaller than anything I've owned before, but I absolutely love it. One of the features that has impressed me and caught my eye on other reviews is the wide angle lens it possesses. This allows more light into each shot and the pictures I've taken so far have been impressive. They are crisp, clear, and the colors are extremely vivid. It's very similar to the Canon 3100 I owned, so figuring out how to use it has been a breeze.

If you are looking for a great point & shoot that takes clear shots with relative ease, this is the camera for you. I'm excited to try out the video feature--I haven't had a chance to use it yet, but with the grandkids coming this weekend, I'll be sure to give it a good workout.",5.0,0

"Funny, I just sold a Bulova Precisionist chronograph (9B175) this past week, and then ended up getting this one!  The other Bulova was a bit too large, heavy, and chunky for my tastes.  This one, however, is very nicely done!!

I have a large watch collection, including many dive watches - some at price points between $1K-2K.  Still, I am very impressed with what Bulova has done with this 300m Sea King!  The dial is simple, extremely legible, and beautiful.  The orange highlights look great against the black dial.  And the smooth sweeping second hand is a cool sight to behold.  It is smoother than the second hand on virtually any automatic watch.  The top of the bezel is brushed, and looks REALLY nice.  It has a usable lume pip at the 12:00 position, and the dial lume is pretty good also.  The rest of the case has brushed and polished bits, making for a very nice overall look.  The case is relatively large, at about 49mm diameter (not including crown).  Even the rubber strap is pretty nice for a $200 watch!  The case back even has a cool little logo on it.

The accuracy of these Bulova 262kHz watches is superb!!  You will only find equal or better accuracy in watches that are radio or satellite controlled - and many of those are much more expensive than this one.

All in all, this is a fine watch for $200+ dollars!!  I'm happy to add it to my collection.",5.0,0

It's labeled as appropriate for ages 3 and up and great not only for storage but easy travel.  Like most toys it's made of rather cheap plastic so the only question is whether or not it's durable.

"I was looking for a nice casual dress that I could wear for the spring and summer and luckily the opportunity came along to try this one. I likes it so much that I immediately ordered another in red and I might even get another color.
The dress fits me perfectly. I ordered mine in 3X. When I buy dresses similar to this style from Lane Bryant. I normally get the 18/20 size. The size chart of this dress list the 3X as suitable for 22W/24W. I guessed that the dress might run small... and in my case. I guessed right.
I wanted some brighter colors and the teal is really pretty and the red is a very bright and vibrant.
I like how light weight it is. It's very thin and that will keep me nice and cool especially in the summer heat. It's machine washable so I don't have to worry about a dry cleaning bill.
You can add a scarf or nice jacket to jazz it up for the fall you could even add leggings and/or a long sleeved shirt underneath for wearing it in cooler weather.
The only drawback is that the V-Neck plunges a bit too much, so I'll have to always wear a tank top underneath to keep my bra from showing.
It's not too long either. It falls right above the top of my feet, so I can wear it with sandals or heels. I'm extremely happy with this garment and highly recommend it.

"While no cat litter is fantastic at least this is organic and does not contain Silica. Clay litter may seem safe however our perfectly healthy 14 year old cat developed a lung condition, like silicosis, which caused from silica in CLAY LITTER. See http://petmac.org/arl/whats-the-big-deal-about-cat-litter/ for more information.  Even the ""dust free"" clay has dust...so 99% dust free compared to what?  We have been using the Blue Buffalo cat litter and like it. Yes it has some dust but it is NOT silica AND while it may have a bit of a strong smell when you first put it out, by the second day it is gone.  It clumps well, maybe not quite as well as clay but again it is not cancer causing. CDC, OSHA etc ALL have warnings about silica which is in Clay Cat Litter. Personally these manufactures not only do not care about our environment, they do not care about pets because if they did they would not put this poison on the market to hurt animals. Not only did we lose our recent little cat to this but 2 years ago we lost another one to lung cancer. We started doing research and this made perfect sense. Oh, both were big diggers and scratchers in the cat litter thus creating more of the dangerous dust. Please just stay away from ALL clay litters.",4.0,0

"I usually wear a 7 or 7 1/2 in most sandals, but I ordered an 8 due to reading the reviews.  I am so glad that I did.  They fit just fine. After one day, I got an abrasion to the top of my foot from the sandals.  I am not sure if it was because of the amount of walking I did, or were they shoes too closely fitted?  I have only worn them once, and I walked for quite a bit on the first day.  They were very comfortable and the nice lining helps your feet to not sweat.  So far so good, with exception of a small cut on top of each of my feet.  Hopefully it is just having to break the shoes in one day.

August 2014...Months later... these must be the worst Born sandals purchase ever.  Every pair I have purchased have been worn and worn.  However, the top strap of the shoe digs into the top of your foot.  I even had my daughter try them since she has smaller feet than me, and the top rubs slightly against the top of your feet when walking.

If you do not do a lot of walking, these shoes may be for you.  However, the top strap will rub gently, at first, into the top of your foot.  After a few hours, that gently part will start to form redness on your feet.  I never had Born shoes that did that to my feet before.  Maybe I just got a bad pair because it is mostly just the left shoe.",4.0,0

"My son received both the Stomp Launcher and Stomp Rocket Jr Glow as gifts and he loves both of them. The Stomp Launcher is nice because it doesn't go as high or far so it is a good alternative to outdoor play when it is raining out as it has been here lately. The Stomp Rocket Jr Glow is the one he prefers though because it does go higher and as it has been raining for so long here I closed off the entertainment center and let him play with both in the room with a vaulted ceiling. They are both great, but for different reasons. The Stomp Launcher is a little sturdier, but the step pad is smaller and the cord is shorter so with not as much air the rockets don't go as far but he loves that the rockets look more like a space shuttle style rocket. I suppose if I were to suggest one over the other I would recommend the Stomp Rocket Jr Glow unless you planned to use it inside at all then I would recommend the Stomp Launcher.",4.0,0

They do have a rugged sole that is good for walking in all kinds of weather. I have not worn them yet, but I have to say, I cannot personally see how the quilted fabric would be warmer than the material the shoe part is made of.

"The new board (the one with the round boulders for spaces, vs. old board with squarish spaces) makes it just about impossible to exit the ""endless loop."" They have changed the placement of the ""5"" and ""3"" spaces within the loop--previously, landing on one of these spaces would (unless you got a minus 3) guarantee your exit (in addition to landing exactly on the exit space), meaning you have a significant chance of being able to exit the loop on any given turn. Now, however, the ""5"" and ""3"" spaces will never land you on the exit--so they are pointless! There's almost no chance of landing exactly on the exit space on any given turn, which DRASTICALLY lengthens the game. The game has gone from fun to FRUSTRATING. And isn't the whole point of this to make math fun??

Our ""solution"" to this so far has been to just ignore the rule of landing exactly on the exit space, treating the exit space as any old space and ignoring the whole loop idea. This makes the game super short, but that's better for my 4 year old and she still gets addition/subtraction practice without the torture of drawing the game out for hours. I may end up taking a sharpie to the board and changing the placement of the 3 and 5 spaces to where they are SUPPOSED to be, to make it more playable.

If Learning Resources will either correct their game board or send me the older version of the board that actually makes sense, I will update my review with additional stars, as I think it's a great game otherwise. How did this major flaw make it all the way to production?

Carrots and celery are excellent for dogs, but corn is just a filler with no actual nutrients. I suppose because it it just that- a treat- that it doesn't really matter. The texture and consistency of this treat is about in the middle of a biscuit and a bone. Doesn't keep them busy very long like a rawhide, but it is more than just a one, two crunch of a typical dog biscuit like a milk bone.

Use 1 pack of Knox Gelatin and 2 cups of water and 2 rounded cups of Bird Seed. Prepare Gelatin per directions.  You can use 2 packs if you want the seed cake more firm.  They might even last longer, but I can't imagine the birds like it.  This makes 2 mini bundt ""Bird-Day Cakes"".

Mix together and pour/pack into mini bundt cake molds that have been sprayed with your favorite non-stick spray. (Gotta have the hole in the center for this feeder.) Place in refrigerator until set.

"I wanted stainless steel food dishes that sat lower than the standard locking food cups for my ferrets, for use in a Ferret Nation Cage.  By mounting the holder rings upside down, this causes the bowls to wedge into the ring tighter, and thus defeats all ferret efforts to spill the contents. They've never managed it even once, but it's still easy for me to remove the bowls for cleaning and refilling. (Because there isn't a tab on the bottom of these bowls they also sit flat on the counter!) I'm much happier with these proportions and this look. I also have two 16 oz versions in our (cat-sized) travel crate.

Additional Note- The cups that were sent by HorseLovers are Spot brand (by Ethical Products) and are actually all stainless-steel (no black coating on the ring and clamp, which has eventually rusted on other coop cups), and I like the look of this better. They have a thicker, sturdier ring with a looser fit than other coop cups I've bought, so I had to bend the rings a tiny bit toward oval so that the rim of the bowl jams tight against the metal prongs on the back of the clamp. Not a big deal at all, and worth it for stainless steel and a sturdier make. These bowls look like they'll last a long time.",5.0,0

"Keyword:  TUNITY
If you use the app Tunity on your phone to tune into and listen to TV channels on your phone via the Bluetooth speaker in a loud bar, then be ready to be disappointed.  I bought this specifically to listen to Bellator MMA (Spike TV/Paramount) while I was at my local bar.  The bar plays loud music and has tons of TV's.  So I had them put one TV on to the Bellator MMA fights and I used Tunity to play the audio over this BT speaker.  It wasn't loud enough though.  I had to hold the speaker right up to my ear just to hear the announcer on TV calling the fight plays.  So I'm going back to my 10W DIY bluetooth speaker and its heavy batteries instead.  Otherwise, I thought his BT speaker was nice.  It's tuned to play cleanly at full volume.  It just doesn't have ENOUGH volume.  Maybe if there was a button you could press to tune it for vocals only, then it could have played that louder.  Like a quick EQ button.  One EQ setting for music and one EQ setting for vocals only, that could play louder.",4.0,0

fit-comfortable, and comes with different sized extra inserts.
you definitely hear the tunes, very clearly, but bass is not there.

PART II
after using them for awhile, i've upgraded my opinion of them to ""great"".
very comfortable as compared to apples things, which are very uncomfortable and sound pathetic.
sound is really CLEAR and crisp, i like that alot.  there is bass, but not like a good pair of headphones, its not blasting at you like a rappers car stereo in the hood. but its there if you have a good ear.

bought another pair as backup, new puppy likes them too :)

"This is an excellent toy for my whale shark loving 4 year old. Reasons we love it:
- beautiful paint and coloring, very true to life
- no open areas in the plastic so it can go in the bath with no risk of mold
- very good size compared to other ocean animal toys, so it has the feeling of being whale like!

It is pretty heavy and the fins are hard plastic. I suppose it could hurt to step on, or hit a sibling with, but this is a great whale shark. If you're a marine enthusiast I could see it working as a display for adult collectors as well since it's life-like (not cartoony).",5.0,0

"When we got our new puppy, we were told ""she's a chewer"" and given some rawhide chews for her. Those did NOT work. Our vet suggested we try a Kong toy for her, because they're made to withstand even the most heavy chewers. When we first got it, our girl showed little interest...but I read online that someone got their dog ""into"" the Kong by filling it with peanut butter and freezing it. I did this, and our little girl spent HOURS trying to get all of the peanut butter out.

I would say that the Kong is a great chew toy, but not on it's own. None of my dogs find it interesting in the least unless it's filled with something.  That being said, if you're willing to put something yummy inside of it, then you have yourself a winner most likely.

The wallet is a bit smaller than I expected it to be, but the pockets are a little longer than I expected.  This wallet is a nice wallet for the price, and I like it so much that I have bought another one for my husband.  I'm very pleased with this wallet!

Overall, it's a nice wallet.  It's not too big, but it's not too small either.  It's a nice thin wallet for the price.  It's also a good quality.  It's not the best looking wallet, but I like it.  It's not really a bad wallet, but I'm not sure I would use it for anything other than driving.  It's a nice wallet.

"This little portable router worked perfectly, with the setup minimal.  Only thing missing was a case or pouch to carry it.

I went to Las Vegas recently with my Nexus 7 tablet, which does not have a wired ethernet port.  I also assumed that some of the hotels in Vegas still had wired internet connections in their rooms.  My stay was at the Monte Carlo, which only has the wired connection in the room.  So I plugged cable into this router in the Access Point mode, which in turn sends out wi-fi signals that my Nexus7 picked up.  A couple of tabs on the Nexus7 to accept the hotels terms, etc. and I had internet access.  I was able to check my emails, etc. in my room.  Since the hotel charges you a daily fee which includes Internet access, might as well put it to good use.

So this TP-Link router worked as advertised.  Plug in the required cables, setup was almost automatic, and instant wi-fi connection to the Internet.  The price was great too.",5.0,0
"I have high arches and because of this, initially found that the part of the shoe that goes over the top of my foot close to my ankle is so rigid that they were uncomfortable to wear for more than a little while at a time.

Additionally, they are great looking and seem to be very high quality--I am confident that they will last.  Also, I think the footbed is very comfortable and they seem to support my high arches just fine. I have both the patent black leather and the blue Cayman style. The blue Cayman is absolutely Exquisite and the color in the picture does not do the shoe Justice. It is a beautiful almost metallic silvery blue and I just love it.

"The Bose Solo 15 is a compact TV/computer sound system that improved the sound we get when watching TV. For us it fixes the previous problem of turning up the sound to hear whispered conversations on TV or videos and then having the music or sound effects blare deafeningly, throughout movies and TV we watch. It is black and one piece that is three inches high, 25 inches long and 14 inches wide. It is designed to have your flat screen TV, weighing up to 75 pounds, set on it, which is convenient.  It should be noted that this unit is similar to other `soundbar' types of speaker systems; therefore if you sit too far from your TV you may not fully experience left and right channel separation. Set up of this Bose is a snap with one optical connector or two RCA connectors, plus it needs to be plugged into an AC source. The remote which is included can be used for gaming systems and Blu-ray players.  This unit would be ideal for use with big monitor computer setups, especially for gaming since the bass quality is tunable by an easy to reach single knob on the back of the unit. If your TV is in a cabinet take the Bose dimensions into account before ordering it.",4.0,0

"This is one of the absolute best party games ever.  I bought A2A at a local game shop on a whim years ago.  My Amazon purchase was the big set for a friend and his family.  Be prepared for hours of fun.

Here is the general idea:

First, get a group of people wanting some social fun
Second, pass our the Noun cards (they aren't called that, but that's what they are)
Third, start with someone called the ""jusdge"" who picks up an adjective card (again, not what they are called, but it's what they are)
Fourth, the judge tosses the card into the center and other players pick a noun that embodies the card the judge tossed out.

The person who is the round's ""judge"" tosses out a card that is a descriptor.  Let's say that the word is ""Hot.""  Other players look through their collection of cards to find a word that embodies ""hot.""  One player might toss in ""Marylin Monrow"" and another might toss in ""The Sun.""  Which will the judge choose?  Maybe your comments might influece the outcome.  Go wild!

This is a game learned by new players in less than a minute.  If it's not on your game shelf, it should be.

Note: we play with a local rule that's similar to musical chairs: The judge rejects the last entry on the table.  This encourages fast play.  If all players play a card quickly, the judge has the option to accept all entries.",5.0,0

"REVIEW REFERENCES the ""Wireless"" Unit:

Pros:

1. Connectivity is rock-solid and it took about 5 minutes to set up a new secure network. Smart devices in the home easily jump between this network and the old one in different wings of the residence.
2. Linksys is a company I trust because my Linksys router has been working non-stop for 8 years without a single problem. I expect their networking equipment to just work and it does. Always.
3. This unit is so smart that you can switch which outlet it's plugged into by yanking it off the wall and plugging it in somewhere else. It will remember all of your settings and reboot itself in under a minute. This is great for experimenting time when you want to see which room/outlet gives you the best reception/range.

Cons:
1. Nothing major, but note that structural walls will degrade your signal slightly; and that's going to happen with pretty much any wifi product you buy.",5.0,0

When I started flying it, I found that the rotation rate is very fast, but low speed is painfully slow, and high speed would not keep up with a stock 107. Every heli I've flown has it's own characteristics. Some are quick, others sluggish, some fast, others are touchy. This one is just plain weird! A curved left, in high speed makes it almost stop and spiral up. A right curve, if done just a little to fast, causes it to do a motorcycle-type high-side, causing the upper and lower blades to collide, causing an instant crash!

Unboxing - Boxes are heavily taped up.  Lots of Styrofoam separates separately from satellites.  One thing I noticed was lots of wires,  the right speaker is the control unit, so you have red/black lead, a control wire that connects to speaker, and phono plug that goes to computer.  The left speaker only has red/black lead.  The subwoofer connections are spring loaded.  Some stick on padded circle feet are included.

Setup - With all the wires going around, you will need to remove the plastic wrapping and undo the twist ties.  Be careful with the connections especially the red/black not to reverse them and don't force the control cable into the sub, as it can go in only one way.

Sound - Klipsch is known for room filling sound.  Not terrible, not great.  However, listening at low- normal volumes I had some weird static/cracking sound on the left speaker.  I said ok, a fluke, so exchanged it for another in store.  The second unit was better on the left channel, but it had popping/cracking (like popcorn) sounds when the subwoofer was activated.  I can't pinpoint what the cause was in both situations - is it amp, crossover, something loose in the speakers, who knows.  My PC does not have a problem with other speakers so I know the problem is with Klipsch

I spent more time unpacking, setup, and packing, rather than listening to speakers.

I hope you others don't have the same problem.  After returning the second unit, I went on the floor to see what they had out, and guess what the Promedia 2.1 they had on the floor had some static noises on left speaker too!

As such, I cannot recommend these",1.0,0

"My dogs are family members and as such deserve good supplements.  One of my girls has been taking/eating PhyCox for a couple of years (she's now 13) and it has helped her mobility tremendously.  I also have a 4 yr old that I compete with in Obedience and want her to maintain her athletic ability as long as possible, so while she doesn't currently have any obvious physical problems, I use PhyCox as ""vitamins for her joints"" and she's doing very well.  One thing I love about PhyCox is that my dogs literally ignore their kibble and eat their PhyCox first everytime, so it not only does good, it tastes good too!",5.0,0
"my two cats LOVE these and i think the texture of the treat itself actually does ""brush"" their teeth some: each piece has a tight skin, like a sausage casing, so their teeth have to puncture the skin first, which i think is a great start and simulates natural tooth-cleaning textures they would find in nature. inside, the treat is dry and brittle, so as they chew, little flakes splinter apart perpendicular to the tooth surface, and i really imagine that this is as close to tooth-brushing as a treat can get. in addition to this effective texture, there are ingredients that are designed to reduce plaque enzymatically and (temporarily) increase oral pH to inhibit bacterial growth. the ingredients list for these treats is much shorter than other dental treats, and i think much more natural, safe, and healthy.

my cats get one treat each, once after breakfast and once after dinner. they both go nuts at treat time and one of them runs all the way to the other side of the apartment to eat his treat so that the other can't steal it. the only problem is that now i have to deal with them milling around the cabinet where i keep the treats.

i buy the poultry flavor because i don't like to give my cats a lot of fish, but these are a fish based treat regardless which flavor you buy, and they smell VERY fishy. i don't think there is much point in choosing a flavor, so if one is cheaper than the other or on sale then just buy the cheaper flavor.",5.0,0

"We received an older version of this item from friends whose daughter used it (and still wanted it at 3 years old). We turned it on for our 4 month old who can't sit up on her own just yet and she was immediately intrigued by it, constantly watching its movements. On the first try, she started indicating she wanted to reach out and touch it so we moved it close to her and she clutched at it immediately ..... and bent down to try to ""taste"" it (we'd already disinfected it but still didn't let her put her tongue on it). It's been 2 weeks and she still enjoys it and is grabbing on to it as much as she can. I'm sure she'll enjoy it for a long time so I'd recommend it to other parents of infants.",4.0,0

"I purchased 2 bras....this one and the Bali Women's Smooth U Front Close Bra.  I prefer T-back style bras because I absolutely hate when a bra strap falls down on your arms.  I am 135 pounds, 5'1"" and about a C cup.  I used the measurement advice found on the descriptions, and it showed me to be a 36C.  I am returning this bra for the following reasons:  1. The material is thin.  No padding, just a stretchy fabric.  I didn't realize this, so I guess I missed that in the description.  I might have kept it had it fit.  2. I had ""fall out"" all around the cup.  Not just a little, but a lot.  The straps were tight, and it goes up high on the collar bone, so there was literally breast poking out all the way up to the shoulders and collar bones area.  Have never had that experience before.  I loosened the straps to the lowest/longest position, and it only lightened the ""squish"" a little bit.  Still fall-out.  3. it was scratchy.  And to top it off, it was an expensive bra. THe other one I ordered (Bali) was only $16...and it fit like a dream.  Lots of support, comfortable, could sleep in it if i had to.  I know that Wacoal is a good bra maker, but I was looking for features that this particular bra did not deliver.  I don't know if a 38C or a 36D would have been the right choice with this bra, it definitely felt too small, but the 36C with the Bali was perfect.",2.0,0

"but just couldn't do it. For reference, I bought the size 11 in navy blue, the size 11 in red and the size 11 in black. The navy blue is a darker color and the black is a lighter color. I wore them for about an hour and still have no complaints. They are great for lounging around in the house and on the beach. They are very comfortable and look great. I bought these for my husband. He loved them and they fit great. He is 5'10"", about 165lbs. He is 5'4"", 140lbs. He has had them for a couple months and they have been great. He said they are comfortable, but I would have given them 5 stars if I had not worn them. Very comfortable, it is a little narrow, but I have a very small chest. I have a large chest and it is tight, but not too tight. This is my second pair of this cute leggings. They are very comfortable and fit well. They are soft and comfortable.

"I am a first time owner. I read that it is best to feed a puppy higher quality foods instead of the big commercial brands.  After reading a lot of positive reviews, I decided to try Wellness Super5 for Puppies. Worst mistake I ever made.  My little bully's stool was never firm.  It did however make his coat very shiny. But he developed a very bad case of diarrhea. He stopped eating and drinking for a day.  I was so worried about the lil guy. After an overnight stay (& a very expensive vet bill), my lil bully returned home full of energy.  The vet recommened that he would have to eat canned Purina EN for the rest of his life.  Realizing that they really just wanted my money, I decided to switch his food.  I decided to go with Canadae ALS. During the transition, BlackJack was still having a loose stool. After more research, I finally decided on Cal Natural Lamb & Rice. I started mixing this food and BJ developed a very bad bloody diarrhea case.  I started the ""at home remedy"" of pepto bismol and a bland diet.  The pet store clerk recommended some canned pumpkin as well.  BJ fasted for 24 hours.  After feeding him boiled chicken & rice for a few days, the blood gradually disappeared. I slowly started mixing the Cal Natural Lamb & Rice. All i can say is BJ is feeling 100% better and his stool is solid!!!  This was the result I wanted with Wellness, but I was very disappointed.

"I only rated this iPad case 4 stars because I did not have anything similar to compare it against. However, I will say that I can find no fault in its design or its ability to do the intended job. I can't imagine there is another unit that could perform significantly better. It appears to be well made, rugged, attractively designed, and easy to use. I recently changed from a cover which had a keyboard built into it. That unit worked fine, but I found myself more often than not, using the onscreen keyboard. This is a much simpler cover that looks and performs nicely. I like the ability that this cover gives you to adjust the angle of the screen.",4.0,0
"This jacket arrived weeks earlier than expected, a pleasant surprise.  It is thick, soft & warm just as described.  And it is lovely!  The size small (tag says med) I ordered fits my 4.6 lb. Chiweenie well except it is a little long on her back extending down over the base of her tail. This will not be a problem as I just tuck it under a little when she wears it outdoors and it stays tucked.  The extra length will be nice to keep her warmer when she wears this for other purposes.  I love the 3 snaps on the underside of the tummy as it makes this garment easy to put on & take off.  I also appreciate the ribbing around the sleeve openings & bottom hem as this should provide durability.  Just wish there was a leash opening at the base of the hood.  It looks darling on her & I recommend this snuggly highly.",5.0,0
"We have a Yorkie-Poodle mix and her coat is constantly getting matted. We do try to brush her fairly often, but in her daily mischief, she still manages to get tangled. Typically, this means we're cutting matts out, which is usually a traumatizing event for all. Previously, we have just washed her with just a dog shampoo. It didn't really occur to me that we should be using a conditioner as well, until I came across this product.

We have bathed her and used the Everyday Isle of Dogs Silky Coat shampoo and conditioner several times now, and there has been a noticeable difference in her coat. Not only is her hair silkier but it matts much less often. She also smells great afterwards! We also have two Pug mixes and have used this shampoo/conditioner on them, so don't think it's for silky coated dogs only. It's worked wonderfully on all three of our dogs, regardless of the hair type.

I would highly recommend this shampoo/conditioner for any dogs prone to matting or if you just want to give your dog a smoother coat and a great smell!",5.0,0
