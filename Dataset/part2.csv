"I went and saw this in theaters and then bought the DVD and i have to say it is a awesome movie full of action and suspenseful moments. Then lets not forget Paula Patton in a dress that will make the eyes on any guy widen while he utters the word WOW! I still nearly drool at that point in the movie. MI Ghost Protocol is by a long shot the best of the series so far. The mix of suspense, thrill, action and stunts will leave even your most demanding action junkie pleased. This is not a film that will leave much of a long standing mental impression on you, which means you won't walk out of it with a changed view on life. Then again not many action movies will change your view on life. It won't make you do much thinking like other fairly recent films like Inception but then if you use Inception as your baseline for what you like then you will find yourself displeased with movies quite often. Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol is still a awesome movie that has a good plot for a action movie, good action/stunts, and the action was really good. The plot is simple like many action movies but the on-screen things like action and dialog make up for it. Then the car  with a Heads Up Display is in one word is awesome...

4/5 Stars Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol is a great movie and i recommend it to anyone who likes action movies.",4.0,0

"While no cat litter is fantastic at least this is organic and does not contain Silica. Clay litter may seem safe however our perfectly healthy 14 year old cat developed a lung condition, like silicosis, which caused from silica in CLAY LITTER. See http://petmac.org/arl/whats-the-big-deal-about-cat-litter/ for more information.  Even the ""dust free"" clay has dust...so 99% dust free compared to what?  We have been using the Blue Buffalo cat litter and like it. Yes it has some dust but it is NOT silica AND while it may have a bit of a strong smell when you first put it out, by the second day it is gone.  It clumps well, maybe not quite as well as clay but again it is not cancer causing. CDC, OSHA etc ALL have warnings about silica which is in Clay Cat Litter. Personally these manufactures not only do not care about our environment, they do not care about pets because if they did they would not put this poison on the market to hurt animals. Not only did we lose our recent little cat to this but 2 years ago we lost another one to lung cancer. We started doing research and this made perfect sense. Oh, both were big diggers and scratchers in the cat litter thus creating more of the dangerous dust. Please just stay away from ALL clay litters.",4.0,0

"Set in the 1960's, this `Happy Days' spin-off series that debuted on ABC in the Spring of 1982 that pertained to Joanie Cunningham(Erin Moran) and her boyfriend Chachi Arcola(Scott Baio), who move to Chicago and start a rock band, often performing at his family's Italian restaurant, but had tanked after only 2 months, due to weak ratings since it was ranked at #17 as 25 Biggest TV's Blunder list since people argued that Joanie & Chachi wasn't what viewers wanted to see since it was the ""Fonz""(Henry Winkler)who reeled in the viewers to HAPPY DAYS, which resulted in JOANIE LOVES CHACHI's cancellation in the Summer of 1982 with Baio and Moran returning to HAPPY DAYS in its final season.

These sets work well and are an easy way to add a little safety to your home. The other two sets are a bit pricey. The basic design of the set is pretty straight forward and well made.

"3 stars is a little harsh - but I only gave the Royal Albert Hall one 4 stars and I liked it better than this, so I've got to go one less.  Why?  Like on RAH, the guests were a total distraction.  Unlike some reviewers here, I really do not care for Ms Hart's vocal stylings.  My negative reaction to her is nearly as strong as my deep disappointment with Glenn Hughes & the BCC sound.  Hiatt and Rodgers were like the guests on RAH - old greats that just don't hold a candle anymore to the stratospheric Mr Bonamassa.

Fortunately, it's a nice full program and so you can skip past the guests and still feel like you got your money's worth.  Joe and the boys are really very good - worthy of the many 5 star reviews here.  Bergman is the only lineup change from the group I saw perform live - and a fine addition.  I especially liked Blue and Evil, since that was the highlight for me on Black Rock.  I was delighted that Joe dug into the old catalogue and pulled out The River, because I missed him playing that one when I saw him.

But that tees up my recommendation.  RAH is better than this for the musical selections but the DVD you should really get is the old Rockpalast one.  Joe really shines in that more intimate club setting and you can see why he deserved the recognition that enabled him to move on and play the grande venues.",3.0,0

"I do love it.  It's light weight, feels well built, rolls easily over cracks and great for getting the boys out of the house and into some fresh air.  I know it's silly to take two cats for a walk in a stroller but have you ever walked a feline on a leash?

I received this last week and the first 3 times they balked a bit as I made the walk only 20 minutes long.  Gradually they got used to being in a confined area.  I kept it open and in the living areas so they could play in it but their play got to be a bit rough and I see they have a pull in the netting.  That was my fault and certainly not of the manufacturer.

Now I bring it out of the closet and they both get in.  The walk is up to 1/2 hour and today they even laid down and I didn't hear a peep.

You should question how big your critter is before putting him into this stroller since it is a tad small.  My cats aren't yet a year old and probably not even 5 lbs. each.  There's no problem with them walking inside.  However, I hope they don't get too big to use through the years.

I recommend and do like the no zip.  The only thing I don't like is that I can't store the stroller folded and standing upright.  Perhaps I'll need to get a luggage strap to wrap around.",5.0,0

"The Fulcrum 30030-308 wireless remote LED light is a simple and effective way to add light to a room or a closet that doesn't already have a light and a light switch. It's a battery-operated setup and remarkably easy to install with double-backed tape.

In fact, there is an on/off switch on the light itself so you don't even need to use the wireless remote to control the light if you're just adding the light to a small hallway closet or under a cabinet to light up a workbench. The built-in adjustable timer works great and automatically turns off the light after a pre-selected period of time (to save battery life) if you forget to turn off the light.

My only minor complaint is about the size of this set. I'm glad the light is ""tall"" from top to bottom and ""wide"" from side to side so that the light source is large enough to be both bright and soft instead of looking like a flashlight ... but the light fixture itself is pretty ""thick"" or ""fat"" from front to back and that makes it less than ideal if you're trying to hide this light under a cabinet or on the wall in a small closet. Similarly, the remote light switch is unusually large compared to how small other wireless on/off remotes are.

Bottom line, this works and I'm mostly happy with it, but I'd be even happier if the light fixture was ""flatter"" from front to back and the remote light switch was smaller.",4.0,0

"I bought this light 2 years ago to put in my son's room as a night light, and the matching blue star light. The yellow cover is not as opaque as the blue star light and puts out more light. Enough to brighten the room to see where you're going, and that's about it, which is just what we wanted. It screws into the wall and then has a long white cord with a toggle switch for on/off. We never turn ours off.

The light comes with a 25 watt bulb. After almost 2 years of leaving this light on 24/7, the bulb burnt out. I searched everywhere and could not find a bulb! Several reviewers had luck at Lowes, but I did not. After a lot of research and buying several bulbs that didn't fit, I found that the bulb has a European base, which is not easily bought in the US. The base size needed is E14, and standard candelabra bulbs are E12. So I searched on Amazon and found a converter that allows an E12 base bulb to fit in an E14 socket. I got a 6-pack of converters for less than $8 and bought a pack of E12 base candelabra 25-watt bulbs. And it worked perfectly! The light is a little bit brighter with the new bulb than it was before.

"We just got our first puppy about a month ago and did not realize how hard potty training would be. We live in an apartment and our puppy could not ""hold"" during his hourly trips to the elevator and outside, so we had to resort to an indoor potty. We first tried the scented pads- our pup would just play and shred them to pieces. We had a fake grass which worked well but it smelled really bad, clean up was a hassle and he was eating plastic bits. So when we came across DoggieLawn on Amazon, we decided to give it a try- at least he'll be eating real grass. It came on schedule in a prepackaged box, all you have to do is take off the lid, the grass was so green! Our puppy did his business on the grass immediately, but for the first few days there was a lot of grass eating and lounging on the pad.  You would need to supervise and make sure the dog is using it correctly. The best part is, there was no odor and no clean up! The urine gets absorbed in the grass pad and doesn't leak through the paper box. (we don't let him do #2 on the doggielawn). Also it's low maintenance- just spray with water a few times a week. We've had our doggielawn grass for a month now and it's time to change- it's turned brown and the odor is accumulating but it lasted longer than the 2 week period recommended by the company. Our pup has learned to go potty (#1) every time we put him on the grass. The downside is he was able to dig a small hole in the grass, however there's an option of getting an anti-dig mat which he haven't tried. Also, it is a bit expensive: $29 per one grass pad or a $50/month subscription for 2 pads. We'll keep getting these until he's fully potty trained!

We have a 10lb puppy and the standard size is perfect- there's enough room for him to circle and sniff.",4.0,0

"I always thought of Night Gallery as the second generation of Twilight Zone. This show is pretty similar to Twilight Zone in that it mixes the supernatural with Sci-Fi and suspense. Rod Serling had supposedly starting planning Night Gallery as early as 1964 when TZ was cancelled. Is Night Gallery as great as TZ? No, but it's a great ""second coming"" if you will. Night Gallery opens with Rod Serling describing each story with its own unique painting, which usually has to do with  something in the episode.

Season 1 is relatively short, containing only 6 50-minute episodes. The picture quality leaves a bit to be desired, as the picture is a bit scratched in some parts and colors seem a bit weak sometimes. The audio is relatively quiet so just turn your TV volume up nice and loud for this set. The Universal logo appears before each episode and it BLARES in comparison to the show's low volume.

The only sort of ""bonus features"" are some bonus stories. I'm not sure if these were unaired or just taken from other seasons, but they they're on disc 3 after the 6th and final episode of the season. Also included on Disc 1 is the original 1 and 1/2 hour Pilot film filmed in 1969.

Overall, the episodes appear complete though the quality isn't exactly as great as it could have been. Is the set worth 20-some dollars? I'd say not.

I purchased the MM 520 because it seemed like a reputable company one year ago.  I was so wrong.  from the day of purchase nothing but problems.  This things been out of commission over 8 months out of a year I had it.  Every time I call them they make you test everything.  It's a good thing I know how to use an electric meter and have one around. After going through loops every single time they want the board sent back to them.  On the phone they tell you they will get one sent back to me in 5 days but it always takes about a month. Their constant excuses is they are under staffed.....  last time I had issue was due to constant beeping.  They wanted me to send back the unit back to get me another master board. well they sent me one but it did not work.  Then they wanted me to send them the arm and the board which I did.  Called them after three weeks of waiting and they tell me there is no board that came with the arm.  WHAT??????  So finally got it back after two months and it had a slave board instead of the master board.  that's not all. I get a package from them about a month ago with someone else control board and battery.  I have never dealt with such unknowledgeable support and disorganized company in my life.  What a joke.  DO NOT buy this product or any other product from this company.  Unless you enjoy paying over a grand for the product and accessories so you can open the gate by hand 70% of the time.

"Not since ""Plata Quemada"" has Argentina made such an amazing movie.  Soul-wrenching storytelling and amazing cinematography make this a must-see for anyone.  There's a camera angle in this movie, though perhaps helped by computer, begins high over a soccer (football) stadium, pans down over the field, beyond the goal, into the screaming crowd before focusing on one face, then follows the ""owner of the face"" down into the bowels of the stadium itself...SEAMLESSLY.  Not that the amazing camera work is the best thing about it, but I remember the first time I saw the movie thinking about that as it was happening.  Anyway, back to the story...it's epic.  Told somewhat in flashback, it covers over 30 years in the life of a government employee whose life was altered dramatically over choices made in his youth.  I can't tell you anymore of the plot, but I can tell you that you should definitely SEE THIS MOVIE!!  It's well worth it.",5.0,0

"This was an impulse lightning deal buy. I own a few ceramic blade knives. A couple of folders and a chefs knife. Those are decent tools. Sharp enough to shave hair. This box cutter wouldn't be so bad if it had any kind of edge on it. I'm not talking shaving here I just mean an EDGE! I have sharper butter knives. It still cuts through packing tape but going through cardboard ain't so easy. This thing has an auto retracting blade. It requires constant tension with your thumb to hold the blade out while trying to hold onto the cutter. This in combination with the dull blade makes cutting though tougher materials harder than it needs to be. If they had just sharpened it a little bit more it would work so much better. The magnet is a nice touch and makes it more accessible. Still, I'll stick with my metal blade box cutter and just be careful. Another thing to keep in mind, ceramic blades are harder than metal blades but that means they are more brittle too. Put too much sideways pressure on this blade and it will break like a clay pot .It can't be returned! No Dilly! UPDATE: I was too harsh with my review of this little dude. After using it more I've change my mind about one thing. It does exactly what it is designed to do. Open packages and boxes. All of my earlier criticisms were warranted. It sucks at cutting up cardboard. The retractable blade while being a valid saftey feature is still a pain. Maybe it will wear in after more use. The cerramic blade could be sharper but it suffices for cutting packing tape and soft packaging. But I am also glad it was unreturnable. This forced me to use it more and see it's value. It gets another star for effectiveness. I'm still glad I didn't pay full price for it.",4.0,0

"I ultimately ended up sending these back.  Here's why...

In my last home, I outfitted everything with GE Reveal bulbs.  It's the best light there is in my opinion and I wanted a similar look in my new home but wanted to make the switch over to LED everywhere.  I figured daylight would be the best solution so I bought these.  Wrong.  It's on the higher spectrum of daylight and really makes everything look pale/grey-bluish. I didn't care for the color at all and only realized after some research that there's more to the color temp that makes the Reveal bulb so good.  Anyway, I changed it out for a warm white which although slightly yellow is more pleasing than the harsh color of these.  I just wish someone would sell a 4200k bulb which would be ideal.

In comparison to a standard halogen, the heat difference is noticeable.  These are nowhere near as hot and should save me in the end in regards to power bills.  Although the spread is listed at 45 degrees, I feel halogen bulbs were a little wider just from the nature of the bulb.  These seem very focused at 45 degrees so the kitchen doesn't seem quite as bright as with the halogens.  Overall, I pleased enough to stick with the LED change.",3.0,0

"My plecostomus devour these (API) algae wafers in no time flat. They apparently love the taste. I feed them these daily and occasionally give them some fresh zucchini. I like that the wafers settle on the bottom of the tank quickly and dissolve easily. However, they do cloud the water a bit, but that is to be expected especially if you have any light, natural or artificial, since light grows algae. My tank sits near a window, so it does get some natural sun, so a little algae is inevitable and doesnt really bother me. I just embrace the fact that sometimes the water doesnt look clean. And finally, these wafers aren't terribly expensive, they will run you a little over $6 for a 3.7 oz container. Because of the size of mine (about 1 foot and a half each), I go thru about a container in a little over a month. Regardless, these algae wafers seem to make them happy.

She did not have an infection.  We discovered it was not all that uncommon for female dogs to develp some urinary tract and bladder weaknesses after they are spayed.

We noticed a change in her in about three weeks.  She stopped having accidents and leaks.  She loves to chew the tablets.  They are liver flavored so she thinks they are a treat. When she ran out of them for a few weeks, we noticed she started to have some leakage problems again, so we put her back on the product and so far no problems.  We saw no side effects either.",5.0,0

Further, in this version, I could actually believe that Carton had found some semblence of peace and joy in the sacrifice he had made--dying--so that the person he loved would be happy. Up to then his life was a mess--dissipation, cynicism, and recklessness. It shows how genuine love can sometimes turn a person's life completely around.",5.0,0

I like the metal housing instead of the plastic of their cheaper models, and the vertical float allows it to fit in the 5 gallon bucket with room to spare.",5.0,0

This is just ... a mess. Overrun with mean-spiritedness, the vileness of the anti-female ramblings is matched only by the sub-amateur production values.
The writing is awful. The camerawork is headache-inducing. The acting would look bad on the stage of the worst gosapel stage show you ever saw.
Obviously, renting a camcorder and tripod from the local camera store does NOT qualify you as the next Spike Lee. If this is the best you can do, you're not even the next Matty Rich!

"With 1 large dog and 3 little ones, I have to keep up with the back yard. This is the best item I have found. Easy to use, handles the 'larger' situations very well. I wouldn't order a smaller one, this is the most logical purchase.",5.0,0
"Bottom Line - Convenient, lightweight, small, and most importantly SAFE for your pup.  Dog harness crash testing has a long way to go, and most products don't truly protect your dog from getting injured or injuring others during a crash.  This Sleepypod system is one of the few that is proven to work well.  You won't regret this purchase, and your canine friend will thank you for it.

Pros
-Tested and proven.  This is the most important criteria for me, and it was a must in my purchase of any vehicle harness.
-Does not require you to latch into the baby seat hooks.  It's as simple as stringing the seatbelt through the hoops.
-Lightweight and small enough to be utilized as a regular walking harness *for short walks.*  For instance, if I am making a quick run to my home department store and I want to take the dog, this Clickit can serve as a vehicle safety harness and a walking harness all in one.  I would not recommend it for long walks, running, or hikes, however, as it isn't nearly as nimble, lightweight, and breathable as other dedicated sport harnesses (and it isn't supposed to be).

Cons
-The leash clips don't have enough slack, so it's a little more difficult than it needs to be to clip a leash onto both D-rings.  Not impossible, but just more difficult than it needs to be.
-The adjustability is not quite where I would like it to be.  My dog has an interesting shape with a relatively large chest with a small neck.  We had to buy the medium due to her chest size and weight, but the neck adjustment is ever-so-slightly too large even when adjusted as tight as it can be.",5.0,0

"I purchased the Coolaroo Elevated Core for my cat and it is a nice size for him.  It is so small that it is a bit difficult to put on, so it is not easy to adjust.  It does not stay on very well.

I have had to use a different clasp on the top because it is hard to see the clasp on the collar.  I have tried other brands, but they all seem to have just the same problem.  I am having trouble adjusting the collar because it is not as big as I wanted it to be.  I was worried about my cat getting too close to the collar and getting it to go in the air.  It is very easy to adjust and I would recommend it.  I have a very hard time getting my cat to use it.  I would recommend this collar for a very hard and experienced cat.  If your cat is a big chewer, it is probably worth it.  I was very disappointed in this collar because the size was too large.  It is made from plastic and it is a bit difficult to put on, but it is perfect for my cat.  It is very soft and my cat is a little bit fussy.  I was surprised by the quality of the collar.

"So glad I bought this.  Went on vacation and came back at night time on a rainy day.  My basement drain was backing water up into my basement. , it was about 8"" high by the drain and it was just getting higher and higher - luckily my basement is sloped and not much damage was done.  Immediately I pulled this pump out and set it up to use it my first time.  Attached both hoses that I got for it, filled the top with water and put the strainer on the hose that I put into the water.  Immediately it started pumping water at a decent rate outside.  This kept the water level down (in fact, it drained all of it in about 1.5 hours) until I could get to Home Depot the next morning to rent a power snake and clear the clog.

"Nice packaging, and great communication from the seller. However, I wasn't pleased with the product itself. I ordered 9 of these bulbs and installed them in 3 ceiling fans in 3 different rooms. So this is not a review about a fluke bulb. First off, they have a delay when turning on. It's subtle, but it's there. I confirmed this by mixing other LED bulbs in a ceiling fan with one of these. These turn on a split second behind the other ones that are immediate on. Second, the color is very blue. I have many 5000k LED bulbs throughout my house. Base styles include: BR30, A19, E12 and G9. All of the other 5000k bulbs simulate (to me) natural daylight. These, however, have a much bluer tone to them. I've recently read that the blue in LED lights make people not be able to fall asleep. So, probably not the best for a bedroom. Aside from that, though, it wasn't a desirable color. Third, while I don't see a flicker while staring at the light, the room itself had a subtle disburance when these were on. With it dark outside, and only these lights being on, the room had a flutter to it. Sort of gave me a headache. Fourth, and last, these aren't very bright. All of my other 60w (equivalent) LED bulbs almost seem too bright at times. These, on the other hand, weren't bright enough. Three 60w bulbs in the ceiling fan of a 9x11 bedroom should be ample (It is with the incandescent bulbs), but with these it wasn't bright enough to read.",2.0,0

"Our house has one of these in the kitchen, the builder's electrical contractor dissuaded us from putting more in as ""they are easy to install and cost a fraction of what we charge you""  Well the first part is true, they are easy to install.  The second part is patently false as it cost $16 each for each installed unit in our house and as one can clearly see here they cost more!  However, when you are in the mess of building a house, little things like research can get swept under the rug with work and the myriad decisions one has to make in a hurry.

Like most homes today, ours is littered with device charges of different types, their power blocks and cables all over the place. Family and guests  are constantly vying for the coveted outlets that are high enough the dog can't get at the cords or devices when your back is turned!  This little gem, like the other in our kitchen allows 3 devices to charge at once if needed.  And keeps the wife's recipe book, I mean iPad, ever charged while she is cooking and looking along with her phone...and gives her an outlet for an appliance!

This receptacle is quick and easy to install, just make sure you turn the breaker off, so as not to end up in the ER or worse!  The instructions are spot on.

The USB port is 2.1 amp, so it charges fast.  Harder on the battery, yes, but fast.  iPhone 6+ went from zero to full in about 20 min, that is an estimate as I wasn't timing precisely.

I highly recommend this unit to anyone.",5.0,0

The sockets are great, the customer service associated with the TEXTON tool brand is excellent, but the case itself could have better design for longevity and sockets keeping where they should stay as you move the case with the door in the open position.

"This film reminded of ""The Hand that Rocks the Cradle."" George Harriman (Lou Felder) a poorly developed character has been terminated from his fictional movie company for embezzling and to top it all off he might go to prison. Like any white collar criminal faced with ""hard"" time in a federal pen, he opts to do the honorable thing and shoot his family and himself...except for some reason he omits his daughter who is a nurse (Lisa Zane as Laura Harriman ).

When George's former boss Bob (Michael Fairman) hears about it he goes catatonic, like Ned seeing the Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka (South Park season 2). Laura assumes a new identity to infiltrate the home as a nurse so she can bump off Bob's family in front of him.

The terror and acting were both lame. Except for the rare F-bomb, this could have been a made for TV movie. Perhaps my biggest disappointment was right after I obtained this film I discovered it was available in a multi-film pack for the same price.

I use it for home electronics work -- measuring AC and DC current, voltage, continuity, and so forth.  The build quality is excellent.
There is a very similar model for automotive use, but it doesn't provide accurate measurements for very small voltage and current, so not appropriate for electronics work.
There are also two other models in this line: the 175 which is just less accurate as far as I can tell, and the 179 which also offers a temperature sensor.
It's a little hokey the way the stand snaps against the main unit - sort of an uncomfortable friction fit -- and even when extended there isn't really a point where it snaps or cleanly stops.  It feels cheap but there may be a good reason they did it this way, perhaps it stands up better to heavy use and is less likely to break.
I also think it would have been nice to have an ON/OFF button, rather than have to rotate the dial all the way around to the left every time you want to turn it off.  There is an auto-off feature so you can just not turn it off if you want, though you'll use your battery up faster.
The leads that are provided are not premium - which is unfortunate considering the price of the device.  The wires are just not as pliable as I'd like, in that they want to retain their folded-up shape.  So I have ordered a set of more expensive replacement leads.
Also they don't provide any sort of alligator clips or any other attachment for the leads - just the bare metal points.  So again, I had to order those separately.
I'm still giving this five stars because I really love it ;-)",5.0,0

"If you have ever been to a bull riding event or just watched an event on the t.v. , you may of heard the name , Lane Frost .

"On the plus side, this movie serves up the most beautiful images of Italy. In fact, Italy is the star here. And I completely enjoyed all of the Italian actors who played smaller roles.  It's a pleasant, likeable, feel-good movie, and if that seems like damning with faint praise, that's because it is..  Very much a chick flick, which is not a put-down.  (And when did movies about relationships, feelings, romance come to be something to sneer at, anyway? )  There are no wizards here, no space aliens, no explosions, no threats to the future of the planet.  No violence at all.  The actors are all fine and Vanessa Redgrave is, as always, superb.  One exception is Christopher Egan, whose performance for most of the movie is over the top, which may be less inept acting than poor direction.

That being said, here's the downside:  It's going to remind you of a lightweight, made-for-tv romance of the type you can find on the Lifetime or Hallmark channel, just with a bigger budget.  The intrusive candy-pop music selections can't help but point you in that direction and make you think that perhaps it's targeted to junior high schoolers. I found myself wondering how Vanessa Redgrave had wandered into a piece of fluff like this.  The plot has more potential than substance as presented here and with each new development it's easy to predict what will happen next.  No real drama, yet no comedy either.  In fact, no tension, no suspense, no surprises, no energy or sizzle.  Which is why the best I can say about it is that it's okay.  Just okay.  But I would have been angry had I spent $10 or $12 to see it in a theater.

If you want to see a 'chick flick' that emotionally touches you, inspires you to think, has more than a passing impact, then I suggest you consider The Enchanted April or Mona Lisa Smile or the marvelous German film, Mostly Martha (the original, not the American remake).",3.0,0

"Jean Dujardin and Berenice Bejo, with director Michel Hazanavicius, did something entirely different here, completely unlike their award-winning work in The Artist. It's hard to believe this movie features the same three brilliant people.

Dujardin is brilliant at dumb-cluck-worthy mannerisms and quirks. Chasing bad guys down the back alleys of Cairo? You'd expect our hero, as heroes often do in their more suave and debonair incarnations, to run swiftly and with no uncertainty around corners, never slowing down or stopping. Not Agent 117...he has to stop completely, in a tense, crouching stance, in which he pivots, to look all directions, before he continues...not once, not twice, but at every single corner or intersection in the chase. I could go on and on, but I'm sure there are more wildly dumb and silly things going on than any could recount in one review.",5.0,0
"I was very pleased with the value of this trimmer.  It ran great right out of the box.  My only issue is that there isn't much line included, and it came loose one time and I had to stop to remove and reassemble the entire bobbin.  I found the forward loop handle to be a bit too small to easily balance and manuver the head, especially since a sholder/neck strap was not included.  After some practice, I got the hang of it, but I will be looking for a strap to add.

The Expand-It system promises to make this even more of a great value.

No issues with the reconditioned product, simply came in a brown box and has a ""RECON"" stamp in the plastic.

UPDATE:  After about 4 years of normal use and standard maintenance, this trimmer finally died on me.  Everything was in good working order, but for some reason the piston seized up and the connecting rod broke.  The oil was topped off and fresh, there were no indications of a pending failure.  I am really disappointed, but can't really complain.  I have since gone back to a 2-stroke trimmer because ultimately, for the application, the 4-stroke is a bad idea.",5.0,0

"Of the three Tunable White BR30 bulbs I bought three months ago, one is already dead.  (That's a really, really short life for an LED bulb!)

Even before that, there were a couple of flaws that really bothered me:

- Apparently, you can set the default color temperature if, and only if, you have the Sylvania hub.  I don't have the Sylvania hub; I'm using SmartThings.  With SmartThings, I'm stuck with 2700k lights (at initial power delivery); we wanted something closer to 6500k.  I don't really want to purchase a new, dedicated hub for a one-time settings pressing.  (This is absolutely a preference thing, but feel like there ought to be some other way to do this; you shouldn't have to buy a hub for a one-time use if they're going to tout compatibility with another hub!)

- Pairing mode is too easily triggered.  I have a toddler and on multiple occasions now, she's managed to put the bulbs back into pairing mode (which unpairs them from our hub).  GE Link bulbs' pairing process was an absolute pain, but we never accidentally triggered pairing with a few off/on toggles like we have with the Sylvania bulbs.

- The dimmest setting isn't as dim as Hue or LIFX bulbs (but seems to be on par with GE Link and Sengled).

- SmartThings Routines that trigger changes to brightness and color temperature sometimes only do one or the other.

Two of the three bulbs still work, but we're not really using them as smart, tunable bulbs because of the flaws listed above.",2.0,0

"Streamlight's UltraStinger is really in a niche by itself.  Mag Light's rechargeables aren't as bright and SureFire's are much more expensive, so the UltraStringer is really made for someone desiring a quality light that won't break the bank.
Some of the nice features of this light: It's very lightweight, very bright (75,000 candlepower), run time is very good for this much light output.  Well made, quality construction.
Some of the cons about this light:  Plastic lens (seems only SureFire will give you a genuine Pyrex, glass lens these days) and the spot/flood range isn't really that much of a difference (Mag's spot/flood produces a SPOT or a FLOOD).  The Streamlight has a very coarse adjustment range, really being all the same style output, with very LITTLE difference in the SPOT / FLOOD.  This isn't as bad as it sounds as the light produced is a very good, pure white light, I'd just like to see more variation in the range, but I'm being picky here.
One thing's for certain; this light is much better than Mag's rechargeable and a lesser light than SureFire's 8 or 9N rechargeable.  But, it's also half the price of the SureFire and 80% less than SureFire's 10-X.  So, I've got to give it 5 stars for being a great value, occupying a market not really served by either Mag or SureFire.

And the third act is not as satisfying as it could have been.

As a reviewer on Rottentomatoes mentioned, this is like a mashup of other classic sci-fi films. Terminator, 12 Monkeys and Firestarter immediately spring to mind.

"""Knowing"" (2009) is directed by Alex Proyas (Dark City, The Crow, I,Robot). This film is about a time capsule that is opened fifty years later with pictures drawn by children, however, one of the pictures drawn by a child was only filled with numbers.

"There is nothing like the return of the dragon/Satan in the form of a Tiamat cult. People (mostly dirty topless women) are becoming possessed across the world at an alarming rate. But don't worry, the Vatican was three priests who bombed out of drama class, so you know their good. Father Jan (Rudy Barrow) who had basic exorcism training, teams up with epidemiologist Daryl Lux (Liz Mente Bishop) who doesn't seem to like clothes. They are given all the creature comforts of a small trailer in a field to save the world because this is a low budget film.

This is a film you can take a nap in the middle and wake up and you haven't missed anything. The scenes are too long and there are too many scenes of possession, apparently wishing to cast every local gal willing to get dirty and take her blouse off. The back of the DVD gives out plot spoilers...if such a thing is possible.

The DVD is poorly made as the extras started right when the film was over, hence the deleted scene came on at the end of the feature as if it was a part of it. A bit confusing, but the nudity was nice.

"Proof positive that what makes as great movie is the writing.  Don't get me wrong, this film looks great, but you can tell it did not have the giant blockbuster budget that some films have, but the director and camera crew make it look like a million dollars anyway.  And more importantly it has fantastic script, mood, and great actors! This is a thnking man's, or woman's, movie. it is also very much in the film noir vein.  Films to compare it to would be Dark City or the first Boerne Identity movie.  Through out the movie our main character has identity issues and as has been stated previously, Jeremy Northam's tranformation is incredible, subtle, and in my opinion, Oscar worthy! It has been said by some that the plot has holes or doesn't make sense in places. I have plotted it out meticullously and i can find a hole anywhere.  Because the plot is involved it is a movie that gets better with repeated viewings. Much like watching ""The Usual Suspects"" for the second & third time. Something else I think is noteworthy is that while most of the movie is kind of cold and lonely,as it should be, as our hero goes on his quest where no one can be trusted, at the very end of the movie we are treated to a very warm, hopeful, satisfying ending. All the cast are perfect.  Lucy Lui has the perfect demeanor for this role. Many times it is hard to read her and thereby to know if she can be trusted.  Finally, let me end with stating this is in my Top-10 movies of all times along with the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly,  In the Mouth of Madness by John Carpenter, as well as many other horror and Sci-fi films.  I watched more times than I can count and will probably go watch it again here in a minute. A real treat for anyone who has not seen it yet!",5.0,0
"I didn't see this movie, but I thought it was good enough.

The movie has a couple of extra scenes, but most of the movie is just a background of how it's going to end. It's a fairly short movie. If you're looking for something short, you'll like this one. I think it's a pretty good movie, but you can't really go wrong with this one. I highly recommend it to any fan of the genre.This is a great movie to watch with my children, they enjoy it.

I don't want to name names because for all I know, they may HATE my reviews!
But, all kidding aside, this is a good movie. The actors were good, the writers were good; I guess almost everyone involved in getting this film out did a good job! The plot was creative and interesting and while I DID guess some of the outcomes, the ending came out of nowhere and really blew me away! I was NOT expecting that one and that's one of the things I love in a movie. Movies should be entertaining, have a good plot, have good actors (even if they're not well known), good direction and keep you interested from the first frame to the last and sometimes even give the viewer a great surprise they weren't expecting at all. This movie did all of that. I'd definitely recommend it and think it's worth both your time and your money.",4.0,0

"My cat, Raoul purchased this during a nocturnal shopping spree. We got him his own credit card with the hope that occasional nighttime internet shopping would entertain him while the rest of the household slept. This works out pretty well most of the time as he usually purchases small inexpensive items such as cans of tuna, bags of Pounce, and electronic dog whistles.

One night, however, he watched&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Amelia/dp/B0036SLOP8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Amelia</a>&nbsp;on Amazon Instant Video and he became extremely interested in flying.  For a few weeks he would climb up on to a tall bookcase and spring, legs outstretched, usually on to the sleeping dog, but sometimes at any unsuspecting passerby.  He must have eventually become bored with free flight because this Cat Airplane arrived one day. Raoul set upon assembling the cardboard pieces and although he was quite methodical, it was beyond his physical ability to complete the job. Of course, we assisted him; the propeller assembly being extremely difficult even for us with thumbs.

At last, the cat airplane was finished and the first thing we noticed is that the cockpit was rather a tight squeeze for a big fellah like Raoul.  He was quite determined and was barely able to squeeze himself in, but he eventually did.  Once in, he really looked fantastic! Purring like mad, he tried to find the controls, but there were none.  Thinking that he had mistakenly purchased a glider, he requested that we lift the plane (with him still inside) up to his usual bookcase perch and then give him a shove. Needless to say, we refused!

It took lots of explaining on our part to convince Raoul that he had not purchased a real plane but merely a toy. He is quite disillusioned now. He mostly sleeps or sits and stares off into the far distance, a cat with shattered dreams.

"Update:  I received the 600 Professional today.  First off,  this filter is very large.  It completely dwarfs both my Fluval 305 and
Marineland 350 Magnum.

I also notice that like my Fluval 305,  the Hydor is manufactured in Italy.  Something I find interesting,  given all of the aquarium
filters that are made in China.

The 600 PRO is well  constructed,  with five media baskets:  two for mechanical filtration and three for biological filtration.

The motor housing for this filter is solid and well designed, and the motor itself  is completely silent.

The motor head is secured to the 600 PRO's canister  with front and back clamps, as well as side levers which offer
a tighter seal.

Even the media trays have nice adjustable plastic straps which allow for easy removal of media, and the trays themselves fit snugly into the 600 PRO's chassis, stacked atop one another.

Aesthetically,  the entire  Hydor Professional series has a refreshingly industrial look,  which exudes quality.

The fact that this filter was discounted by about $80 from its list price only makes the aforesaid that much better.

If the Hydor 600 PRO stands up as well as my Fluval 305 and  Eheim Classic filters have, I will consider this to be money well spent.

Highly recommended!

I have been considering purchasing one of these filters since they came out.  However, they were selling at list price for quite awhile.
So I decided to wait  until the prices became more reasonable.  I just found a brand new 600 for sale on Amazon for about $150, so I decided to purchase it.  Will update my experiences.  Based on what I have read about these filters thus far, I've left four stars.

This is the largest canister filter I have ever purchased.  I also own a Marineland Magnum 350 and a pair of Fluval 305s (350 GPH VS 260 GPH respectively), so at 345 GPH this will be about as large as the Magnum 350, even though the 600 dwarfs the 350 in size.",5.0,0

"First let me say that I wish they'd allow us to rate half-star intervals here; I'd have given this another half-star, mostly due to the great lines given to Arye Gross. I never heard of the guy before, but he's hilarious  here in the role of unlikely hero (that also doesn't want to be hero). Reminds me just a little of the Ash character in ""Army of  Darkness"" or the Jack Burton character in ""Big Trouble in Little  China"". It's Arye Gross' performance that raises this film above  mediocrity. Without his character, the movie would be a plain-jane sci-fi  movie with nothing special about it. Except Maryam D'Abo, whose  sexiness could almost carry the whole thing by itself. Mind you, the  character she plays isn't a particularly sexy character, but her subtle  beauty shows through anyway, and between her and Gross, there is always  something worth watching going on. The supporting cast, Jeff Speakman,  etc. , perform quite well also, and the bad guys are convincingly  evil-looking. The production standards are strictly B-movie however. Special effects are okay but not great, and the settings are sort of  cliched. There are several close-up shots of an asteroid that is pretty  obviously a miniature, but it adds a little charm to it that way--kind of  like watching an old sci-fi movie from the 50's. But understand that I  don't think this movie is trying to be anything but a B-movie. All in  all a standard sci-fi movie with great humor sprinkled throughout. I  laughed out loud many times while watching it. It's worth spending money  on, but just don't expect Oscar-winning stuff here. And now I have to go  see what other movies Arye Gross has been in.

"When it comes to B-movies, Bloodsucking Freaks is ranked right up there with the best of them. What more could you want from a film? It has sex, violence, lots of nudity, and a crazed afro-wearing midget. Don't let the title fool you though. This movie has nothing to do with vampires, in fact except for one great scene, there really isn't much bloodsucking at all. The scene I speak of is the 'doctor' and his 'operation'. A beautiful nude blonde is strapped to a chair. First the doc pulls all her teeth out with a pair of pliers (this is to ensure she doesn't bite). Then he shaves the top of her head, drills a hole through the center of her skull, inserts a tube and sucks out the blood and gray matter. Fascinating.

There are so many scenes in this movie it is difficult to describe them all. The spanking guillotine scene is a favorite of mine, espescially what the midget does with the head after he takes it out of the basket. The midget is one weird little dude, he has a craving for human eyes, always wins at backgammon (another great scene) and is a hell of a little cymbal player.

The plot for this flick is pretty simple. A weird dude operates an S&M torture show in New York. This is a front for his white slavery business. When he's not performing with his cast, he simply tortures whoever is available. He has a cage of cannibalistic wenches that he keeps locked up too. They are good for disposing of any unwanted snoops.

Even the cop who finally busts him gets eaten. There are no winners here, good guys and bad guys die alike. Well the cannibal women do get free and eat their master, so I guess that's good. The final scene before the 'THE END' pops up is hilarious. You'll never eat a hot dog again without thinking of 'Bloodsucking Freaks'.

"Bought this sturdy 1/2"" shank bit to create my own Slatwall shelving from an unused laminated kitchen shelf. I only needed a couple of shelves for the limited space and buying a full sheet of Slatwall was prohibitively expensive and would delay the project.

Technically, this cuts a T-slot that's a bit larger than true Slatwall, but it works.

I ran the melamine shelf board through my table saw with the blade raised to just under the depth of the cutter's eventual depth. Then I moved the fence over and cut it again to create a 1/4"" dado. This removed a good deal of material so the cutter didn't have to work so hard.

I then used my router table and its rip fence to create the T-slot. Cut some scrap first to assure the proper depth. Worked like a charm.

A 2'x4' piece of Slatwall goes for $58. This $18 cutter and some scrap 3/4"" melamine did the trick and I can use the cutter again for a long time. And I have no unusable leftover Slatwall pieces. Nor did I have to wait for the Slatwall to be delivered. (It's not stocked locally.)

I already had some Slatwall 6"" shelf brackets I got at Amazon at for a previous project.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/KC-Store-Fixtures-A01724-Slatwall-Shelf-Bracket-6-34-Black-Pack-of-25/dp/B013KA7UI6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">KC Store Fixtures A01724 Slatwall Shelf Bracket, 6"", Black (Pack of 25)</a>

As you can see, you must purchase 25 of them at a time. I had already used 20 of them in my pantry so the five leftovers went to this project. Perfect.

I cut some 9/16"" thick shelves from some old 1x12s I had salvaged from an old project and planed them down from 3/4"", then sprayed some water-based MinWax Polycrylic on them for protection.

Obviously, this cutter is only economical if you already have the other tools. But it's a great economical addition to my router bit collection.",5.0,0
"The Bottoms Up was difficult for us, probably because of the 65 pound weight of our dog. I imagine it would be much easier with a smaller dog. Holding that much weight with just one arm is tough, and we guessed that the straps weren't comfortable for the dog.  Having to put it on each time we took him out wasn't convenient either.
We switched to a harness that fits on the back somewhat like a girdle. We put it on in the morning and it stays on all day. All we have to do to go out is to snap handles on. And, since there's two handles we can share the load. I'm sure it's more comfortable for the dog since the weight is distributed over a large area, rather than the two straps on the Bottoms Up.",3.0,0
"I've had them all. Lenox, Milwaukee, Husky, Kobalt, Irwin etc. This is the best one. One little mod I like to do is take the shaft and bits from the Kline 11 in 1 and put it in the beefier bigger handle of this 10 in 1 to get that extra bit. I don't know why they didn't just sell it this way to begin with but either way this is the best heavy duty multi bit screwdriver you can buy. The handle is literally the perfect size for big jobs where extra tourque is needed, and helps you gain more control for when you need to ""feel"" the fasteners for sensitive jobs where stripping the head or over tightening is a concern. Also the driver is not too heavy or big to be overly cumbersome in a back pocket which is a preferred method of carrying it when I'm running around. The only negative I can think of is the klien oem replacement bits are expensive. You can find similar replacement bits from different manufacturers cheaper, stock up on some of the common ones as you may loose some. Another plus of doing this is you can buy other bits such as the double ECX bits Milwaukee sells and throw that in place of your torx bit or other bit you don't use a lot. You can readily customize this for one big task or just keep the different fastener bits in your tool bag handy so you don't need a bunch of various screw drivers as you can buy almost any bit tip for any screwdriver and just throw them in this screwdriver and still have 6 other sizes in your pocket.

"I was an electrician/electrical contractor for 25 years. I was not some fly-by-night residential sleazoid either. I ran multi-million dollar jobs and did both commercial and industrial trouble-shooting. I state without fear of contradiction, by my peers, that this tool is IT. This is the best hacksaw ever made unless perhaps it is the OTHER Lennox high tension hacksaw frame. If you like your fingers buy a 32 tooth blade. (I always favored the Lennox blades as well)

Why is this so good? The frame is made of strong aluminium alloy with a hollow steel top bar in which the blades are stored. The tensioning device is not a wingnut for fingers,or a screw for a tool, but a crank that folds up and out of the way. The balance is not quite as good as the old Kleins, but those are long gone and were not not nearly so convenient; (screw tensioner, round top bar that eventually bends. losing tension) When I bought my first Lennox for some $60 bucks I shouted ""Hossana!"". The tooth size is measured in number of teeth per inch. Evil contractors buying 24 tooth blades to speed production when I was an apprentice,accounts for why I have a permanent groove and partial feeling in my left thumb. Why? Because they do not cut smoothly and tend to hop out of the cut and onto you. Buy the 32 tooth blades as they do not have such a tendency to jump out of the cut.

The only weakness in this design is the spare blade keeper. It is or was a threaded screw tightened by hand. To improve this I drilled and threaded the hole to a 1/4""X20 hole with a 1/2"" 1/4-20 screw in the hole for better function. If the hole is far enough forward it will go entirely through the frame, and thread on the frame rather than the steel top bar. This is a piddling concern. This is the best hacksaw made.",5.0,0

"The movie's time frame, setting and plot are all similar to Command Decision, another fine wartime drama about air combat. But this one features a different cast and much more action. Gregory Peck plays Brigadier Gen. Frank Savage, who is given a critical task. In 1942 in England, early in World War II, he must restore the effectiveness and morale of the men of the 918th bomber group while replacing their beloved commander, Gen. Keith Davenport (Gary Merrill). The way he does so is tremendously difficult for both him and his men, but given what's at stake - possibly the outcome of the war - you can see that he has no choice. This movie was cited most often by members of the U.S. 8th Air Force as the most accurate representation of their lives and missions dramatized on film. Written by Beirne Lay, Jr. and Sy Bartlett from their novel, it is an intelligent, highly thoughtful portrayal of the stresses of command in wartime, and it's a tribute to the quiet but amazing heroism of the men who flew bombing missions against Germany. The 12-minute combat sequence featuring B-17 bombers against Messerschmitt and Focke-Wulf fighters is incredibly harrowing and more realistic than anything else on film - because it is real battle footage. Dean Jagger won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his portrayal of Peck's top aide, and Peck himself is terrific, as are Millard Mitchell as the Air Force commander in England, and Hugh Marlowe (in possibly his best role) as a trouble-plagued pilot.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Phil-s-Favorite-500-Loves-of-a-Moviegoing-Lifetime-2014-edition/dp/B00HU8VK4K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Phil's Favorite 500: Loves of a Moviegoing Lifetime (2014 edition)</a>",4.0,0

"""Laurel Canyon"" is an entrancing languid film about the intersection of individuals and lifestyles.
Briefly, the film covers the relationship between a young professional couple who have been studying at Harvard played by (Sam) Christian Bale and (Alex) Kate Beckinsale and the lifestyle of Sam's record producer mother Jane (Frances Mc Dormand) and her younger boyfriend Ian (Allesandro Nivola).  The Harvard culture is conservative and polite whereas Jane's Los Angeles culture is uninhibited and hedonistic.  Sam is embarrassed by his mother while Alex is slowly drawn in like a moth to a flame.
The couple comes to within a hair's breadth of falling apart but it is Sam who first recognises problems and temptations when he resists an attractive work colleague Sara played by Natasha Mc Elhone.  He then confronts his partner who steps back from the edge of a moral abyss.  Sense is ultimately seen by all and the two lifestyles choose to recognise and respect their differences.
The plot is virtually non-existent.  Rather, the film is a study of the simmering tensions between two very different ways of life.  It is this tension that sustains the film.",4.0,0
"Lately I have been trying to put together affordable every day (EDC) pen lights among some other stronger lumen tactical lights for other applications. I recently bought the Milwaukee pen light and this Coast pen light to compare. This Coast Pen Light is definitely a focused light, just like its advertised, a focused light for closer ranges, because your beam makes a perfect circle, a perfect circumference, and the closer the object is the more intense the light is. The further you shine your light out, the bigger your circle gets and the weaker that intensity is; whereas with the Milwaukee pen light get a consistent brighter light no matter how far you shine it and you get a wider area of coverage. I can shine up my backyard pretty good with the Milwaukee light than the Coast Pen Light thats for sure.
Im glad I bought both lights to test out how I would use them when I needed too. They are both affordable and both are good lights, but out of the two, I would carry the Milwaukee everyday and leave my Coast light by my nightstand. To me, that is where the Coast Pen Light would come in handier, when you need to find something closer to you near in the dark. Now I am going to save up and purchase a bit more expensive rechargeable Streamlight Pen Light.
Another recommendation I would make is to invest in some really good rechargeable batteries, like the Panasonic Eneloop Pros and get yourself a smart charger as well, where you can make setting adjustment for your batteries and tests your batteries.",5.0,0

"Everlasting Fun Treat Ball / B0009YD8NS

I have several treat dispensing toys for my puppy, and I like this one the least. The design is very poor, in my opinion, at least compared to other treat toys we've used. To begin with, it is difficult to ""load"" the toy with food and treats because there are two identical loading holes, one opposite the other. This means that when I pour treats in, they pour right out on the opposite side. It's like filling a bucket with no bottom, and it's very frustrating. Eventually, you have to just find the biggest treats you can, and jam them in, which is a pain and a half. Not to mention the edges of the hole catch and grab at your fingers - fun!

That brings me to my next point - you cannot put small treats or puppy kibble in here as they will fall out immediately. Only big fat treats will provide the dog a challenge, but fortunately the makers of this product make such treats and are more than willing to sell them to you. Which is fine, I guess, and I went ahead and bought some, but I prefer to fill my treat toys with at least some regular kibble so that the puppy doesn't just gorge himself on a bunch of rich treats all at once. Since this ball won't allow me to do this, it's now an occasional toy, not a reliable daily toy. Bottom line: I feel that this toy is difficult to fill, and can only be used for ""treat gorging"" and not for regular dinner time. If your fingers are less delicate than mine and you just want a treat ball, you may like this - my dog certainly likes the chewy rubber and he hasn't destroyed it yet (although he's not much of a chewer). However, if you want an easy to fill ball that can hold kibble and enliven dinner time, I recommend the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Omega-Paw-Tricky-Treat-Ball/dp/B0002DK26M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Omega Paw Tricky Treat Ball</a>.",3.0,0

It helps me burn her energy more effectively then a regular short leash walk (since I'm not a runner). I've taught her directions such as left, right, stop, back, let's go, etc. so she still has to follow my lead. It's been very durable and has NOT jammed even when fully extended.

I only had one surprise with the DeWalt and that was that the clutch functions only on the high speed setting.

I received my package today and check on the content and what I found out - all that was originally released for the Special Editions of Toy Story 1 & 2 Blu-Ray are all there.

"I own 4 Mini Schnauzers.  This doggy door has been a dream.  We installed it on the ground level of our basement door.  I am no longer a door man for my dogs.  Yah!  My dogs learned to be completely potty trained by 4 months of age, since they could go outside when they needed to go.  The 2 flaps close fairly reliably to keep out the bitter cold.  This ends up to be quite an energy saver since only a little air gets in the house.  Compare that to the amount of air that comes in the house when you have to open a door for a dog to go outside.

Here is the drawback.  My dogs love to grab shoes and anything else they can find and drag it out to the back yard.  I have to go out regularly to pick up the things they drag out there.  I also have to close the door occasionally since they can start to dig holes in the yard if given too much outdoor freedom.  I also close the door occasionally so the dogs won't bark at neighbors.  That is OK with me.  Overall this doggy door gives me and the dogs so much more freedom to do our thing!  Yes I do love it!",5.0,0

"I'm not a comic reader and have never read the ones for Spiderman, I'm more of a movie fan so if you are looking for a review that compares this movie to the comics this review may not be helpful for that.  I have watched the Spiderman trilogy that came out in the 2000s and thought they were pretty well done, but for some reason I enjoyed this Spiderman more.  For example, I found the character of Spiderman rather annoying in the trilogy whereas I could relate to his character better in this one.  I also like how this version had more background to the story as it started off with Peter Parker as a child living with his parents and touches a little bit upon his dad and how he was a very secretive man.  I also found the relationship between Peter Parker and Mary Jane really annoying in the Trilogy but the relationship he had with Gwen Stacy was more realistic and not over dramatized.  The fighting scenes were typical superhero style of fast paced and lots of smashing with the hero seeming to be the weaker out of the two but that is what is expected from these movies.  Of course there were many similarities played out differently in this movie when compared to the first of the older Trilogy.  For example, the spider bite, the fate of the uncle, Peter letting a thieve go due to his irritation with the person being robbed, the split personality of the villain, and so on.  They were just played out quite differently.  Peter Parker in this movie was also much funnier I thought; especially when he is dealing with the car thieve.  I found it to be an overall enjoyable movie and just about anyone who likes action will like it and my 6-year-old son really enjoyed it so it is a good movie for the younger generation.",5.0,0

"This movie is my favorite ever. The scenery is beautiful, the acting is extraordinary, the narration is poetic. Babette's feast is not some ""movie with a message"" otherwise it wouldn't be any good. But it's so real and poignant that much truth can be seen in it, spiritual truth and insights which shed light onto human nature. The relationships are very natural and believable, but the style of narration keeps the story from any kind of overly-subjective viewpoint which infects many movies which delve into human relationships. The actions and conversations arise very naturally and advance the plot superbly.
Another thing which I love about the movie is that it reveals something about the nature of good, evil, grace and redemption. None of the acting characters in the movie are ""evil""; however many are infected with smaller sins of pettiness, lack of generosity, glorying in the defeat of others, scrupulosity, jealousy, etc. This movie shows how these defects - small but many - have taken all the joy and pleasure out of life for those suffering under them and that to forgive and be forgiven is necessary to restore the joy of life. Grace, in this case the gift of Babette, is necessary to occasion the redemptive action.",5.0,0

"This Swedish comedy is set in 1970 and takes a look at life in a commune in Stockholm. Elisabeth (Lisa Lindgren) runs away from her drunken husband, Rolf (Michael Nyqvist), after he hits her in the face, taking along her 13-year-old daughter and son who is eight or nine. They land up with Elizabeth's brother who lives in a hippie commune where the members are all committed to socialism, vegetarianism, feminism and open-marriage but cannot agree whose turn it is to do the washing up.

The poor kids feel humiliated and estranged among a bunch of immature adults -- and their father's efforts to win back their trust only make things worse. But slowly they begin forming relationships with other kids their own age. Meanwhile Elizabeth is introduced to feminist ideas expressed by the radical notion of allowing her underarm hair to grow. We soon learn that behind the empty slogans of the hippies lies deep hypocrisy -- and we eventually learn what it takes to form a real community bound by ties of love and affection. Along the way there are many funny moments.

What I liked about this movie, apart from the Abba soundtrack, is that the characters change and grow -- and that the ideological points it makes are delivered subtly instead of being hammered home.",4.0,0
"Its a good filter, easy to install, made of lightweight plastic (a good thing because it will not make the shower pipe droop down like the old heavy ones did) and it completely eliminates all the smell of chlorine and everyone stopped complaining of dry itchy skin after I installed it.

The only tip I should pass along is that the you install a new one, do instal the hose and point the hose at the drain, as close as you can get to the drain) then slowly turn up the water. The first few seconds that the water is running it will throw out some carbon from this filter. The carbon is, of course, completely harmless but its particles are so small that will get trapped in the texture of your shower floor and leave a black mark. It eventually goes away but it might be noticeable to some people.

The other tip I can offer is that this is an effective filter but it clogs up easily. There are only two of us that use the one in the master bath and it only lasts 4 months (once it lasted 5 months, I got al excited but the next one only lasted 5 months again). I do wish that it lasted longer because I have having to recycle the perfect shell, but that is a small wish for future versions.

"By reputation, Meryl Streep seals her legend in this hardly observed crime who-dunnit receiving no Oscar nod or Academy mention for a performance that is astoundingly real in its exactness in the character of Lindy Chamberlain charged with the murder of her own daughter in the Australia back water, near Alice Springs, along with her husband Michael (Sam Neill), both devout Christians, a case that was solved a year after the picture's release. It is one thing to capture the virtuosity of Streep, but to present the trials and tribulations of innocent, accused parents under the microscope of media and bombarded by innuendo at every turn wearing testimony and beliefs to the pressure point is an extraordinary piece of cinema. If you followed this film with ""Silkwood"" you would see two distinct individuals played by the same actress. And, of course, Meryl Streep continues to stretch our imaginations. The supporting cast is familiar to those who fancy Australian offerings. However, this film is unique in its documentary feel with artistic touches, like complete authenticity to the decent character of the principals, that heighten its impact. Here, the viewers as well as the lead characters are tested by fire and survive. This is a Streep performance you must see.",5.0,0

"This review is for the Mighty Paw Leather Dog Collar.

I purchased this for my new puppy. My dog's old collar was wearing out and I came across this one and decided to try it. It looks good and seems to be made of solid material. I purchased the matching leash to go with it. I have a 6 month old bichon frise puppy and the collar was too big for him - I grabbed a pair of scissors and pierced a hole (took a few minutes to pierce through which tells me the material is good) and I cut the length as well. I did not measure the collar so not sure if the length is correct or not (as advertised) thus did not take any stars away for this.

"I have two bomb-dropping male cats. These boys seem to enjoy stinking up my office, which is the only place their litter box fits in my home. I prefer natural-everything but couldn't stand the terrible smell emitted from the litter box that stayed long after scooping. I've been using Tidy Cats clay litter which not only creates a lot of dust but tracks all over my damn house. On a whim, I decided to try this brand of pellets. What I've found is that the optimum freshness occurs when I pour about 2/3 of this product and then 1/3 of the tidy cats on top. The cats mix it together when they bury their treasure, and I haven't had ANY odor issues. I also don't have the excessive tracking anymore.

"I cannot explain how incredibly fantastic it is to have the love of my life (my little Buddy) tucked safely away in his sleepypod while driving.

"The best thing about this DVD: a chance to be introduced to some of most wonderful music beyond the standard repertory.  As someone forever seeking something I haven't heard before, this score was something of a revelation.  And this is greatly to the credit of William Christie, and his superb group of singers (Piau, Naouri, d'Oustrac, Piolino, Lehtipuu) who were fully engaged and demonstrated that there is much fine singing beyond the Three Tenors world.

However: the staging is just soooo tiresome!  It starts off amusingly with white projections that end up built up like a three tier cake with dancers and singers coming and going through them.  Unfortunately then you realize that's all it's going to happen, with singers mainly in the forefront while all the dancing and projections are going on in the background non stop.  I'm sure in the theater this might have been very distracting.  On video at least the camera can focus mainly on the singers and ignore most of the extraneous business during their arias.

If you curious of the music you should seriously explore the music on CDs; however if this is your only option, view a borrowed copy to make sure you know what you're getting.  It ain't cheap.  Were it not for the wonderful music, I would have tossed it out long ago.",2.0,0

"I bought this light not knowing what to expect so from the beginning:  Packing was great; the light arrives in a hard case that has fitted inserts that hold everything in place safely and comfortably, no hassle getting charger, light, and strap in and out. Next, accessories that come with the light, besides the hard case, the light comes with everything you need for getting started I especially like the shoulder strap that it comes with, the light is larger and heavier than I expected and when Im working with it for extended periods of time it starts to get heavy. The flashlight comes with attachment points for the shoulder strap so they thought that part out well. The light itself is brighter than some construction site wobble lights Ive used and is capable of lighting up entire room(s) by just standing it up in the middle of the room and letting the light bounce of the ceiling and walls which is very impressive. Outside, the light throws out a powerful beam that (I use it in a pitch dark 5 acre property) is the best that Ive experienced.

Finally, the flashlight has a battery indicator that really comes in handy so I don't get caught short of charge.",5.0,0

I figured they would be fair to moderately bright and maybe be able to be changed from white to colors. I had no idea that they were programmable, had presets you can make, the controls are more than robust, they are amazing! As you can see in the video and photos these things can be made to shine brighter or dimmer, and any color combination you can think of or of course the solid colors of Red, Yellow, Green, and Blue. The ability to change the settings are endless and was fun to play with.
What I like is these are bright enough to be used to illuminate a work bench or a working area, and also as decorative lighting like I am going to use them for.
These LED lights are more than I had hoped for and are amazing for the price. They are on a strip which you can cut to length and is adhesive backed. I will be using some extra strength double sided tape to help hold it in place.

If you need LED strip lighting for indoor use, this is definitely something you can use and able to do more than people think! My son wants some now for his room to put up.

"I've loved this movie since the first time I saw it in theater.  Its Andrew Dice Clay's first feature film and it delivers the typical Dice-persona antics.  Yes he had many misogynistic jokes at the time, but I separate this movie from his comedy; I mean, he takes care of a koala bear in the movie, how mean could he be?

The movie is about his character Ford Fairlane, a rockabilly style detective who works on cases for rock stars.  The only problem is most of his clients pay him in things other than money, such as guitars, sex, etc...

He comes across a case that involves finding 3 different cds or something like that.  I mean, they actually tried to put a plot in this movie, but you could have had a movie alone with just the main characters antics.  In a classic scene, Ford wakes up with two women in his bed and as the women start to leave he pleasingly begs them, ""hey girls, make breakfast, do my laundry""; classic stuff.

Eventually, Wayne Newton shows up as the bad guy and we are treated to scenes of Ford Fairlane making witty remarks towards Wayne Newton's character(Julien Grendel).

If you want to brush up on classic 90s films or just a decent comedy in general, check this one out.  His comedic style may or may not work for you, but I think if you start watching it and your entertained you'll be pleased with this one.",4.0,0

"I am a big fan of the underrated, marvellously talented late Robert Lancing, so I collect his stuff.  And he did some wonderful B flicks that are B Movie Addicts delight.  My favourite 4D man is one of the best, but this one is not too shabby.
Joan Collins is head of a group pushing an island paradise resort - yet to be built - and Lancing is the pilot of the boat that brings in the latest boatload of suckers....I mean investors...to view the imaginary golf course and club house.  Only problem, refugees from THEM! are lurking in the woods making off with islanders and soon to investors of Joan's resort.  The effects are typical Drive-in B movie quality (but hey, I miss the old drive-ins!! When I visited Kentucky they would have dusk to dawn creature features and that is where I first saw this movie), but Lancing as always is better than the material he is given and makes this worth the ticket.
So stack up four of five our your best Vincent Price and Chris Lee films, add Empire of the Ants (and watch the wonderful and well missed Robert Lancing), pop a bowl of popcorn , turn out the lights and imagine you are in a car with a speaker hanging from the window.

- Remove the top of the plastic cap.  The plastic cap is so thin it's barely noticeable.  If you have a large head, it might be OK to remove the plastic cap.  If your head is larger, it might be OK to remove the plastic cap.
- Remove the plastic cap from the handle.  The handle is too large for a small head.  The plastic cap is too small for a small head.
- Remove the plastic cap from the handle.  The plastic cap is too small for a small head.  The plastic cap is too small for a small head.

The plastic cap is made of thin plastic.  I've had it for a few months now and the plastic cap is still holding good.  If you need to remove the plastic cap, you'll have to buy a different plastic cap.  Just make sure you have a small, clean plastic cap.

I'm always checking the price of products and would recommend this product to anyone.

One thing to keep in mind is that the plastic cap is not made of plastic.  It is made of a plastic material, which means it's not solid.  If it falls off, you can still get a plastic cap.  But if you try to remove the plastic cap, it might be OK to remove the plastic cap.  I would suggest you do this because the plastic cap is so thin, so you can easily get a plastic cap.

"I'm glad I'm not the only one who found this movie ridiculously boring and ill-paced.  I'm also glad that Kip Pardue has disappeared from film, since his presence was an ink stain on anything he graced.  He is just so dull.  This flick doesn't do him any favors.  Sure, the racing sequences are exciting, but they are all so overdone and glossy that they lose their edge and become preposterous eye-soars.  The remainder of the cast is also a mess.  Estella Warren makes a pretty bland romantic interest.  She's cute enough, but she's also ridiculously dull.  Sylvester Stallone has never been `talented' in this area, and he doesn't bring any of the glimmers of promise he mustered out of that overrated 1976 boxing flick.  Instead, he grumbles through this film as if he was merely tolerating it.  The only shimmer of light comes from a predictably catty Gina Gershon who is always a delight, regardless of the fact that she can't seem to play more than one shade of character.  In the end, this tiresome bore is far from worth the price of admission.

"I purchased this nailer after my Dewalt 18v finish nailer decided to take a vacation. I install doors for a living, and needed a nailer with enough stank behind it to countersink nails through 5/4 material. I almost purchased a new Dewalt but this Ryobi had decent reviews, a comparable warranty, but a much better price point. All of my hand tools are Ryobi so I had more than enough batteries/chargers on hand. My experience with Ryobi tools has been a positive one. I'm extremely rough on my equipment, and they have all held up to the beating. Anyway, this nailer is OK. If you're using it for the occasional project, and don't mind having a few floating nails, it'll do just fine. This nailer however, did not meet my expectations. Didn't matter if I was using 2 inch nails or 2 1/2....didn't matter if I was nailing into a low profile interior trim, or thicker 5/4 material...didn't matter if I had the depth as deep as it would go and the compression gauge all the way to max...didn't matter how I held the gun against the material...it just wouldn't countersink the nails consistently. Maybe 6/10 successful countersinking. That meant more time manually punching nails and filling holes. Another issue I was having was the constant ""skipping"" off the nail head causing basically 2 holes to puddy AND the nail head was not countersunk. That didn't happen too often, but it was enough to make me say aloud, ""what the???"" The price listed above is insane- I picked up mine at the Home Depot for $200. It's possible I just had a defective product, because all the other reviews I've read were glowing for this exact same product. It's possible it was defective, but it's possible the next one will be too- so I'm going to purchase the newer Senco F16. Same conveniences, still less than Dewalt, and looks like a space-gun.

"For the most part this thing works by catching food and water from spilling out from the bowls. There are a few annoyances with this feeder, however:

- The top light part and the bottom dark part are two separate pieces with no clips or latches. it simply sit's on top loosely and my 8 week old puppy has pushed it out from the bottom part a few times.

- There are no easy way to pick this tray up. If you grab the top part you'll simply lift it away from the bottom part. You'll have to use to hands or hold at an awkward angle to pick up both trays.

- The rubber feets are loose and not securely attached to the tray. One fell out at some point and now the tray wobbles when the puppy tries to eat.

- The last thing is the bowls are very light or it has no method to secure the bowls from moving around when the dog tries to eat or simply being lifted completely out of the hole.

These things hard to see from the listing and only discovered after using for a week. It still works fine besides those annoyances. Some pros are my puppy likes to bite the walls like a chew toy.",3.0,0

"These are nice clippers. I'm not a professional, but shave my dog down regularly, and have tried  a number of different products. These clippers are fine, and they work nicely. What I'm not so sure about is the price. I'd suggest two other options:

It works exactly the same, and also feels like a high quality clipper (way better than the cheap Wahl human/home clippers I have). It's not the highest-end Andis clipper (they have ones that cost more which are designed for professional settings), bit it feels and works every bit as good as this one for me. It's only one speed, but I don't see the need for two speeds for most uses anyway. That Andis clipper is about half the price of this one, and includes a case, and four-piece comb set (#1-4).

Also, note that there are two difference blade sizes for Wahl clippers. The ones designed for animal usage have longer combs which do not fit the cheaper (and not awesome) home Wahl clippers that many people may have. The animal ones are interchangeable with Andis (I used my Andis combs on this one for testing).

"I installed this thermostat in my house and it has worked flawlessly.

The only downside is that it's very dimmable, which is annoying, but not a problem.

The thermostat is in a large, multi-function unit with an LED display. The display is a 2-way switch, so it can be switched between one mode and another if needed. I just turned on the first mode and it is on again.

This thermostat is about 30 years old, so the display is a little too large for my small apartment.

You can't really use it for that, because it's only about 10 watts.

"I am a full time dog trainer and I ordered this pouch in June. I wore this for 40 hours a week so I have to give some credit there, it held up pretty well for the amount of use. However, almost immediately the metal ring that stopped the cinch came out of the side of the bag and started to fray the material. I also did not have very good luck with the two sewn on straps next to the metal clip. They came out within the first month of me wearing the pouch. I had to use the cinch fairly often because dogs would find the pouch and stick their snoot in while I was talking to the owners, so I would cinch it closed. I finally ordered a new pouch in November (Doggone Good), so it took 6 months before I couldn't wear it any longer.

However, I did enjoy several features of the pouch which it seems my new pouch does not have. I could fit my iPhone 6 in the front zipper pocket easily so I could pull it out when I needed to make appointments or phone calls. As a woman, my pockets are very small so I am not sure where I am going to put my phone now. I also love the waste bag dispenser. I wholesaled ordered a bunch of waste bags so I was able to keep 3-5 rolls on me at a time, I never ran out. My new pouch only has room for two rolls. The metal clip on the back, even though I did not have the sewn straps, was very convenient and I could clip and unclip it from my belt very easily. I also liked that I could slip little things into the front mesh pocket, like prong collar links. So the bag isn't awful for the average dog owner, but won't withstand professional use.

I have purchased this item twice from Enzsmart. I received the product pictured and advertised both times from Enzsmart. A third purchase from another supplier (when Enzsmart was out of stock) was an inferior unbranded ""knockoff"" in almost all respects.

The foregoing my well explain the widely differing customer opinions of this and other popular China made flashlights, here at Amazon. To paraphrase Forrest Gump: 'Buying these things is like selecting a candy from a box of assorted chocolates. You never know exactly what you will get.'

At a delivered price of often under $11.00 these lights are a tremendous value. A bare, LED only, repair part CREE XM-L T6 LED will cost you about $10.00! Even the inferior unbranded ""knockoff"" was not a bad buy; but not what was ordered. Ultimately, I settled with the supplier for a 30% refund; but would have rather have paid full price for what was advertised. I will not likely use subject supplier again without prior assurance that I will receive what is actually advertised when I order.

{If the branded products received in plain white box packaging (marked FAH502B) were ""knockoffs"" or seconds; they were very high quality ones. By the way the UltraFire ""WF-502B"" is a actually flashlight body model that can accept several lamp modules. The ""XM-L T6"" is a specific model of the CREE brand LED that is claimed to be capable of producing about 1000 lumens @ 10 watts. CREE appears to sell inferior seconds or have counterfeiters that do not begin to equal CREE for quality.}

The model actually shown and described in the ad is a very powerful tactical flashlight. I do not possess the necessary test equipment to accurately measure its light output in lumens; but it actually draws about 9 watts at about 4 volts from a freshly charged 18650 cell. The real world light output is likely over 800 lumens, which is a lot of light for a compact tactical type flashlight.",5.0,0

"This....was one of the movies I have seen so many times from 2005-2009 that I found myself able to practically recite the entire movie by memory despite not having viewed it since then. During that time, I was immersed in anything 'samurai' related, so this film was, of course, going to be a personal favorite of mine. Now that I'm a bit more mature, however, I find enjoyment in the more subtle, underlying themes, and the Native American backstory of the protagonist. Either way, I am happy with this purchase.",5.0,0

"Having shopped for more expensive dog booties, we were pleasantly surprised by how well these have worked.

Big Pluses:
1. easy on and off
2. our dog got used to them in just a few days of short walks (man was this funny at first)
3. stayed on as long as they were pretty tightly snugged up, in terms of the velcro
4. totally did the job of protecting her feet.

Note that we used these while backpacking for a week in Colorado. You could use these around town, but in my experience dog feet can toughen up quite a bit with regular walking.

Anyway: good booties.",5.0,0

"I had considered one of these kinds of cat litter boxes for a long time but always figured my cats would probably not use it, especially after seeing it go through a sweeping cycle. I was very surprised how easily they took to it and immediately seemed to prefer it over their regular litter boxes. My only real criticism of the box is that it instructs you to use very little litter and it often times is not enough for the cat to cover and the rake leaves what little there is at the end of the box. I do think it will be a real help when we have to leave the cats unattended for a log period of time. The motor operates very quietly and it was easy to assemble.  I have two cats and since you are supposed to have 1 more litter box than cats I can see where having to buy 3 of these would get pretty expensive. However, price aside, I would recommend this for anyone wanting to cut back on a nasty job.
 1 month follow-up:
  This is a neat concept but there are such wide spaces on the rake that it leaves a lot of little pieces behind and the maximum recommended level of cat litter is hardly enough for the cat to cover it up. I also think the 15 minute delay is not long enough for it to dry up and become scoopable. After using it for nearly a month I withdraw my recommendation. The con's outweigh the pro's.",3.0,0

"I absolutely love this product. It is sturdy, easy to put together, easy to use, does the job perfectly and  has saved so much time for the family (instead of standing there spraying tons of water everywhere). My 5 fur-babies (4 small and 1 ""large"" , but lets not tell her that), make a mess in my front yard and since I am the one who cuts the grass and uses all the tools for yard maintenance, this has been a savior. Now to get down to brass tacks; the customer service is beyond wonderful. The company sent an e-mail inquiring if I received the product and informed me of a How-To Video. The video was great and made using the product super easy. Stacy, the founder of Tidy Turd, is such a pleasure to talk to (
or write to really). I inquired about additional bags because my ""large"" pup makes a 'large"" mess. She was responsive in a very fast time, super friendly and understanding. She informed me that bags would be available for purchase coming up soon and to join the VIP club for special offers (which I did as soon as I received the first e-mail) and that she would be sending me some baggies to hold me over until available for purchase. I have no affiliation to this company or anyone who works/worked/etc with this company, however, I do believe that when there is a product that is a great price, works how it is suppose to AND has AMAZING customer service, a detailed review is warranted.

When Ryan Gosling arrives, he is haunted by a ghostly figure who appears to be a great-grandson of his father.

That was not true with our little old dog.  She tore into this new kibble with a vengeance.  After carefully considering the matter I believe its a tad softer and based on oder may be tastier.  In any case, she loves it.

"In her directorial debut, 27-year-old writer/director Gia Coppola recalls her niece, Sofia, more than her grandfather, Francis Ford.  The film, Palo Alto, based on short stories by co-star James Franco, is an anxious daydream of a film chronicling the coming of age of a few troubled teenagers in the titular Northern California city.  Among them is the smart, yet shy April (Emma Roberts), who engages in inappropriate flirtation with her older soccer coach, played by Franco.  The film is not defined by a sense of propulsion, but rather its sincerity, its concern for its characters' ethical conundrums, and a general air of authentic melancholy.  Everyone delivers a capable performance without overshadowing the other members of the ensemble; after years in the spotlight, this is far and away Roberts' most engaging and relaxed turn.  There are a few questionable storytelling and stylistic decisionsa disturbing house-party gang rape is related as an afterthought via almost wistful voice-overand the film is never as beautiful, moving, or sensual as the masterful The Virgin Suicides (a hard comparison to avoid), but the latest-to-the-game Coppola otherwise acquits herself nicely, confidently drawing the audience into the private lives and longings of the adolescent characters.",4.0,0

"Just excellent! This socket removed a water heater element from a 20+ year old water heater with zero maintenance. I broke a home depot water heater element extraction tool, and with this one and a 24"" breaker bar, the element came out with no problems at all. With that I discovered that my water heater is a decade past replacement but that's another story. I wasn't really sure of what I was going to receive so I'm going to try to explain it a little more for future purchasers. This is a normal profesional grade socket which I really couldn't imagine anyone breaking. It matches with a 1/2"" drive wrench. What differences it is that blue piece in the image. That's a blue plastic insert which rotates freely, and whose job is to fit around the water heater element and hold it in place. This makes it alot easier to install and remove since you don't have to hold the water heater element and socket together while trying to remove it. It was an A+ idea and really makes your life easier. It also makes it easier to install the element straight and not mess up the threads.

The other thing that made me think about purchasing or not this item is that in the image, the socket seems very shallow. Let me just say that's only how it looks at first. This socket is deep enough to fully grasp just about any water heater element.

Well that's it. I couldn't really recommend it more. Theres just nothing wrong with it, and it works perfectly. Much better than the other options on ebay, and for 15$ it may not be worth it in materials but it is definitely worth it in usefulness.",5.0,0

"I first saw this version of ""Ah! My Goddess"" online via another legal video streaming service and I fell in love with it.  I'm a huge fan of the OVA and this was done by the same director/producer Hiraoki Goda.

This anime is excellent for those who are either new to Anime or for those who like Fantasy and ""Slice of life"" anime. It's characters all have great stories and the overall story arc reaches a nice climax at the last show of the first season, and finishes in the first episode(s) of the 2nd season.
Great good guys, some moronic fall-back characters, wonderful bad guys (not very dangerous overall) and great mix of romance and missed opportunities by both of the protagonists.",5.0,0

"If you've watched director David DeCoteau's previous movies (The Brotherhood series, The Frightening, Leeches), then you pretty much know what to expect:

1) buff young studs running around in their underwear for no apparent reason

3) plots with holes the size of the Grand Canyon;

4) lots of bad acting;

5) awful music of any genre.

SPEED DEMON is no exception, although this is one of his less entertaining films.  The others at least had some modicum of suspense and/or horror.  This movie has no suspense, no horror, no real gore, no sex scenes (unless you count the numerous times the boys spread some kind of blood all over their buff chests.

The plot is absolutely gorgeous in its simplicity: a bunch of innocent people, plus a cop, are on a bus. A terrorist has put a bomb on the bus, so if the bus slows down everyone blows up and dies. And the bus happens to be on an ordinary, crowded big city highway. So once you realize ( very early on in the movie ) that the bus is definitely *not* going to blow up, you can enjoy the ride. So once we're handed the simple, bare-bones scenario, we get to see every single complication that can occur with one speeding bus, scared people, and public roads. Every single possibility of loss of life and horrible danger is explored in loving detail. That is where this movie gets really fun: just sit back and enjoy the ride.

"Death of Klinghoffer may or may not be a good opera.  It may or may not inappropriately glorify the Palestinian cause.  But, from this production, we'll never know.
First, it is a film based on the opera, NOT a film of the opera.  Something like one-half of the running time is devoted to videos of imagined (on the part of the director) action while the opera score serves as mere soundtrack.  What this might have looked like on the stage is entirely lost.  Alice Goodman is a subtle poet -- I doubt that she intended her libretto to be illustrated by such ham-handed visuals as this film employs.
Second, and much worse, is the awful background noise that overlays much of the music.  We hear shouting, gunfire, rocks hitting walls, and so on, during much of the time the chorus is singing, and even sometimes when the principals are singing.  On occasion this background noise drowns out the opera itself.  It is absolutely infuriating -- one wants to hear John Adams' music, not Ms. Eurotrash's background chatter.  It looks like the director simply uses this score as throwaway background music for a political film.
This is one of the few opera DVDs that I would not recommend that anyone acquire.  And it's really too bad -- we need more DVD recordings of good modern operas such as those of Adams.",1.0,0

"I have an orange tabby who has vomited after her breakfast almost every morning for the past ten years. The numerous veterinarians who have examined her agreed that she eats so quickly she might as well being inhaling her food, causing her to regurgitate quickly after she finished. It didn't matter if it was canned or dry food we fed, or how expensive or what ""formula"" she was given. This habit keeps her from gaining excess weight, but she would be, naturally, incredible unhappy and very vocal about losing her first meal of the day. We felt like we had tried everything to make things better for her - until we purchased this cute ball or ""globe"" as we like to call it.

The ""globe"" is very durable, easy to put food into, and the holes are adjustable so almost any dry food your cat eats will work with this ball. The concept is very simple and I can hardly believe it took so long to find this on the market. Our cat quickly learned to use her nose to nudge the globe around and is rewarded with a few pieces of food which she quickly eats, and then she starts nudging again. It takes her about 7-8 minutes to get all the food out of the ball and now she never vomits after she finishes her meal. This also helps her to get in a little play time as she loves to swat it around when it is empty.

"There is only one pro and con to this harness that matters.

HUGE PRO:  My 100+ pound dog is forced to turn around or stop every time he pulls on the leash because it is connected to the front of the harness.  This means less strain for me and my limbs every time we take a walk.  Previously, I used neck collars and harnesses where the leash ring was on my dog's back.  Neither prevented my dog from pulling and the former felt like I was choking him.  I think the latter made him feel like he was in control of the walk and not me.

CON: The harness has to be tightened in the appropriate areas (FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS ATTACHED TO THE HARNESS) or the HUGE PRO mentioned above is not great...effective, but not as effective.

Aside from that, I like the color of the harness and the contrast with the green and black.  Wish they made more harnesses with this color instead of the ugly lime green that seems so prevalent as an option.",4.0,0

"This movie was a pure waste of time - the story lacks originality as its basic premise of good fighting evil seems to be a rehash of other famous fantasy classics like LOTR. Director Uwe Boll who also gave us movies like BloodRayne seems bent on insulting viewer's sensibilities by producing fantasy movies that lack originality.

The basic premise here - Jason Statham (The Transporter) plays Farmer, a simple laborer who gets embroiled in an epic battle of good versus evil when Duke Fallow (Matthew Lillard) conspires with a magician named Gallian (Ray Liotta) to overthrow King Konreid (Burt Reynolds). There are other familiar names in the cast -Leelee Sobieski, John Rhys-Davies, Ron Perlman, Claire Forlani, Kristanna Loken, Brian J. White , all of whom add little to pique one's interest in the movie.

The acting on the whole is pretty average, and the Krugs look like they are a poor imitation of the Orcs from LOTR. All in all, this comes across as a cheap, uninspired knock-off of other fantasy classics and is not worth wasting one's money on. I would recommend passing on this one.",2.0,0

"I recently have been training hard (almost overtraining) and had to head into a few weeks of active recovery (still wanted a workout, but couldn't do anything hard on the knees). I bought this DVD in a store for [. ], and can't believe how good it is. I was having serious pain in my right knee, and, after doing this workout a few times, have no more knee pain. My muscles feel lengthened and have recovered quite nicely, and I have greatly improved my flexibility. I love this workout so much I am going to add it in once a week when I start strength training/plyometrics training again. This workout is no joke, however; it was exactly what I was looking for--low impact, but still making me sweat and mentally begging Bob to say we were done holding a pose. He combines some pilates in with standard yoga, which I liked, and still pushes you to your limits. He does tend to make you hold plank a lot, but that was fine for me having to let my lower rather than my upper body recover. He wasn't annoying like some yoga instructors can be--he was encouraging yet demanding at the same time. Some reviewers have made comments about the music, but you shouldn't even notice the music if you are focusing on the moves like you should be. I LOVE the ability to customize your workout as well--great for those who have to work out but have limited amounts of time. Overall, this was a great yoga workout. Having done yoga before as a part of the P90X program, it is a solid workout--and not 90 minutes long like the P90X yoga DVD was. I would highly recommend this workout to anyone wanting to improve their flexibility and strength, or anyone who needs some recovery like myself!

"Understanding that all wax seals will eventually fail, I researched the alternatives and purchased this Danco seal and a Fluidmaster rubber seal - in case one didn't work properly. The toilet it was to be used with is about a year old and is from the American Standard ""Mainstream"" family.

The floor is tiled and level. The toilet flange is the newest PVC flange that Oatey makes, is ""above the floor"", and level.

The specs on this Danco seal state that it will work with flanges that are ""above the floor"", up to 1/2"" tall.

This seal didn't compress enough to allow the toilet to sit flush with the floor. It just rocked side to side. There was no error with the installation as the toilet was repositioned several times to ensure that a proper ""set down"" onto the Seal was made. There just simply wasn't enough room between the outlet on the bottom of the toilet and the top of the flange for this Seal to fit into.

You know what worked? The cheapie old Harvey wax ring. Prepped and placed the toilet down the first time and flush the toilet sits.

Maybe this Danco Seal works for some combinations of toilets and flange heights - but if you want to save yourself some grief, purchase and have on hand the good ole' wax ring just in case you're in the predicament I was in.

"Purchased this light for my high-tech planted tank before really doing much research. After using the light for a few weeks I've come to realize that it's not enough light for ""high-light"" plants. This model only puts out 20W which means that for a 20g tank you're still only getting 1W/gallon. CurrentUSA also claims a PAR reading of 100 in the center from 12"" above. Every single third-party test I've seen and read refutes this claim. The most I've seen from independent tests is about 65-70 PAR in ideal conditions. Not bad, but definitely not an honest description by CurrentUSA.

One other thing I really dislike about this light is the controller (the brains of the hardware). I really wish they would have integrated the controller into the housing unit of the light because it seems to always fall off my table and whenever I pick it up the buttons are so sensitive that one slight touch the lights will come on full blast in the middle of the night and startle my fish. The 24/7 feature is kind of nice and so is the dawn/dusk feature. I could have done without the gimmicky settings such as cloudy and lightning storm.

At the end of the day I ended up buying two units in order to get the PAR values that I needed for my tank. If you decide to do something similar just keep in mind that you cannot pair two units with one controller however you can use the same remote to control the two separate controllers. Overall  if you are looking for a low to mid light for around $100 (not sure why anyone would) then you may want to consider this light.",3.0,0

It works great, but it is very thin and doesn't seem to have the power to hold up to the elements.  I had to replace it with a CFL light bulb because it was too big to fit into the fixture.

"Once Around is one of the most entertaining movies I've seen in a long time. It has a lot of heart and is definitely a must see for the whole family.

"Remember when Coca-Cola stupidly decided to mess with its formula and gave us ""New Coke,"" the soda no one in America had asked for? Well, the decision by Royal Canin to reformulate Indoor Light 40 gives me feelings of deja vu--why couldn't they just leave well enough alone? Whether that decision was driven by corporate bean counters looking to cut costs--as some here have suggested--I can't say. But the results, at least for my cat, have not been good.

My cat will eat ONLY dry food and, until a few weeks ago, the only brand I've ever fed him is Royal Canin, as recommended by his breeder. As time passed and he put on some weight, I moved to the Indoor Light 40 formula, which was fine... until Royal Canin decided to mess with the formula. His allergic reactions started almost immediately, though it took some consulting with my vet--and reading about similar experiences posted here--before I realized that the changed formula of his food was the cause.

I have now switched to Orijen dry cat food, which has vastly superior, high-protein meats and fish, and only 17% carbohydrates. He loves it, the allergy issues are gone and I feel better feeding him dry food that isn't laden with carbs. When it comes to cats, I can't say if my experience will be your experience. However, there seems to be no benefit to the reformulation of Indoor Light, but it has caused problems for many cat owners, including myself.

Thanks for taking the time to read my review, and I hope you find it helpful in making a buying decision.",2.0,0

"Ordinary action flicks suffer from the affliction of predictability.  We all know that the gun wielding tough guy will systematically destroy all of his enemies and heroically beat the boss after a more difficult battle at the end.  If you are tired of these kinds of movies, then watch Lucky Number Slevin instead.

What transpires in this movie is completely unpredictable, and it never ceases to be entertaining.  Part of the fun that you have when watching this movie is following the constantly changing and twisting plot.  So I'm not going to ruin any of your viewing pleasure by giving it away.  But I will say it involves the relationship between mob bosses, the stakes of risky gambling, assasins, thugs, and innocent people being caught in the crossfire.  As you can see, it has all of the staples of an action flick.

Superb character development and visual effects make this a must-see action movie with a great plot twist.",4.0,0

"Critics are generally not very nice to movies like this one.  I guess THEY didn't grow up watching this kind of stuff and don't  have those fond memories (which explains the 4 stars).  The night me and my family got cable tv in the early 80s (first ones in the neighborhood) this hilarious flick was on.  Nudity on the boob tube was still something new to us.  So Zapped! was just about the coolest naughty movie I'd ever seen.  Watching it now is still a delight!  Just silly non-sense...but awfully fun!  The young lady from The Facts of Life tv show is great (and looks like my niece).  Baio may be a little TOO nerdy, but he and Aames are believable friends.  Plus, anything with Scatman Crothers (The Shining, One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest, Twilight Zone: The Movie) is worth seeing.  This could be the 1982 equivalent of movies like American Pie.  Just leave your brain at the door, pop this in the machine and you'll find much to enjoy on a lazy saturday afternoon.  Try a triple feature with Sixteen Candles and Just One of The Guys (or Weird Science and The Breakfast Club).

"I was looking forward to this dvd. However, was disappointed:

- The presentation could have been better.  The background & lighting is drab with a crinkly velvet curtain that distracts the eyes from following her movement. And in parts she seems too absorbed in following her movements in the mirror in front of her rather than demonstrating a movement to the viewer.
- The filming has been done from behind and the sideway. So you don't really get to see a good full view of each movement. And unless you zoom in the dvd player, you can not clearly see a front view of the movements in the mirror in front of which she demonstrates the moves.
- The moves are demonstrated in isolation and there is not enough explanations for each movement as if she is careful not to give too much away.  No combination of movements demonstrated.

The performance part is ok, but not as good & natural as she usually is.  The dvd is mostly for beginner's level and doesn't have much originality.  Apart from her choosing good descriptive names for a few of the moves, on the whole this dvd lacks substance as an instructional one.",2.0,0

Admittedly, it won't be cheap. Current exchange rate amounts to eighteen bucks plus shipping. But you'll then be able to enjoy one of the classics of science fiction. It predates WarGames by more than ten years, and offers a more realistic--if darker--vision of the future of computer intelligence.

I've read the critical comments by other reviewers here and I see it differently. Great performance, great A/V. Is it like a studio recording? Of course not! Rush has processes they use when writing that can give a certain snap-shot view of a song that very well might have progressed by the time it gets to your local venue. During the Time Machine tour, you could hear it by listening to Caravan from the studio with what it had become by the time they reached Denver. It was alive! You simply have to see Rush live - and often. People have been reported to behave inappropriately if deprived of their Rush fix. Get this and laugh a little, smile a lot. It's an awesome set.",5.0,0

There were some pretty funny parts and I did laugh throughout but this is really only a one time watch at most.

The DVD is also a must have for the collection, as it is a great addition to any collection.

If you're a Gibson fan, this movie is worth the price of admission.A very good movie. I love the fact that it is a comedy. I will watch it again.Good movie.  But not great.  I think the acting is better than it should be.  You have to have a really good story line to enjoy it.  There is a scene where a woman is trying to get a divorce from her ex-husband.  The reason I like this movie is because it has a lot of action and action scenes.  I will watch it again.  I have to give it a 5 out of 5.  You can't go wrong with this one.

"Bought this since I needed a worklight that could run off batteries.  The unit is quite large and reasonably well built.  It gives off good enough light - not particularly very bright but bright enough to illuminate dim areas where ambient light will be available.  One thing to keep in mind that LEDs that are too bright can be a hindrance since they can be blinding reflecting off surfaces inches away where you're likely to use this thing.  Therefore this wouldn't be a great ""lantern"" in the event of a power outage, but instead provides balanced light in tight spots.  It does bend as well so can direct light optimally as you need it.  With the price in mind it's an excellent value worth every penny.",5.0,0
"This is a mediocre yet tolerable romantic comedy. It tries to be like Romancing the Stone but it falls short. The acting isn't too great, the characters cheesy and the plot silly but it's watchable.

I'd never heard of this film in all these years and though it was decent to watch I can see why it never made a big impact.

For a romance it was disappointing. The characters are thrown together and fall in love in a day. I guess it's supposed to be spontaneous but it just seemed ridiculous to me. The so-called villains act like they jumped out of a Pink Panther cartoon.

This was definitely a mixed bag for me. It starts off intriguing but becomes less and less interesting as it goes on.

I wouldn't have kept watching it if Tim Daly hadn't looked so hot in it. He looks good with a mustache!

I wasn't too impressed by how the film looked. It hasn't held up well at all in 20 years. This was made in 1992 but the quality of the movie makes it seem like it was made in '72.",2.0,0
"Bwa ha ha -- the master of the midnight movie is back, after far too long an absence from the scene, with what one might actually accept as the ultimate ""grrl power"" flick.

But acceptance is not Henenlotter's purpose here.  His aim as usual is to entertain, shock, and amuse, and he attains his goals on his accustomed shoe-string budget.

Indeed, part of the fun of this DVD is listening to the commentary, in which the outre auteur and his young white-boy-rapper producer describe the guerilla movie-making techniques they employed to realize this bizarre sexual fantasy.  The fact that they accidentally set fire to the 150-year-old mansion they rented for a whopping $4,000 as the film's primary location -- and then extinguished the flame with diet soda -- gives you some clue that this was not a normal shoot!

And then there are the purple-hued ""penis-cam"" shots...

Suffice it to say that if you enjoy ""Something Weird"" videos, you will likely enjoy this film, which also features one of the most tragic ""happy endings"" you will ever see.

As the director says on the commentary, at the consummation of this unusual love story, ""Now there's something you don't see every day.""  That's what makes this film -- and Henenlotter himself -- so special...",5.0,0

"No General ever won a war by dying for his country, he won it by making his enemies die and then coming home to die a few months later in a car crash. Sadly that was the fate of the real general Patton. The movie is a first rate film about one of America's most controversial Generals. I can't say I liked everything Patton did, but he was living in a world wide inferno of a hell on earth so I think he did better than most would have in his position. Francis Ford Coppola wrote the screenplay for Patton and I was deeply impressed by the style. It captured the general's character extremely well. The acting of George C. Scott was above reproach. The blu-ray edition was high definition awesomeness. All in all it was a terrific film and a worthy addition to any avid film buffs collection, ""ahem"".",5.0,0

The f-word happens in real life of course, I use it on occasion, but this was forced into the majority of dialogue just to be...to be what? Edgy? Hip? With it? If so, it didn't work.

"ALERT! SOME REVEALS HERE!

Anyone coming to this film w/o having seen the previous movies in the franchise has no grounds for complaint. However, as a film in the series, it is still flawed on a number of narrative levels. I have not read the books -- I'm waiting for the series to come out on Kindle -- and so I can only speak to the stories as they have been presented in the movies. This is legitimate, as the movies *ought* to be a stand-alone narrative.

Fundamental story matters are introduced without explanation (the mirror fragment) or eliminated without blinking (only *6* horcruxes are ever named and ultimately destroyed, even though it was explicitly stated that there were seven. Also, recall that Harry is the ""unnamed eighth"" horcrux that even Voldemort did not know about, and thus cannot be counted on this list.)

I've a fair eye for such details, so when major details like these suddenly get added and/or subtracted w/o explanation, it creates a radical disruption in the movie for me. As a consequence, on first viewing this film was almost unintelligible to me. That takes some doing, and it is a doing that typically is not worth the effort.

That said, having seen part II in the theatre, returning to part I (which I've now viewed a couple more times) the entire story line makes more sense, and the gaps and flaws of part I are much less distracting so that the OTHER details of the story-telling can now shine through.

Those other details really are very well done. But the flaws in the film make those finer moments difficult, if not impossible, to fully appreciate on the first viewing.",4.0,0

"INSTALLATION TIPS:
1. READ the Installation sheet! Even if you have installed other toilets. There really are tips that make it easier. Even so, it's still a hassle to install a toilet. Get real. And this one more so, because everything is concealed -- ""pay"" now, for years of easier cleaning, later.
2. Install the seat BEFORE you install the toilet. So if you want a different seat, have it on hand before the installation.

BONUS 1: It's almost like having a dual flush toilet. With just a quick push and release on the lever, there is enough water to flush liquid. For a thorough flush of solids, hold the lever down for the full flush. I find this traditional lever flush on the side of the tank easier to use than the push buttons on the top of some water-efficient toilets.

I am using it in the kitchen, in a shed, in a closet, in the hallway, in a bedside table, and in my back yard.  It is a great light, and it has a very low profile.  I've had it for about a year now and I am very happy with it.  I will update this review if I find any problems with it.

Update: I received a new one, which is a very good light, and it is exactly what I was looking for.  I have to say that I had some problems with the light, but I am very happy with the light.

"I saw The Suitor at the Sacramento French Film Festival this year, and bought the whole collection for the Sacramento Alliance Francaise.  Pierre Etaix has a deadpan comedy style much like Buster Keaton or Harold Lloyd.  Some of his film, like The Suitor, could easily have been silent films.  The set includes all of Etaix's films, including his last, a documentary about the French during summer vacations.  It was this film that so outraged the French that Etaix was never able to make another film in France.  He meant it as a comedy, but the French thought he was making fun of them.  One of the long films, The Great Love (Le Grand Amour) starred his wife at the time as his wife.  The film Yoyo takes place over decades, with Etaix playing both father and son depending upon the decade.  In the years before 1928, the film is silent.  The film becomes a talkie only when the action takes place after talkies were invented.",5.0,0

"My 21 month old, 50 pound lab mix needs something to chew on every day. He chews between 30 minutes to one hour daily. Most toys he can destroy in a day or less. This includes the giant ropes! The only chew toys that last are heavy duty Kong toys and these Nylabones. He prefers the nylabones and rarely goes for the Kong toys. I keep two or three different shape and textured nylabones out for him all the time and replace them every 9 to 12 months. That's about how long it takes him to chew it down to about two inches. This regular shaped bone and the wishbone are his favorites over the heavily textured type. I can't tell the difference by smell of the different flavors and he doesn't prefer one flavor over another either. I like these over real bones because he isn't able to chew off a sharp chunk and swallow it. These shred in small bits like sawdust and won't hurt your pet if swallowed.

"I have 6 cats and this is the most popular treat yet.  I have to be careful to be fair and divert the more agressive cats or they will fight over them.  My old cat is the one with the bad coat but it has been improving very well with these.  She also gets a joint supplement one.  Her coat is filling out nicely and she is looking a lot better, much less ragged.  These don't bother any of my cats, even my puke queen who throws up with every new thing.  I've had NO episodes of tummy upset with any of the cats.
They are little fish shaped treats, brown, and feel moist to the touch.  I would suggest having another bag of treats nearby that they can have extras of, because they want more than one. They are only supposed to eat one treat each a day, but my cats got in my desk drawer and drug the treat bags out.  This one was the one they wanted- they chewed a HOLE in it and got a few of the treats out.  They were all ok though.  They didn't get the whole bag, but just a few, I guess 5 or 6 maybe they managed to chew out of the bag, which is a heavy plasticy-foil bag with a zip top.  The top held well so they just tried to get in the bag.  IF the bag had been paper or a bag like party treats came in, I've no doubt they would have ate the whole bag.

"I have a soft spot for GOG because I saw it when I was very young with my parents at a Drive In (not first run, but in some late-1960s re-release).

This is, honestly, NOT some long forgotten great SF treasure. This is not War Of The Worlds, or Time Machine, or Day The Earth Stood Still, or The Thing, or Invasion Of The Body Snatchers-- great films all.

GOG is a second- or even third-rate SF B-picture. It's almost one step away from being a MST3K parody. ( I haven't checked, maybe MST3K actually did parody it).

There's a lot of talk and not much action. The characters are all cardboard. The scriptwriters force the actors to deliver looooooong monolog lectures, 'explaining' nonexistent pseudo-science to an audience they must have thought were imbeciles. The dialog is stilted and chunky and amateurish.

And the zero-budget 'special effects' are GOG and MAGOG, a couple of aluminum-foil-covered-cardboard-box chest-height ""robots"" that don't even move an inch for most of their brief time onscreen.

I mean, this is a painfully awful little film.

I would never spend money to own a copy. But if you're in a nostalgic (and very forgiving, and MST3K-ish) mood, by all means see this on Instant Prime Streaming.
Feel free to jeer and boo at times, and enjoy the cheesy no-budget unintended campiness that is GOG.

"The Turning Point isn't as lightweight as it appears. Shirley MacLaine's performance as the dancer-turned-mother and wifie, and Ann Bancroft's role as the aging ballerina who won't let go of the past is quite realistic. Each woman is struggling with an ego that won't allow them to voice their true emotions, all fear-based and poignant. One fears that she wasn't ever good enough to become the star her friend went on to be, and hides behind motherhood and a veiled jealousy of her daughter who is definitely on her way. The other is also jealous of the life her friend has, and fears growing old and being forgotten by the dance world she loves and hates. As Shirley MacLaine's character seeks answers through infidelity and anger, Ann Bancroft takes Shirley's daughter hostage, pets and spoils her - all to feed her own self-confidence.  Frankly, I think the cat fight on the roof is a wonderful scene, because finally, the two friends are able to show her fear and anger of being forgotten and growing old, and express their desire for something they can never have, for whatever reason, to each other. Watching Mikhail leap through the air is indeed a pleasure as well; but I personally enjoy his love scenes and Leslie Brown's long arms reaching to the sky as she falls in love with him.

"I have used this for fine cracks in my drive way for about 5 years.  Some cracks take multiple fillings to finally fill the crack.  It sticks to the concrete and holds it together keeping it from spreading out.  One of the really important functions is to seal the crack so that water can not get down to undermine the concrete or to fill the crack in the winter, freeze and spread the concrete apart.  It totally seals the crack.  Some cracks I have gone back the next year and applied a little more of the sealer to update the sealing of the crack.  It works wonderfully like nothing I have ever seen before and I have owned homes for 49 years.",5.0,0

If anything, the section on how the collapse of WTC1 and WTC2 was made more clear with the explanations supplied with the excerpted footage from Explosive Evidence than Explosive Evidence itself.

Where this documentary fell down was in the omission of Silverstein's PBS interview where he freely admitted that WTC7 was deliberately imploded, which was one of the few actual pieces of evidence given in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/9-11-The-Myth-and-The-Reality-2-DVD-Set/dp/B000VRF4C6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">9/11: The Myth and The Reality - 2 DVD Set</a>.  The other glaring issue was the allegation that pulmonary fibrosis and mesothelioma were running rampant in the wake of the destruction of WTC1 and WTC2.  Problem:  asbestos-induced interstitial fibrosis and mesothelioma have very clear latency times of 20 years after the date of first exposure.  If such an epidemic is to happen, it will not happen for another 45 months from the time this review is written.  Also, mesothelioma already occurs in 1/1,000,000 people each year WITHOUT prior asbestos exposure.  If these diagnoses in past cases are correct, there are some equally disturbing causes: either a) there was prior exposure well ahead of 9/11, or b) there are additional toxic materials not previously identified to the public used in the construction of WTC1 and WTC2.",4.0,0

"Why tinker with a masterpiece? This original movie version of the stage play was remade twice for the screen and once for television and all of them are not just poor remakes, they are AWEFUL in comparison. The 1950's musical remake, ""The Opposite Sex"" fails in many ways. First, by turning it into a musical. Second, by casting June Allison in the lead. And third, by adding men to the cast. The latest remake from a few years ago fails by trying to modernize the storyline. The story works best when set in the 1930's pre-""women's lib"". This 1939 version is much more biting and satiracal, the actresses give their all for director George Cukor. As superb as Joan Crawford, Norma Shearer and Rosiland Russell are, for me, the stand-out performances were by the three older actresses, Mary Boland, Marjorie Main, and especially Lucile Watson.",5.0,0

"Most Anime's that come out have clean, well-defined lines as well as neat sharp colors.  This is the common style not only for mass consumption but for ease of the work load by standardization.  While Casshern of course has its roots burried deep in all that makes Anime look like Anime, it's one of very few that have ventured beyond for a more artistic delivery.  At times there are some very sketchy lines, contorted facial features, rapid action that instead of a subdued unmoving backgrounds, every part of many frames are animated to keep the eyes fairly treated.  Casshern is a great story, one that in the first half is nearly perfect, if only the second half could have carried it as gracefully.  Still, the second half isn't one to scoff at, as it's still great and brings with it the finality of the characters that over the course of the show you come to enjoy, even Ringo.  What makes this show great is that it isn't teathered to its source material, and instead of being a tribute, it's a reboot.  This isn't only one of the better animated shows ever produced, but a great story as well.  One that isn't necessarily just for fans of Anime, but people that can appreciate the medium.  I highly recommend the blu ray in particular as this was a modern produced anime, so the clarity and color were practically made with the format in mind.",4.0,0

"Whoever designed this simple, yet CRITICAL piece of gear should be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.  I love my cattle dog mix, even though she is an on-the-go-pooper.  One every walk.  Usually within the first 5 minutes of a 30-45 minute walk.  Being a responsible dog owner, I carry the bags and then had to use that knot/leash hold maneuver to carry her deposit to a proper repository.  Two months ago, we adopted a second cattle dog mix and now I have a leash in each hand while I walk the poopingest dogs in the world.  Bag juggle??? Not so much.

So I searched for a solution and I found this simple, yet AMAZING solution.  It's durable and can't imagine it will take years for the rubber to stretch out and give way.  I have one for each leash making it much safer to walk them because I've got positive control of the leashes.  I sent one to my aunt and one to my mom for their dogs.  I suggested my dog walker to charge each client a one time fee to get one for each of her walking clients.

The dog accessory industry is so vast, yet this is one of the must underrated necessities.  I have NEVER found anything like this in stores.  I'm glad someone thought of making them.  Bravo Alcott.... Bravo.",5.0,0

"My doc has been after me to use Hibiclens for a chronic skin problem I've been suffering with.. Problem was I couldn't afford it.  So being a rather resourceful person, I figured it out.  If a Vet. grade product that is used on animals is safe, and it is the same basic chemical as Hibiclens (without all the dyes and perfumes) then what the heck do I have to worry about?  So I tried it, and it worked. But the real test came when I went back to my doc and told her that although I could not afford Hibiclens, I got a Vet. Grade product of chlorhexidine and used it.  Her response? She smiled and gave me a thumbs up!  In other words folks, if this stuff is safe for Fluffy it's safe for you too.  That is, as safe as any chemical might be.  Use your head, read, dilute the stuff (one ounce per gallon). Don't get it in your ears and eyes and please first mention it to your doc that you intend on doing this. They are the professionals, and if it's not good for you they will say so.  Always check with your doc. And I don't mean Dr. Google.",5.0,0

"First of all, it's NOT HORROR (JUST HORRIBLE)

Three completely bland, removed, uninspiring, predictable shorts that are too long and really give no real insite into the state of the ""American Family"". There's nothing thought provoking here, these shorts make an attempt to shock it's audience with violence that ends up doing nothing to add to or help drive any real message home. That's the peoblem with all three films from the very beginning you know what the message is (none being at all enlightening) and then are forced to watch a long drawn out story with no twists, no insight, and does absolutely nothing to relate to the viewer or to draw you in, 2 of which are ended with a scene of violence that utimately means nothing. The scenes are meant to shock but end up being just another scene that just happens to have blood in it. Theres no emotion, no character developement, it's bland and dull- uneffective.

Bottom line- 1.if you want something thought provoking this is not it. 2.if you're looking for gore and blood look somewhere else this just won't satisfy 3.if you're looking to be dissapointed look no further, this ones for you 4.

Only at night would they eat a TINY tad, only enough to basically sustain life out of starvation. One of the puppies started looking thinner and mind you, these ""puppies"" are already between 60-65 pounds each so I know they had be hungry. I started doing my own research on the food to try to see if others were experiencing this behavior with their dogs also. While I hadn't been buying this food on Amazon, I was buying it at our local pet food store, I still feel compelled to let everyone know that consumer affairs has a lot of complaints about this food, with the same exact symptoms as a lot of people on Amazon have and the same as we had with our two puppies, refusing to eat and loose stools. I returned the last bag I had purchased from the pet food store today and replaced their food with ""Zignature"" limited ingredient dog food and let me tell you, these dogs tore it up!! As soon as I sat their bowls down they started gobbling their food up. No I am not an employee of Zignature or paid by the company, this is just my honest review.

"After reading many pet water fountain reviews, I bought this fountain as a solution to my cats constantly drinking out of the toilet.  I have water that I change in 2 large ceramic dog bowls twice a day in different locations, one by their kibble dish and one upstairs.  They still use all the options but drink out of the fountain enough so that I have to add between a pint and a quart of water each day.

I have 2 long-haired cats and 2 short-haired, all under a year old.  The fountain has not clogged from all the hair!  It's great that it has a filter.  I clean it  every week or 2 by hand.  It's simple to clean, no need to use a dishwasher.  I place the top part on the floor and take the bottom part to the kitchen to wash, and vice versa.  The cats have to check out the empty fountain and watch while I refill it.

It was easy to set up.  Once I figured out that the hose from the pump needs to go into the opening in the top part of the fountain, there was nice water movement.

I didn't find a specific mat to go under it, but I have it in a place where there is tile so it doesn't matter if water splashes out.  If anyone knows what mat works best with this, please add that to your review.

I have it in the living room and I think location is important.  There's a lot of activity in that room and they prefer being where the action is.  And now part of the action is drinking water from the fountain.  It's on the floor near a scratching post and near the cat door.

It's a very quiet fountain.  You can hear the pump slightly, but it's a relaxing sound.  I don't unplug it at night.  It runs 24/7.",5.0,0

"A brutal film that shows the treatment of females in the Muslim world, the USA with thousands of refugees that has received and now more thousands coming do not have any laws to protect girls from female circumcision, forced marriage and Honor killing.
Spain checks any child taken to their Muslims countries for a visit and if they come back mutilated, both parents serve jail time and after are deported without any female child.
Muslims give more value to a camel than a female.
The USA needs to pass laws to protect women, and stop the use of Sharia Law in the USA by Muslim lawyers for family issues because are on favor of men and some States are allowing..

"Bidets are awesome so this review is not a statement of the usefulness of a bidet.  Those of us who have visited Japan come back with an attitude of ""what have I been thinking trying to clean myself with a dry tissue?""  When you find a good bidet you'll never want to use anything else.

I took off one star for each of the three problems I found with this product:

Problem #1:  The product fit the mounting holes fine, as the pre-measurement assured it would.  The problem was the how the seat closed.  The back of our existing toilet seat interfered slightly with the top of the bidet.  This bent the nozzle back out of vertical position, causing the water stream out between users legs and onto the floor.  There was no mention in product description of pre-measuring the seat for this issue.

Problem #2:  There is no pressure adjustment.  Our house is new construction so the water pressure is great, about 75 psi.  Ouch.  Yes I can open the valve slightly to compensate but the valve is sensitive so there were many ouch moments.

Problem #3:  As you see from many other comments, the bidet causes a big gap in the front of the toilet seat.  Options are to ignore this (I think most positive reviewers are doing this), buy shims to fill the gap, or....buy a different product.  I built a nice house and it looks quite unprofessional to have a toilet seat with a 2-3"" gap in the front.  The gap on our toilet seat was greater than other reviewers due to problem #1 (see pic).",2.0,0

"I recently purchased the ""ultra"" model on Amazon along with the forever litter tray and crystals.  I haven't used the Forever litter tray yet (the Scoopfree Ultra came with one tray/crystals so I'm using that first.)  The scoopfree ultra machine seems very sturdy and I'm very satisfied with my purchase so far.  I really like the counter that keeps track of how many times the machine is used, at first I thought it was an unnecessary feature, but it really helps to know the cats are actually using it and when to replace the cartridge.  I have two cats and at first they saw the machine and were scared of it.  I mixed in some of their old litter and took away the old litter box completely and I'm happy to report they are both using it!  I'm keeping the hood off for now, I'm concerned that they feel too intimidated if they are enclosed inside the box, I will put it back on in the future when they are more comfortable with the new machine.  When my item was delivered, it was not sent in a shipping box with padding, only in the manufacture's box with a label slapped on.  Needless to say the box was beaten and looked taped together when it arrived.  In hindsight, I probably would recommend buying the box at a local pet store instead of online, luckily I've never had to return anything to amazon, but it seems like it would be a big hassle if the unit arrived broken or the cats decided not to use it.

"As a recent new cat person, I purchased this for my cat to have a place to scratch, perch, and play. My cat was immediately interested in this condo, even as I was putting it together. Assembly wasn't too hard, I just followed what another reviewer had suggested and used a picture for reference. It should be noted that this unit is kind of HUGE. It is very tall! While the size works just fine for where I have it located, make sure to check the dimensions of your space before purchasing.

A few months after adopting my first cat, I adopted a second one. Both cats, each around 8 pounds, love to jump from the different perches. Though all the screws are tightened (something I check monthly as they tend to loosen over time), the whole thing does shake when they are running around on it. This does not seem to bother the cats, and therefore does not bother me. This unit has lived on hardwood floors and carpeting, neither flooring seems to aid or reduce in the amount of shaking. My cats do not spend much time in either cubby space, they mostly make use of the perches. While I love the blue color of this unit, it does highlight the amount of cat hair left behind. I vacuum the condo about once every 1-2 weeks.

I have had this unit for about 9 months and it has suffered a bit of damage. The highest perch is the most popular, and thus has suffered some minor shredding/tearing of the blue carpeting. The top hanging mouse has not survived, but the lower one is still hanging on. Finally, the base of the unit suffered some damage from my robot vacuum. I now block off the condo so that he cannot climb up it anymore (obviously not the cat trees fault).

Overall I think this is a great cat condo, and every time I see my cats playing on it, I feel happy.",5.0,0

"One cannot ask for a better product than this exercise pen.  Although I did not purchase this playpen for a puppy, it served its purpose exceptionally well for a mother cat and her five newborn kittens.  The purpose was to keep them isolated from my other cats while they were being cared for by momma and so that they could not wonder off and become lost prior to their eyes opening.

This playpen is built strong and durable, with two zippered opening on the side.  The netting on each opening can be rolled up and vecroed into place.  The entire top can be zippered off and on, providing easy access to reach your puppy or kittens/cats.  Two sturdy pouches on the side is available for grooming products and accessories.  There is also two net pockets.

One of the nicest attributes of this playpen is;  it can be folded and broken down quickly and stored in the storage pouch that comes with it.  Portable and easily moved by two people, even when erected.  Durable enough to be placed outside to allow your pets to get that fresh air environment.

I highly recommend this product if you're looking for something to assist in isolating your pets during their younger days.  For the price, you will not be disappointed.",5.0,0

"I ordered the season and watched every episode back to back as soon as it became available. Epic! This season parts company from the books because there are no more novels at present, so purists will find a lot to dislike about this season. On the other hand, it is great TV with some fantastic acting by all of the male leads. Kit Harrington, Liam Cunningham and Stephen Dillane are powerful all the way through, and Tyrion and Sir Jorah are a delight as always. Great work from Jonathan Pryce as the High Sparrow.
As for the women, Arya and Brienne continue to surprise and delight, and Sansa gets a bit less like a wet noodle.  Circe is up to her usual tricks but as Bronn says, evil has a tendency to turn back on itself. Margery and her gran, the amazing Diana Rigg, rounded things out pretty nicely. Not much movement from Queen Dany but we are left with all sorts of interesting possibilities in the final episode.
There are a lot of unanswered questions at the end of Episode 10 and throughout the whole season with respect to Bran, and for the past 2 seasons with regard to Rickon and the wilding woman who was supposed to find somewhere safe for him. Episode 8 shows there is nowhere safe from the Whitewalkers.  Great special effects and settings round off an excellent season, not perfect, but certainly better than most things on TV these days.

here's a slice of advice; rent a good horror film like freddy vs jason or underworld. pass on the indie horror flicks, especially anything from lion's gate who released crap like; house of 1000 corpses,May and this trash cabin fever. although ginger snaps was pretty good. and get this..lions gate has accquired ARTISAN, the guys that realeased the god awful HOUSE OF THE DEAD..oh boy.",1.0,0

"It dims, it controls a fan with more than 3 positions, it has a remote control, what more could you want?!

Oh yes, CFL/LED control. I'm surprised they haven't brought those features over to this model yet, the main issue being that the CFL/LED dimmer models allow give more range on the lower-end of the scale, where those lamps usually tend to need it to give a smooth dimming range.

"This collection gives us The Old Maid, seldom seen before VHS and this DVD. This film conyains one of Miss Davis' greatest performances, as she enters into the very heart of what a loveless life can do, to a young woman, and finnaly an older woman, living in a house with a cousin who caused so much of her loneliness.

Deception has Miss Davis squaring off with Claude Rains in a series of scenes very suspenseful and very dark in mood and setting. It is not to be missed.

The others are great: Watch on the Rhine is spectacular, with an ending that truly shocks and moves one.

All This and Heaven Too, is Boyer's best., as Miss Davis draws him out of his ""Take me to the Cassbah"" routine. Her performance is subtle, compressed, as the character she portrays undergoes a harrowing series of rejections.

The Great Lie has Bette Davis face off with Mary Astor, both in top form, battleing for the same lover, a very strange George Brent. Catch Hattie MacDaniel as the ever perceptive maid, and the explosive western retreat scene, between Mary Astor and Bette Davis, as they encounter each other in the midst of dust storms, no lights, and no creature comforts of any kind!

In this Our Life directs us to the racism so prevalent in Hollywood and everywhere else. Bette Davis hits the marks with a portrayal of blistering madness, off set by Olicvia DeHavilland's cool, moody reactions. The racisl issue is very daring, and the ending will surprise you!

Get this set and let Bette Davis show what great acting is.",5.0,0

He always goes with me and even though the ADA does not require a service dog to have a vest, I have him wearing one because it makes it easier for us to go out in public. I have several different vests, but I was looking for a non-tradional and lightweight one. This one is great. I love the gray pattern and it is super lightweight. I also like how it is not only breathable, but it really lightweight. This had some padding, but it was easy to sew patches on it. It is anti-tug and very easy for my dog to wear. It fit him nicely, but could be a little tighter. It could be a little bit tighter, but it will not adjust any tighter. This is a nice harness and came with a series of patches. I can either wear these patches or I can remove them and add saddle bags. The handle isn't really good for mobility, but it is overall, a really sharp looking vest.

"There are many hoof supplements and they tend to have very similar ingredients, but do vary.  This means that depending on exactly why your horse doesnt have top quality hooves, different supplements may work better for your particular horse.  Or, of course, if your horses hooves are of poor quality for a reason not related to nutrition, supplements may do nothing at all.

B vitamins, particularly biotin folic acid and Bs are important for the hoof.  According to the guaranteed analysis, this supplement only has biotin.  It does offer a high level of this, at 25 mg per serving.

Zinc and copper are the mineral supplements most likely to help hooves and this supplement offers them both.

A deficiency of particular amino acids can cause problems with the hooves.  The white line can deteriorate if there is a deficiency of methionine.  This supplement is high in protein and does offer methionine.  However, several other hoof supplements offer more methionine, so if your horse has issues with his white line, take a look at Hooflex Hoof Builder or Farriers Formula Double Strength.

Hooves need both omega 3 and omega 6 fatty acids and this offers both, though twice as much 6 and 3, so this isn't the greatest supplement for omega-3 fatty acids, though you can buy those as a separate supplement.

Nearly all of the nutrients important to hoof health are also important to coat quality, so if your horse is lacking in both it is quite likely that a hoof supplement such as Horseshoers Secret Extra Strength will help.  If this one doesnt do the job, look for another that offers different hoof-related nutrition  perhaps one with more omega-3 fatty acides, more B vitamins, or a different mix of amino acids.

There is no one best hoof supplement, because what the horse is eating for the rest of his nutrition is such a big factor.  However, for most horses showing less than idea hoof quality, this is a reasonable starting point to see how they respond.",4.0,0

"After the solid third season, Frasier came back with what could arguably be its best season. There were new storylines: Martin meeting a new lady, Sherry (played by Marsha Mason), who doesn't exactly hit it off with the rest of the gang--as well as continuations of old ones: Niles trying to reconcile with Maris. The biggest story of this season, though, was off-camera: star Kelsey Grammer went into rehab, which necessitated that the others in the cast pick up the slack. They proved up to the task, of course, and upon Grammer's return the show became better than ever. In this season, we were visited by familiar faces like Lilith and Frederick for a memorable Thanksgiving episode, as well as Agent Bebe, as well as surprise appearances (James Earl Jones). In addition, this season contained some of the truly greatest episodes of this show: the opener, The Two Mrs. Cranes, had the show's farcical sense of its humor at its most potent, Ham Radio featured delightfully unhinged performances by the supporting cast, and Are You Being Served? features one of the show's funniest moments. This is where the show hit its peak: the synthesis of great acting, writing, and ensemble acting that made this show memorable. If you love Frasier, these episodes are probably many of the reasons why. If you only buy one set of Frasier DVDs, this should probably be it.",5.0,0

"Ordered this to frost my bathroom window. Followed directions to a T and the results were very impressive. There is no way to tell from sight that the windows were treated with a spray, no streaks, no thin coated areas of the glass. As long as you use it per the instructions it will work as intended. Now for the bad part. As I was putting on the final coat of the spray it started to sputter. There is about half the can left so no reason for it to seem ""out of gas"". Noticed an accumulation of the  spray in liquid form around the nozzle which seems to be causing the sputtering. If I can get the nozzle to work without sputtering then I can use it to frost one more window. I will try to clean it with warm water see if the nozzle will clean up for use, but if anyone has other suggestions I am open to it.

"Almost everyone from ""Stormriders"" is a Star Trek fan, and I'm not one of those people. But I am a Star Trek fan. The basic premise of the movie is that the crew of a space ship in the 21st century is infected by a virus that gives them the ability to control their own behavior. As they become infected, the crew become increasingly violent and insane. As the infected crew becomes more violent and insane, they become more violent and insane. The movie begins to get a little slow, but as it goes on, it becomes more realistic. The aliens seem to be having a blast, and it's kind of scary that they get on the ship and are able to control their behavior. It's a nice twist to the story. It's also a little hard to figure out who the good guys are. In the first movie, the bad guys were pretty bad. I guess this movie was trying to be a bit of a sci-fi horror movie, but it was a little too dark for me. I was hoping for a more more ""serious"" twist, but it just doesn't work. I don't think this movie is worth watching if you're a Trek fan. I would recommend it if you're a Trek fan. Also, if you're a Trek fan, you'll probably like the movie.

"I finally picked up the black version off of Woot for a great price. The lack of a flipper had put me off for years because I have sliced my thumb using the thumbstuds on 2 other Ken Onion blades I own.

It's certainly the best knife Kershaw makes and I have a dozen of them to compare it to.

It became my edc immediately and I just ordered the olive version so now I have 2. I'm sure I will get the s30v version as well, not that there is anything wrong with the sandvic. Some people have pointed out that the liner lock looks a little thin, and it does, but I haven't had any issues with it and don't anticipate any. If any improvement could be made on this knife in my opinion it would be to make it a beefy frame lock with a lock bar stabilizer.

"ECW Extreme Evolution
I had never seen any ECW before buying this, but this is what I thought of it...
RVD V Jerry Lynn
This is a good match, although it takes a while to get started because of RVD taunting. When it does though, the match makes up for the slow start. There's a nice table spot and lots of chairs. 7/10
Awesome V Tanaka
The best match on the DVD. 2 tables break and lots of chairs are used! There are some good bumps and lots of high-flying moves too. I was surprised at how good this was. 8/10
Barbed wire Match Raven V Sandman
It's bloody, brutal and lots of tables break. It could have been better though, because it's quite clumsy (the last table brakes before the move actually happens). Also, it was paced a bit too slowly. 7/10
Dudleys V Spike & Balls
This was pretty good, but I expected more. Spike jumps off a high ladder at the start, which is cool. Also he gets put through a flaming table, which is pretty good. 7/10
Eliminators V Williams & Gordy
This match was only on the DVD for the end elbow drop. It is not really that high, especially as Perry sits down. Shane McMahon jumping of the Titantron at WWE Backlash 2001 was miles better. The rest of this match was crap and not worth watching making this a waste of space. 3/10
Sabu V Taz
This was very far off the ""most amazing grudge match ever"", but it was still cool. I thought it would be more hardcore actually, although there are some good spots. They use tables and chairs. 7/10
Dreamer & Beulah V Douglas & Francine
I don't know why this was on the DVD. Tommy gets hit with a chair by a fan, but that's about it. At least it's better than the Eliminators' tag match though. Why they made it the main event I don't know either. 4/10

"My grandpa got me (and the rest of the grandkids) an economy version one of these on his last trip to Switzerland in the 80s. I still have it.

The one here is different in that the shield is embedded instead of stamped, and it also has a key/lanyard ring. The distinguishing features of this model are as such:

- There are no tools on the back of the knife. While this may be viewed as a negative by some, it gives the advantage that the backsprings are smooth and flush with the back of the knife, and it is therefore more comfortable in the hand, especially during extended use.

- It is the 3-1/4"" size. (closed) This fits better in the hip pocket than the much more numerous 3-1/2"" models. One can barely feel that it is there. If you like the smaller size, but want back tools, the Sportsman adds a corkscrew and reamer to the back, and drops the small blade in favor of a nail file. The Small Tinker (not available here at this time, despite the specs published here) adds a phillips and reamer to the back.

I bought this knife as a whittler. I figured the smooth back would make it more comfortable in the hand, and I was right. One does need to remove the keyring and grind off the nub, though, for true comfort. I also got a little too creative trying to turn the can opener into a specialized carving tool. When I ground off the hook at the base of the tool, that messed up the stop, and now it closed all the way into the handle. It takes an act of God to get it out now, so I kind of ruined the knife. Oh well, it is still good for whittling!

In stock form, the flat screwdriver tip on the bottle opener works well, and the small tip on the can opener works in a #2 phillips most times. Just take care that it doesn't close on your hand.",5.0,0

The set is good but I have a couple issues.

Second, and the worst part for me at least, the new keys it came with requires two of the same color pin for each key.

"Update August 8, 2012:

We've had this product for about a year now, and I'm still really happy with it.  It's definitely full from my dog, but we have not had any overflow issues.  I'm just about out of the powder that comes with the unit, so I'll need to get some more.  Otherwise, it's been a really convenient product to have.

I would suggest that you seriously dig the depth hole that they recommend in the instructions.  The deeper the better though as sometimes the dog poop will fall down in the hole when you flush the unit with water.

Original Post:

In all honesty, I was a bit pessimistic when I first got this thing a few months ago, but I was desperate enough to buy it.  Thankfully I did, as it's been a great addition to our household and in keeping out yard (and garbage) clean.

The unit is real easy to install.  Just dig a hole, shove it in, fill it up with water and the enzyme they give you, and you're off.  I am lazy with the unit, and normally just pick up our dogs (we just have one) poop on the weekend, and then every month flush the unit with 5-gallons of water and add more enzyme.  The thing seems to really be working.  We have dog play dates regularly, and the unit seems to be able to handle it.  Also, we're currently reaching 20 degree nights and 40 degree day here in Seattle, and it seems to still be working.

While this thing holds a lot of poop, I'm pleasantly surprised that there is not a horrible stench (sure it has a slight poo smell, but it's not gagging).  Definitely would recommend this unit to others who want to dispose of their dogs waste in their backyard.",5.0,0

"The Gentle Leader Headcollar is AMAZING!!! I have a 3 1/2 year old newly adopted rescue puggle who take way more after his beagle mother and has beyond an impeccable nose and sensing abilities. So our usual walks on a regular 6ft leash were more of him running towards all the different scent trails he smelled and me dragging behind trying to keep up while in the process of not being able to be as fast as him, he would pull on the leash, therefore choking/causing restriction to himself. I was not happy about this - not only was he uncomfortable, but so was I. This morning I was delivered the Gentle Leader headcollar and went home for lunch to test it out ..... WOW!!! Even after reading all the great reviews here, I seriously did not expect it to work on the first try, but was so very pleasantly surprised. No difficulty putting on, my puggle, Chewy, seemed comfortable with it on (although on occasion he did paw at it since he is not used to wearing something around his muzzle area) but did not show any sign of discomfort. With the first few steps he was beginning to walk by my side or a tiny bit behind me and followed my lead versus just running off after any/all random scent trails! I still allow him to follow all the scent trails he sniffs, but we do it at an acceptable rate versus having the 'zoomies' towards all the scents. This is just our first walk in the first day too!!

"What can I say? I'm a 5'6"" 40-something eventer with big horses and having a mounting block sure makes setting and resetting fences much easier.  I used to have a three-step block and unfortunately, the friend to whom I loaned it managed to break it (yep, really!).  So, missing my block, I ordered this one.  At first, I missed having that top third step, but after a week or so, I got used to it.
What I like:  Stability.  I have a youngster who is learning to stand still for mounting, and this block has a nice, wide base, so it doesn't move around easily.  I can get on and off 20 times, holding a fidgety youngster, and this block never threatens to tip over.  The steps themselves are plenty wide enough to allow for standing (not just stepping) on them.  The handle is built into the front instead of the back, which makes the block easier to pick up.  While substantial enough in weight, it's light enough to pick up and carry across the arena in one hand (while leading a horse with the other hand) without any real effort.

What I don't like:  I wish it were about 2"" taller.  Also, the recessed area on the back side (not visible in the product photos on Amazon) will make a very attractive nesting location for yellowjackets - a better design would be a straight side all the way down the back.  And finally, the steps are either slightly warped or designed to have a slight depression in the middle of each step.  This means the mounting block collects water and must be tipped off before using after a rainstorm.  I suspect this is a design element to enhance step stability, but the problem of water collection could be eliminated by drilling a small hole in the middle of the depression (I may do this myself).",4.0,0

"Great lead performances by Warren Beatty and Diane Keaton highlight this film along with great supporting performances by Maureen Stapleton and Jack Nicholson as Eugene O'Neill.

Beatty plays journalist John Reed, a journalist very passionate about his views and was witness to the Russian Revolution in the 1910's. The movie provides insights into his idealistic views along with his romantic relationship with Louise Bryant (Keaton) whom he had a very passionate but also quite stormy relationship.

Jack nearly steals the show as O'Neill, a man very much in love with Bryant despite the fact that her heart really belongs to Reed.

And Stapleton won a well deserved Oscar as Emma Goldman, a woman who shared a lot of the same views as Reed, and initially had no use for Bryant until much later.

The strainer has a slight tolerance defect that is easy to fix. The bottom of the strainer is slight bowed up holding the stopper too slightly too high so the water leaks out. Put the strainer on top of the open jaws of a vice and center a socket  over the stopper handle at the center of the strainer then hitting it downward. This causes the strainer bottom to now bow down a bit. This allows the O-ring to seat properly, problem solve. Yea water stayed in the sink all night.

"The popular British World War II detective series ""Foyle's War"" returns for an encore performance with Set Six and three new episodes set in the months following VE Day.  Michael Kitchen returns as Detective Christopher Foyle, still Chief of the Hastings Police Station but awaiting his relief.  Honeysuckle Weeks is back as Foyle's former driver Samantha ""Sam"" Stewart, now demobilized with a new job and a new relationship.  Anthony Howell is Detective Milne, just promoted to head of the nearby Brighton Police Station and negotiating an unfamiliar relationship with his former boss.  The new episodes are excellent, with hard-hitting historical context.  Detective Foyle has lost none of his passion for justice, while the return of peace hasn't done away with crime.

In ""The Russia House"", the search for a missing Russian POW turns into a complicated murder mystery with national security implications.  Foyle must deal with the intelligence services, a White Russian refugee organization, and a shameful wartime secret.

In ""The Killing Time"", the presence of African-American GI's at Hastings triggers a spate of racial prejudice.  A crime attributed to one of the GI's turns into a complex mystery.

In ""The Hide"", a newly retired Foyle, awaiting a long-cherished trip to the States, gets involved in the strange case of a British traitor who refuses to defend himself at trail.  The details of the case connect to a murder and an unexpected skeleton in Foyle's own closet.

The ending of the stories nicely accounts for the series leads without foreclosing the possibility of future reunions.  ""Foyle's War: Set Six"" is very highly recommended to fans of the series.",5.0,0

"I watched this DVD thinking it was the cure for everything.  It goes round and round about how things can happen if you think positively and attract nothing but positive things and prosperity.  But I didn't understand how.  How do checks come in the mail if you are not due a refund?  If you are forced to hang around or work with negative people, how can you stay so positive?  I have seen the makers of this movie talk on talk shows and they give much more information than is on this DVD.  I think you would need to take a thousand different scenarios and then ask them how to deal with them before you could apply this philosophy because it is very confusing.  Kind of like scientology is so confusing and needs intense instruction to learn, I believe this ""secret"" needs alot more information and instruction to apply it so that it works as it states it does.

"I added one of these hardwired Kidde/Firex CO alarms in our basement in the general area of the oil burner just in case there is ever a problem with flue gasses backing up. I have it interconnected with two other KN-COB-IC carbon monoxide alarms and four Kidde/Firex SA320CN Dual-Sensor smoke alarms located throughout the rest of the house. This CO alarm has a 9v battery backup in case of power interruption and will sound along with the other interconnected CO alarms when one of them detects a high CO level. It has its own distinct sound pattern to differentiate it from the sound the smoke alarms make. However, this CO alarm is apparently designed so that it will not also sound the interconnected smoke alarms, which would mean if you only had one of these CO alarms installed in a remote location of your home, like a basement, it may not be able to alert people in other areas of the building when it activates. So, the ideal solution would be to have one of these interconnected CO alarms on each floor in addition to smoke alarms. The alarm has a built in end of life notification feature that alerts you when it needs replacement with two chirps every 30-seconds. The Amazon product description above says this occurs after seven years of operation, but the actual User's Guide that came with it says ten years, so not sure which is correct. Overall, this CO alarm seems decently made and was fairly reasonably priced. Of course I hope to never actually have it activate from high CO levels in our home, but it's good to know it is there just in case.

Update: According to Kidde's website, the KN-COB-IC carbon monoxide alarms manufactured as of 2013 now have a 10-year end of life cycle, not 7-years as indicated in the product description above.",4.0,0

Anyway, I am currently sitting amongst the parts of this thing trying to figure how the heck to put it together bc these are the worst instructions I've ever seen!! And I put together a much larger cat tree earlier this year.

For example, the instructions simply tell you you should have 8 lg sisal posts. What they don't decipher is that there are actually 6 of one size and two slightly smaller ones. And of the larger ones, several are weighted. It doesn't tell you which to use where. I'm going to assume the heavily weighted ones go on the bottom...

The pics in the instructions are also horrible. They are blurry and unclear. Still trying to figure out which is a base. I'm just going to look at a full color pic and wing it.

Update: I got it ""put together."" It's in quotes because I think the one piece is broken because it won't stay connected. And parts are missing from the catnip toy station. Very frustrating... There are two 'catnip stations' which are basically a hanging fuzzy ball surrounded by plastic tubes so it looks like a little cage. I am missing six of those tubes so I can't put the other catnip station on. Which means there is no stabilization there. And even the one I did add... as soon as the cats touch it, it will just pop off. Nothing really keeps it together!

And I think there need to be more longer screws. They expect you to use the shorter screws in parts where it doesn't work. I am sorry I bothered with this one. Mistake...",2.0,0

"I was a tiny tot--like one of Don Draper's kids, at the time of the events depicted in this season, and this series makes me feel I can make windows into my parents' world, even into their souls.

Dick Whitman's transformation into Don Draper is a brilliant trope, which operates both on the level of metaphor and plot, & is key to characterization.

Even if Dick Whitman had never switched dog tags with his dead commanding officer in Korea, he would have done everything possible to reinvent himself--and obliterate his past.  His ambition drives him into a brave new world in which he, rather like a master spy, must be the bravest.  The new name and social security number make this much more real & palpable, while generating practical complications which fuel the plot and allow us tantalizingly brief glimpses of the bleak world which drove him to his desperate deception.

Poignantly, he hands his half brother $5,000, a large sum in the early 1960's, to, as Dick/Don puts it, ""make a new life for yourself,"" to be another ""Don Draper,"" and vanish from Don's world.  But his brother misses the mark.  For mysterious reasons, he hangs himself.  In doing so, the half-brother's feeble surrender to fate becomes not only a foil for Don's strength, and the boldness of his social/psychological imagination, but an index of the ruthlessness with which he is prepared to ""murder his past.""

Looking at this series from the outside, the sets, costumes, automobiles, & etc., are every bit as authentic as other celebrated period dramas like Downton Abbey.  And in the the social realm, the casual racism, sexism, and class consciousness is perfect down to every dowdy pleat in Peggy Olson's skirt, every limp lock of hair in her bangs, every note of assumed superiority in Peter Campbell's prep school accent.

"Considering how ancient the unit was that this replaced, a life of 2 years was a disappointment.  The company that installed it for Loews didn't repair them so we called another service.  The following is what I was told and I have no way of verifying if this was the straight scoop or BS.  The circuit control board was bad.  Probably for the following reason:  the track for the chain was in sections and vibrated when the door opened or closed and this transmitted to the motor unit and caused the board to fail.  The choices were: either order a new board, wait for it to arrive and pay for a second service call, or install a new unit.  We bought a new Guardian Model 628 with belt drive and a solid track that the tech just happened to have on the truck.  The technician pointed out that the door rollers were solid plastic and the black marks on the door tracks were where the plastic skidded and didn't roll and he had teflon rollers with ball bearings that were much better.  Several hundred dollars later I have to say 1) the belt drive unit is much smoother than the chain drive, and 2) the door, when pushed by hand, goes up and down with much less effort due to the ball bearing rollers.  I have no idea if what the tech explained to me was true, but the result is very good, if pricey.  None of this was expressed when I bought the unit so you might ask about chain drive vs belt drive - at the time I was told it was a question of noise, but no question the belt drive is smoother.  I was not offered a choice of ball bearings on the door rollers and I do think that bearing rollers are a good option if they offer it.",2.0,0

 Hume could go two ways: forgive or become a man of vengence.  Which way to go????

"...there's a specific audience for this type of film; most people judge them by the wrong standards. This movie was made with the same rationale and in the same spirit as spaghetti westerns, which fared a whole lot better, but riding on the success of Mad Max and Escape from New York. You have to LOVE a movie which manages to throw in every conceivable creature in a single feature, -for the sake of maximizing whatever little resources available and also save the audience time and money watching them in separate entries-, even ninjas, ex-soft core stars, fishmen, apemen, telepaths, killer blind monks, werewolves, etc... and manages to anticipate the idea behind such movies as The Running Man, while attempting to be something else. This is a movie in its very own league, not to be judged by any other standards; actually Joe D'Amato's favorite among all the colorful entries in his immense catalogue. I reckon from seeing Death Smiles on a Murderer, that David Lynch's place in film history should have been occupied by him instead, but there was just no market for such a thing in the Italian industry back then. So, he went, ""if they want rubbish,  I have no problem delivering just that.."" and the rest is history.  Made in the truest Ed Wood spirit, taking into consideration the man was ""ahead of his time;"" certainly, their kingdom was not of this world...

"The usual problem with reviewing cat toys is what to say when kitty doesn't like / use the toy. It's hard to evaluate a product made for cats as a human, so normally if I get a toy and Ms Cat does not like it, I say no harm, no foul and usually opine that someone else's cat may like the toy / furniture.

Not the case here. The entire premise of this toy is flawed, and I really don't think many cat owners or their pets will have much use for it.

First, the cat shown in the picture lounging on the arch of the X must have been a) very much smaller than normal cats and b) carefully trained. My own quadruped is very average sized and she could not at all lounge on this thing without drooping more than a third of her body off of it. Most cats will not willingly assume such a position, so don't think of this as furniture.

As a scratching post (and also as a theoretical lounging platform) this is also flawed, as it is very light weight and cheaply made. Cats will not use scratching posts that move around as they try to dig in, and this design is too light weight to offer the stability that a cat seeking to scratch is looking for.

My cat tried this once as a scratching post, after I poured catnip over it, and after it slid across the floor as she tried to stretch out, she turned her nose up at it and has not returned to it since.

Folks, if you want a scratching post, make sure it is solid and heavy. It will cost more than this does. If you want cat furniture, make sure it is solid and large enough to accommodate your cat. The designers of this product ignored these axioms and used a trained miniature cat to make it look more useful than it is.

Two stars, because your cat might like it as a scratching post if you can wedge it somewhere where it can't move around too easily.",2.0,0

"Any of those who would dismiss this movie for its allegedly senseless violence or because they feel it's a pale imitation of Pulp Fiction simply do not understand Mexican culture.  Violence, verbal or physical, proliferates in Mexican culture; I think many of the reviewers (mostly overly sensitive gringos, I would gather) who are uncomfortable with this movie would probably be equally uncomfortable with the Mexican view of life inherited from the Spaniards--i.e., the fatalism, the grim resignation to the frequent ugliness and brutality of life, and a sort of crude vivacity.  Pienso que estas personas que no les gusta Mxico no tienen cojones.  But then again, most people want illusion not reality at the movies, which brings up the next point.
As for the Pulp Fiction charge, this movie bears about as much relation to that movie as Picasso, in his early, rough stage, does to Andy Warhol's soup cans.  In Amores Perros, the violence, and, hence, the feeling, is real; in Pulp Fiction, it's trendy posing.  We cringe at the gore and we giggle at the jokes, then we forget the whole pop culture souffl Tarantino has served up.  The people in Amores Perros are blood and guts--crude, yes, and occassionally ugly, but there's no doubt they're the real thing.  Quentin Tarantino has never delved this deeply.
I give this movie four stars instead of five because it's still at times subject to a youthful impetuousness that fits the first story beautifully but not the other two.  It's not quite great, but it's still mighty impressive.  And the middle story about the model losing her leg and enduring a romantic crisis with her lover is in the end rather tiresome--it's undeniably felt by the actors, but it seems like tawdry bourgeois angst or an episode from a melodramatic telenovela next to the urban blight and horrors of the first and third stories.",4.0,0

"Our house came with an older Moen tub faucet that had been well-used. I bought this handle kit and a chrome escutcheon to dress it up. The handle came with a plastic adapter to attach it to the original cartridge, since the plastic knob has a horizontal screw holding it on, while this metal handle uses a vertical set-screw.
It all went together easily, but I had to disassemble and reassemble it a few times to get it working properly. The plastic adapter has a neat little assembly to restrict rotation, but possibly due to our setup, it wasn't long enough to stay in the stop tube. In other words, the water turned on fine, but then couldn't be shut off.
After removing a piece, the adapter and metal handle have been working fine, though I still feel a lot of slop in the connection. About an inch of the stop tube is exposed now, which doesn't look quite right, but again, I think it's due to our setup. I don't want to tear out the tub surround and replumb entire thing. If you're replacing a knob with this kit, just be aware it may not look quite as good as a new faucet. However, the price difference is substantial.",4.0,0

The one came on, the other I needed to use the pull chain for, however that's when I discovered their lack of quality. With the slightest pull on the pull chain the whole switch and bottom plate came off. In looking at where the screws go in, everyone of them was split. I took the other one down and examined it and it was in the same shape. I don't have time to mess with returning them and having a dark shop for a week or more while the replacements show up so I just drilled out where the screws go through and used small bolts, nuts and washers to mount the switch plate back on both of them. It won't come apart now, but I have doubts that these will even be functional in a years time with as cheap as they're made.",2.0,0

"Forget that this is War and Peace and just enjoy it as an excellent Hollywood movie.  If you want something that approximates Tolstoy's War and Peace, then check out the Russian adaptation made in 1968.  The 1956 Hollywood version is under-appreciated; the 1968 Russian version is over-praised.  It's a pity that we couldn't have the heart of the 1956 version and the intelligence of the 1968 wrapped up in the same film.

The solution:  If you want Tolstoy's War and Peace, then read it.  It's a long novel, but it not a difficult novel. But as far as movies go, the Hollywood treatment works well.

A few years have passed since I wrote the above review.  I liked the film even better on a third viewing.  It's not Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace, but it's a good movie.  Think of it as another Gone With the Wind.  Maybe this War and Peace only deserves 4 stars, but Audrey Hepburn always rates an extra star or two.",5.0,0
"Bunnies are of course prolific breeders.  But they can also make for some extaordinarily brutal killers.  Slasher fans need to hop! hop! on this dvd quick.

Writer/director Chad Ferrin (Someone's Knocking At the Door) is quickly establishing himself as a cult horror stud.  This movie is darn near perfect, melding violence, nudity, and touches of dark comedy with some very likeable protagonists and despicable villains.  Just some great writing, acting, pacing, characters, camerawork, bloody effects--this is all done in a very stylish, original fashion.

It's Easter time.  Mindy is the single mother of her 16-yr-old son Nicholas, who is mentally-disabled and has a hard time coping with the loss of his father.  When Mom brings home her new boyfriend Remington, the young kid instinctually puts up the red flag.  Then when Mindy leaves for work, we get to see first hand what a total scumbag this dude really is.  He invites over some prostitutes and other degenerate sleazeball buddies and the party is about to get bloody.  A mysterious killer in a bunny mask is ready to hunt, and it's more than Easter eggs that are going to dye.

Easter Bunny Kill! Kill! is undeniably a spectacular low budget gem!  4.5 stars.  Highly recommended to all you fans of deranged blood-splattered cinematic chaos and mayhem.",5.0,0

"I wanted to replace my living room lamps and these seemed perfect.  I ordered 2, but they didn't put out quite enough light to replace regular lamps.  They were super cool and I immediately got great comments on them.  I bought a third lamp immediately to brighten the room... and because I liked them so much.  All arrived in perfect condition and after a few months, I've still had no quality issues.  They perform as advertised.

They come with 2 serious down sides.  First, they take PLANNING if you plan to use them to effect.  They take about 7 hours to heat up enough to start flowing.  While heating, the lava doesn't really move.  Instead, they look like weird alien fetuses in lab jars.  I entertain a lot and always need to remember to turn them on by noon if I'm having guests that night.  Second, they are major energy hogs.  At 200 watts each, I'm running 600 watts of power for about 15 hours a day when I use them.  This irks me because the rest of my home is super energy efficient and I use LED lights whenever possible.  You gotta pay to play!

Overall, everyone loves them, and I do to.  But, I think one would have been a good accent, where 3 are a bit overkill and don't really put out enough light for anything other than ambiance.  I'll most likely split them up soon, putting them in different rooms so I don't have to use all 3 at once.

"It has my seal of approval, and I fully recommend it.  I bought 2 of the Gizmode water alarm detectors, several sensor pad attachments, and 1 sump pump attachments.  Despite their very small sizes and nearly negligible mass, they all worked straight out of the box as I tested everything right away.  I found that the sensor pad attachments were as thin as advertised yet fully effective - they fit quite easily under our washing machine, and water heater.  Though the simplicity of the sump pump attachment surprised me, it was none-the-less very sturdy and worked well, so I placed it intentionally low in the sump so it would sound off just before the pump would activate - and it did.  The alarm was just loud enough to hear on the 2nd floor so my recommendation to Gizmode would be to make it even louder - but it still gets the job done.  It is now at the perfect ""peace of mind level"" where it is high enough in the sump that it won't sound off unless the sump pump fails to work.",4.0,0

"Inspired by the Allan Ginsberg poem of the same name, HOWL shows the eponymous hero (James Franco) reading the work out lout to a group of fellow-poets in San Francisco.  The work obviously inspired extreme passions: the audience listen in rapt attention to a work that depicts the poet's feelings through an earthy yet compelling idiom.  In an attempt to show how the poem might work, directors Rob Epstein and Jeffrey Friedman introduce a series of animated sequences; none of them try to 'explain' the work, but rather show how Ginsberg's language works associatively, inspiring moods rather than following any logical sequence.  When the work was first published in the mid-Fifities, it was the subject of a famous obscenity trial: Epstein and Friedman restage that trial, showing how the poem was criticized for its apparent earthiness of language, and then cleared on the grounds that Ginsberg was only following the principle of free speech.  HOWL is an enthralling piece, encouraging viewers not to 'understand' the significance of the poem in terms of meaning, but to see it as symptomatic of a particular moment in American history, when old taboos and/or standards of moral or civilized behavior were subject to intense scrutiny.  The conservatism of the early Fifties had been superseded by a new spirit of adventure, encapsulated in Ginsberg's work, that looked forward to the spirit of the Sixties.  James Franco offers a convincing characterization of Ginsberg, supported by memorable cameos from David Strathairn, Jon Hamm, and Bob Balaban as the main protagonists in the court case.",4.0,0

"Toby, our 90-lb ""pup"", got too old to get in and out of the SUV on his own.  The Petstep saved the day.  Easy to deploy, easy to fold and stow.  You WILL crush your fingers ONCE while folding it up, but only once.  Sorta like a child and a hot stove. Live and learn.  I don't really see any way to redesign the edge to avoid this without making the Petstep more difficult to use.  By the 3rd day I was able to deploy it from the back of the SUV in about 5 seconds, and stow it in about 10 seconds.

From a dog psychology standpoint, I found that even after using it for a year, Toby still wanted to leap off the ramp when he got halfway down.  And his legs were not able to handle that, so I had to lead him down the ramp by holding his collar so he wouldn't try to jump off.  In the end, it was prostate cancer that did him in.  The Petstep is now stored in the garage and I'm sure we'll be using it again as soon as Lucy gets too old to jump in and out of the SUV on her own.  But she's only 6 so she has a few more good years I think.",5.0,0

"Imagine taking reality TV, Star Trek, and the movie ""Planet of the Apes"" to the extreme is an insult to the people of America and the world we live in.  This movie is a sad and depressing movie.

"I have a 7 month old kitten, three 6 year olds and one 16 year old cat. My 6 year old Tortie figured this feeder out instantly. As soon as I put the food in one tube and moved to another tube, she was emptying the first tube. Zero challege for her but she seemed to enjoy the act of scooping the food. The other two 6 year olds figured it out after watching my Tortie. She was a better teacher than i was. However, one of them only has one eye. His depth perception is off. So for him i sprinkled kibble between the tubes for him to have to reach between and get. That still slows down his food intake but is a bit easier for him. The rest preffer the tubes. My 16 year old had to start out with no tube, but in a half hour was fine picking treats out of the smaller tube. My kitten eats kitten food as shes still growing so, shes not interested at all in the feeder as it has ""yucky big cat"" food.

"I saw the preview of this movie on YouTube and was immediately intrigued. I had seen movies like ""A Thief in the Night,"" and those that followed it, but had never seen one of this caliber before.

Additionally, if I had not already been a Christian, this would've pushed me over the edge into becoming one.

"There are movies for all moods, for all tastes, for all
occasions. Some emphasize the dialogue, some the special
effects, others the story.

In this movie, there's a wide range or aspects that are
keep the viewers keenly watching the unrolling of the
movie, such that time passes quite quickly, and we get a
glimpse of a microcosm, surrounding the customers of a
small 7-11 style store in a major city.

William Hurt, plays a character that seems quite his own,
and natural, as does Harvey Keitel who reprises the
tough-guy with a big heart role.

The movie is not a chick-flick like many other movies,
such as Ashley Judd's SOMEONE LIKE YOU/ ANIMAL ATTRACTION
but it does have a very soft or human side to it, that
will appear perhaps to older audiences, meaning, those
over 23 ...since the emphasis is on the various tones of
human interaction, the small and introverted lifestyles
that sometimes people have in large city neighborhoods.
The key here, is showing people their human sides, and
willingness to grow, help their neighbors, and life in
peace with one another, responsibly.

Clearly, these types of movies, showing nostalgia, mixed
with urban living, realism, drama and responsibility in
each moment, are not the norm, considering the ""fantasy""
or ""unreal"" stories often chosen by Hollywood, that target
the below 17 age bracket.

Perhaps, at the end of the day, everyone will learn to
enjoy this small urban tale featuring OUTSTANDING acting
talent of William Hurt, and the legendary Harvey Keitel.

As for Ashley Judd, an extremely versatile and one of my
favorite actresses, she really does a shocking role in
this movie, playing a delinquent adolescent girl, not
unlike the other movie, NORMAL LIFE. This is the old Judd
that we used to see, in other movies of the same period,
such as Ruby in Paradise, or the Passion of Darkly Noon,
or a Time to Kill, or the Locusts, all great performances
with Judd. The later movies, seem to show a Judd in a
different phase of her life than before, but in
SMOKE, Judd's 5 minute performance will surely grab your
attention.

In terms of the DVD edition, the colors, sharpness of the

"ABOVE AND BEYOND is a quasi-documentary true life account of the role that Colonel Paul Tibbets played as the pilot of the B-29 Superfortress that dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima in 1945.  From start to finish, the focus is squarely on the pressures placed on Tibbets (Robert Taylor) and on his wife (Eleanor Parker) who must endure many months of separation from him, all the while with her never knowing his true objective.  Taylor plays Tibbets as a basically decent sort who has to confront early on that it will be his finger that will drop a bomb killing tens of thousands of Japanese men, women, and children.  There is a key scene when Tibbets' commanding officer gives him a button to push and tells him that if he pushes it, more than one hundred thousand will perish.  Tibbets responds by pushing it.  This sets the tone of the movie.  Tibbets has to be hard on himself so that the war may end sooner.  He understands a brutal paradox of war--that for thousands of his people to live, an equal number of the enemy must die.  His wife, of course, does not have the luxury of knowing what he knows and her reaction of resentment is eminently understandable.  ABOVE AND BEYOND is not a plot driven film.  It is no more than a straightforward recording of the pressures faced by one good man who knows that some sacrifices must be made to win a war.  And this is the problem with movies like this.  Tibbets and his wife are essentially static characters with no room for growth.  Taylor shows emotion by growing surly.  His wife becomes stressed out.  Yet the war itself seems little more than a backdrop against which one family plays out a series of squabbles.  The tragedy of war films in general is that such squabbles are often an inevitable result of the much greater carnage occurring discretely offscreen.",3.0,0

"PROS:
1. This allows you to get ""flatter"" against your work, so it's critical for certain tasks.

TIPS:
1. Don't run it too fast, or for too long.  Let it cool off from time to time.
2. When installing and removing shafts (the rod with the disc at the end), insert a spare shaft through the hole near the tip of the angle attachment, to prevent the main shaft from turning while you tighten or loosen it.

"This movie got SMACKED TO THE HILT by the critics - usually a sign that a movie is good.

In fact, it is not an 'amazing' movie - don't expect a masterpiece - but it is not bad by any way of measurement. Of-course, the flim 'deals' with the stereotype of working mothers, but before you write it off as predictable feminism the character Kate Reddy (played by Sarah you know who) comes across as a genuine, nice person. Even though Kate has an up-market jobs, a lot of the problems she faces are universal - lack of time to spend with kids, boss calling you in to work when you thought you had a special night with the partner, jealous colleagues and the like.

Unfortunately, her friend Allison is trotted out to give the hard-line men-hate-us mantra now and then, and the film tries to mock stay-at-home mothers; as if stereotyping stay-at-home mothers will 'break' the working-mother stereotype. But they recover that with good interplay between SJP and Pierce Brosnan, as Kate deals with a flirtatious but supportive superior.

You leave this movie feeling sorry for the situation Kate finds herself in, and the plight of the modern working people who are rushing through life, but some of the other characters are a bit one-dimensional and are meant to be demeaning, although it was only ever meant to be comical.",3.0,0

Typically, this means we're cutting matts out, which is usually a traumatizing event for all. Previously, we have just washed her with just a dog shampoo. It didn't really occur to me that we should be using a conditioner as well, until I came across this product.

We have bathed her and used the Everyday Isle of Dogs Silky Coat shampoo and conditioner several times now, and there has been a noticeable difference in her coat. Not only is her hair silkier but it matts much less often. She also smells great afterwards! We also have two Pug mixes and have used this shampoo/conditioner on them, so don't think it's for silky coated dogs only. It's worked wonderfully on all three of our dogs, regardless of the hair type.

I would highly recommend this shampoo/conditioner for any dogs prone to matting or if you just want to give your dog a smoother coat and a great smell!",5.0,0

"LOVE THIS COVER!! The quality is excellent and I love that it covers not only the back seat, but also the sides of the back seat, the floor, and the backs of the front seats. Before I got this cover, I had old blankets trying to protect my leather seats from 2 large labs!  And any other covers I purchased didn't fit well and ended up useless.  It has great coverage, awesome high-quality material, and is easy to install. Can be done in 5 minutes, or even less if you are in a rush and you skip some of the steps that fully secure it. There are many straps, buckles, ties, and fittings that attach it around headrests (rear seats and the front seats), tie around the seat belts, and fabric fittings that are meant to slip in the back of the seat and the sides of the vehicle as well as between the bottom of the seat and the back of the seat so that it does not slide around too much. It fits well in my Lexus ES350.  This does the trick of protecting the leather from their nails.  I especially like the generous flap that connects to the front seats and then hangs down to the floor to keep their hair contained, instead of flying all over.  I ordered the grey even thought my interior is tan.  I couldn't tell if I would like the tan shown in the pictures and I also have grey in other areas of my car so it blends well.  It was very easy to install but haven't figured out how to get the back of it to stay in place better but I feel like there is a way with a little help from my husband.  The main function is to keep the seat protected from their nails since I have the perforated leather that can easily be torn. I would definitely recommend!

"Shop Fox D3030 16-Inch Full Ext Drawer Slide 100-Pound Capacity Side Mount, Pair Review

I bought 2 pair of the Shop Fox slides to use for a custom closet build.

The super tricky part with these was to be able to get them lined up so that you don't have to move them to much. We reversed the mount so that it was under the drawer so that we could have a full width drawer in the cabinet. They slide really smooth and extend all the way with no issues. They also lock  back into place which is very nice to have.

Pro's
 100lbs capacity, they will be able to hold almost anything you can put on them
 Many different lengths, this review is for the 16 inch, but they have many sizes
 Super easy to install, just some screws and off you go

Con's
 If you using them with the bottom mount adapters we had to make our own hole for one of them, but worked out
 Can be annoying to line up and make sure they are level
 Gets your hands a little greasy if you mess with them a lot

Conclusion
For an overall project these are great. easy to work with and heavy duty. Take your time when installing them to make sure they line up and are level. Completely worth the price.",5.0,0

"I have a very-sound sensitive 8 year old child (as in, have had to flee any fireworks, gun shots, or anything even mildly loud since she was a baby).  Having a set of earplugs (that can be put in by her unobtrusively) and a set of ear muffs (when she is too scared to be self conscious) is a sanity saver for all of us.

The small version fits her and her older sister perfectly, and is slightly small for my normal head sized-husband (way to small for giant-headed me).  But with an open floor plan, I think I am going to get some bigger versions to have around the house.  I realized they could be invaluable if the girls ever start humming tunes from Frozen when we are trying to read.

PROS:

Very comfortable (size small works for my kids, get larger for adults)
They (semi) collapse to a somewhat smaller size (though do not fold down completely)
Solid (I can thrown them into a backpack without worrying about them)

"I rented this DVD only out of curiosity because I had heard of this often overlooked sci-fi entry made by Mario Bava. To be honest, given its' B-movie status, I was expecting a rather one dimensional gore-fest.

Nothing could be further from the truth. Even at this early point in his career, one can see how talented a director Bava is.

Clearly shot on a low budget, like Roger Corman, Brava, by using some very clever camera approaches and wonderfully creative sets (its' quite obvious the makers of the Alien films used this along with other 1950s' B-movies as sources)constructs a film that is both intelligent and engaging.

"The work light work OK so far. It charges via USB charger (they include both wall and car chargers). The charging port does not have a cover, so I am afraid it will get dirty or wet and it will prove fatal for the light.

The three moving lights can either be folded along the main body of the flashlight, or they can be spread out, but they cannot be brought up more than 90 degrees to the surface and cannot concentrate all four lights on one spot. I found it irritating, especially in tight spaces, where it would be nice to fold one of the sides more to the center to fit in a light corner. The magnet is strong enough to hold the flashlight horizontally, but just barely - it is very easy to knock it down.

The battery life was relatively good so far, and it charges rather fast, too. When the battery gets low, it turns off without any notice. You can turn it on again for a few seconds to find a charger. It does not charge and light up at the same time - if you plug it in and turn on, it will not be charging at all. Empty battery will stay empty battery.

The most irritating thing is that it has one button for multiple modes. When you first turn it on, it only lights up the end, as a regular flashlight. But when you are done, and want to turn it off and press the button, it lights up the three sides, effectively blinding you, unless you unfold the sides and direct them away. It needs on power button and one mode button.",3.0,0

In fact, his regular ""old dog"" gas was actually greatly reduced using this food, which is a major plus.  I also really like the fact that it has anti-oxidants.

too long & too slow

Keanu Reeves was probably the weakest link.  His British accent has been described as too posh.  His acting is wooden & unconvincing.

Frankenstein

Just did not work -- the beginning, middle, and end do not come together

While Branagh gets to show off his athletic torso that is not enough to save the film.

Something between Branagh & Helena Bonham Carter doesn't work.  They have no chemistry together?

There are so many things in this film that do not make sense.  For example, Frankenstein cuts off a head to use for the monster & uses a different brain.  So why is the monster's face a patch work of stitches?  Apparently, there was no reason why Frankenstein would use a different lip or cheek or eye, but the stitching was supposedly scarier.",2.0,0

"I actually ordered the Litter Genie by mistake and let it sit for months. Now that I am using it I find the whole process annoying. This review should focus on the refills. It would be so much better if they came pre-sized with strongly sealed bottoms, perforated to separate and start a new one so all we have to do is push the refill down into the chamber. The whole size guessing, having to try to balloon out the plastic in the bottom to guess what length to cut then tie a secure knot in the bottom and hope you have performed all steps well enough so no blow-outs upon removal is vexing. The built in cutter works smoothly so scissors aren't needed. I am refraining from commenting on the entire device but can't separate  the two that easily. It might be better if the refills were better designed. I have a large cat with large urine clumps. They don't fit in the scoop and are ~too large to dump in the top. I use hard clumping scoopable litter. I wonder how messy it must be with old-fashioned clay, pine pellets or other media? I get tired of used litter scattering about during transfer, on the floor, the handles, the lip of the entrance and such.
I plan to use up the refills and donate this thing because my old large efficient sturdy scoop+ brown paper lunch bags collected into repurposed bags works better and is cheaper.
How about odor? I haven't quizzed friends but should. I am concerned because my cat has stopped defecating in his box since this was added and it is the ONLY change.

"I have kinda a love/hate relationship with these flashlights. I love that they are super affordable and you get three flashlights. They are plastic, not aluminum, but the tolerances seem tight and they appear relatively water resistant. I left the floodlight on last night and after 4-1/2 hours the light intensity was down to about 25%, but still usable.

The non-focusing flashlight produces a tight, bright beam that easily illuminates objects 50-75 feet away. The light bar floodlight works great for close up work or will light half a room bright enough to read. The rubberized flat black exterior is nice and ""grippy."" The magnet is sufficient to hold the light vertically or horizontally on smooth sheet metal.

Ugly? Oh, man I so wish they provided directions on how to open these suckers up to insert the batteries! (3 AAA--not included) TIP: half the textured base near the magnet (opposite the on/off switch) slides open. There is a faint black arrow at the opening.

The bad? These lights have three settings--flashlight, floodlight and flashing red LED lights. Two of my flashlights worked perfectly, but the flashing red LED's never worked on the third. No biggie and I'm keeping them all, but it bodes ill for the reliability.

Still, these things are so cheap I can't complain--much.

"I have to put the disclaimer out there that we are not done training!! This is why I've only given 4 stars. I had to pause in the training as we went away (kitty went with) and didn't want to thoroughly confuse the poor guy!

I have a young Maine Coon. He's approx. 17lbs. The CitiKitty has no trouble holding his weight. I considered toilet training after meeting a woman who has four cats and 1 bathroom. She and her husband trained their four cats to all use the toilet. It made me chuckle when she told us about it, but it stayed in the back of my mind.

I got tired of stepping in litter - the Big Naughty is a slob! - and remembered the toilet training scenario mentioned above and decided to look into it.

Week 1:
The first week this worked really well. The Big Naughty didn't have any accidents.

Week 2:
After removing the inner ring, Naughty wasn't as big a fan of going on the toilet. He had a few accidents, and once he started going on the toilet again he decided he didn't like (or couldn't figure out) to go poo in the toilet; so he would go on the floor beside the toilet. As suggested we kept the ring at the week 2 mark for an extra week, but then I went away for the holidays and took him with me so I decided to put the training on hold until after we returned so as not to confuse him.

I've yet to commence training again, I have quite a busy schedule. I am looking forward to starting again and completing the training. I dream of the day I do not step in the scattered litter on the bathroom floor, no longer having to sweep litter up daily, no longer buying litter, no more scooping litter, etc.

I will update more thoroughly once we make the concerted effort to train again.",4.0,0

"This documentary is in my opinion a valuable expose of the credit card industry's ""back room"" techniques to get us consumers in debt and keep us there.  It shows the methods credit collection agencies use to get people to pay, and how those who are the least able to support a lot of debt in their lives are the most profitable people for credit card companies to get hooked into going into dept.  I learned a lot, and I think most anyone would benefit from seeing this documentary.

The two problems I had with this documentary were as follows:

First, it seems that all the average people (bankrupt or near-bankrupt consumers) interviewed in this film were portrayed as victims of the credit card industry, with no question as to how responsible or irresponsible these people might have been.  The bottom line is that credit card companies make people poor, keep them poor, and of course President Bush played right into their hands by championing the recently passed revisions to US bankruptcy laws.

The second problem I had was that although there is no narration, there are black slides with white text, and for some reason the editors picked a very hard to read font design and used it to create tiny paragraphs in the middle of a mostly black screen.  Not only that, the slides aren't up there very long, so be ready to hit the pause button on your remote so you can read the narration.

"It's no surprise that the film has been hailed as a classic, as it is a strong one.

But the film's most famous film is the fight between the two leads, played by Christopher Walken and Keanu Reeves, as they are trying to overcome the two men who are leaving a woman in a wheelchair to save her mother.

The film is so brutal that it is difficult to understand why it took Reeves so long to get the film off the air.  But it is a compelling one.

""The Hood"" is one of those films where the camera is shooting it's moments of terror.

Well, the antidote to any potentially great movie is Bruce Willis.  He's no Kevin Costner now, I'll grant you that.  But he's very near the bottom in terms of acting ability.  In this flick, we're not really sure if he's mentally challenged or an adult or what. It's hard to tell since Willis seems that way in real life.  Not the sharpest tool, if you will.  His lack of acting chops ruins an otherwise great movie.  Hopefully, someone will do it again with a real lead actor who knows how to ... act.",2.0,0

"Having watched the original series as a teenager, I was not too sure what to expect from this reincarnation of an American icon.  All I have to say is that I was not prepared for the next two hours.

There were familiarity as well as twists and turns with several shocks tossed into this stew.  At times I said to myself how could they do that or why change the original storyline?

At the end as the credits began and that music which we all knew so well, I said to myself that was exciting.  It all made sense.

There were some very sad scenes.  There were many heroic moments in the face of  death.

The Enterprise was a marvel to behold.  You could see how over four hundred federation representatives could fit on this flagship.

The actors did a noble job of living up to the legends with some twists.  The love interest was, well, you have to see it for your self.

If you go see this with a lot of Star Trek lore tucked away in your brain, be prepared to be unnerved.  If you know little of the original series or films, then this should give you a good introduction to the mythology which has been a part of our culture for the last 43 years.

"If you aren't able to open the door for your dog all day - or can't get there fast enough while potty training - this is a really good solution for the price. The color matches my old aluminum door perfectly and it took my 4.5 month old puppy learned to use it in about 5 minutes. He really seems to love it. MOST IMPORTANT: unless you have a brand new sliding door and live in Southern California, plan on buying different weather stripping. I used expanding weather seal tape made by M-D (http://www.amazon.com/M-D-Building-Products-03100-Compressible/dp/B007NG6IJ6) on all the sides and top of the panel and it solved the gapping/draft issues (my aluminum sliding door is about 70 years old and it's not exactly still square). You could also use a less expensive foam weather seal tape, but I think this one seals/insulates much better in extreme temperatures. My puppy is tall (labradoodle) and about 35 pounds right now and I'm glad I got the extra large door because it will accommodate his growth and gives him extra height for jumping in while he's little and awkward. When you measure for the panel, the total height should include the recessed space of the track where the door fits. I measured wrong: the entryway height of my door is about 80 inches, but the height including the recessed track (where the door fits) is about 82 inches (which is not a standard size) so this didn't quite fit. To fill the gap between the upper surface of the recess and the top of the door, I used the M-D expanding weather seal tape and it worked great.",4.0,0

"Loved it!  I enjoyed all the references to the hokey celebrity xmas specials of my youth.  And the nod to Pee Wee Herman's xmas special - a classic.  I nearly fell out of my chair laughing when Stephen chimed in on Willie Nelson's homage to xmas weed.  It's a direct musical quote from the strangest xmas duet of all time --- David Bowie and Bing Crosby singing Little Drummer Boy.  YouTube it.  It was surreal then, it's surreal now.  Hats off to the songwriters.  Very, very clever all the way around.  And Jon Stewart!!  What a gem!  (""And now, for the Hannukah portion of the show . . ."" to quote Mrs. Rene from Pee Wee's show.)

"This is turly the film the defines what little good (if any)that came out of the bad war. A story of the few victories the the American forces face.
Most of the battles in Vietnam were fought in back roads, and backyards, and very few large scale battles. This showed the horrible price that US troops pay in the first real offensive battle.
A platoon was pinned down, and other platoon rush to there rescue, only to be slaughter WWI style, the final battle sence, a classic unrealistic WWII battle charge.
But remember this was the very START of the conflict, and we knew little about jungle and gurilla warfare.
There was only one thing that cheezed me. It was Moore's (Gibson)
remark on the M16. ""It's a good rifle.""
Sure the M16A1 was a great rifle, A2 even better, but the oringal M16 by Euegne Stoner (if my history is correct) was a HORRIBLE rifle, it was rumored to be self-cleaning which lead to

"After watching  a couple episodes of ""An Idiot Abroad,"" I had trouble sleeping because of the suffering of this man.  The look on his face as he looked up at his would be captors showed a level of fear, confusion and pain which I found to be unbearable to see.  Having watched ""Extras,"" it seemed impossible to believe that Ricky Gervais would deliberately cause a person to be sick, hungry, sleepless and afraid.
  At the beginning of the episode where Karl is in China, Karl says ""is he havin a laugh? and I thought that perhaps Gervais, Merchant and Pilkington are `avin a laugh"" on us and that this was a deliberate reference to ""Extras."".  I hope that is the case.  This would mean that the viewers are shown to be the sadists that those who made the show suspected they would be.  I also began to doubt that Karl is the childlike person he is portrayed as being because although childlike people say funny things at times, they tend not so say funny things continuously. Also, Karl Pilkington makes no funny comments about a man whose face is deformed.  Perhaps Karl Pilkington is a very clever man who is good at keeping a straight face.",2.0,0

If you don't get a solid piece, the plastic part will fall off and the plastic part will stick to the floor.

"We've all heard the premise before, we all know how it's going to end, but few films take us on such an marvelously silly ride as 'The Other Guys'! This film is played completely for laughs and at no point do you think anything happening is real. It's funny as the only film that came to mind when I watched this movie was Steve Coogan's 'Hamlet 2'(even more hilarious!), which is a different story, but has the same loopy feel. Coogan has a fairly small but intricate role here, but I suspect he helped with the humor or they chose him to be in this because he had the right amount of kookiness they were looking for.

Ferrell has never been funnier and Walberg proves he can do comedy in this farce with a mission to bust your gut! I laughed out loud throughout this crazy flick and it was a welcome change from the standard buddy film.

"Maybe if you have a dog with a wide mouth you might need to make a small change. I think it's a good idea to have some guidelines when it comes to how much food you should give your dog.

If you have a dog that's sensitive to eating something that is hard to digest, I'd suggest changing that up a bit.

"I have had dogs for over 30 years and have used a wide variety of crates. I currently own the larger MidWest iCrate, a larger 'generic brand' crate, this size in 'generic brand', and an extra large all steel crate, along with many airline style travel crates.

When I recently acquired a new 4 pound puppy, the MidWest iCrate was my first choice in new crates to buy for him.  The 24 inch size is ideal for this size puppy and the 12 pound dog he will grow into.  The crate is NOT meant to be used for a puppy that is going to grow into a very big dog (such as a Golden Retriever or Labrador).  It is just not sturdy enough for a big, strong willed puppy.  In that case, get the crate the puppy will need as an adult and use the barrier the comes with it to divide it when the pup is little.

This crate is meant for a small dog, therefore a small puppy. And for that, it is perfect.  The double set of doors allows you to set it up in a variety of locations and still have access for the pup.  We currently have it set up lengthwise with the side door left open for easy access.  The puppy can come and go as he pleases to access his pee pads at night in the kitchen, and then return to his crate to sleep.  He LOVES his crate and willingly runs to it at night to lay down and sleep while we babygate him in the kitchen. When compared to the generic crate that I have, the MidWest crate is made from a higher gauge wire, it assembles together tighter, and it just seems sturdier overall. The plastic pan is a heavier weight and is holding up well.

I definitely plan on always using MidWest crates in the future.",5.0,0

"My wife recently endured ""The Big C"" herself in real life and wanted to see this show, so I bought the first season for her to view.  Having gone through her ordeal with her (and thus being labeled a ""caretaker""...who really took care of whom?, is my question) I sat down and watched these DVDs with her.  This is a very entertaining series!  Bravo, ShowTime, for creating a great show!  However, this woman has problems.  She's in denial, she wants no one to help her, she doesn't want other people to know about her condition...the exact opposite of what my wife endured.  My wife let EVERYBODY know that she had cancer, and as a result friends and family came rushing to her aid; her support group meant everything to her and made her ordeal that much easier to handle.  Three years later she's not only a survivor, and meaner than ever at that (I'm proud to say that I'm back to getting my much deserved weekly beatings), but she's an advocate for other cancer patients who do not have the friends and family to support them in their time of need.  Perhaps the moral of this series is that no one can suffer the disease alone...everyone needs a support group...and by denying her condition to herself and others she's doing herself a disservice.

"i have been using this DVD for over 5 years.  i reach for it when i don't want to jump around.  the movements are slow and steady, deceptive. it takes time, proper breathing, and strong core to achieve the effortless grace.  i still haven't mastered the ab work out (the last part).

**About the workout:

I've owned several workout DVDs with the name ballet in the title.  IMO Ballet Conditioning feels more like taking a ballet class than the others because it is pure ballet, not pilates and not yoga.  The other ballet workout DVDs all have pilates and yoga.

Also, the workout concentrates on core and lower body strength, both vital to ballet dancers.  If you want equal attention to upper body/arms/shoulders, you won't find here.

**About the music:

i mute the dvd and use the CD ""Adagio by Herbert Von Karajan"".

Ballet + adagio classical music = peace + calm + relaxation

this dvd is the best when i need to forget about the world and just breathe and concentrate on movements.",5.0,0

"""Back and Back and Back Again,"" the movie's third act, which also features the first two episodes of the movie, is the most solid film in the genre, and it is especially effective with the five-star ratings.  The story is told in a rather simple and almost eerie way, with a great cast of characters and a good story.  The only problem is that the film is very short, with the first half of the film taking up most of the screen time.  The film is shot in a very small window, and the picture quality is quite poor.  There is a scene where a man is walking through the woods, and there is a scene where the sound of the woods is played to a loud and clear volume.

"I had fun watching ""Bad Teacher."" It's not a great film by any means, and I don't plan on repeated viewings, but it was enjoyable to watch once.

What's interesting about the film is that it's about a character that is completely morally reprehensible, and yet still comes across as likable. Much of this probably has to do with Cameron Diaz, who is just such a likable actress. She's a beautiful woman with a knockout figure and a mega-watt smile, and yet she's so goofy and willing to make fun of herself that even when she's playing nasty characters it's hard not to find her charming.

And boy is this character nasty. She's greedy, she's lazy, and she's selfish. She lies, she steals, she manipulates. What's also interesting is that the storyline of the repugnant central character, Elizabeth, does not fall into either of the two clichs that you'd expect from a Hollywood film:

1) She does not end up finding herself inspired by the children and discover a love of teaching, revealing a heart of gold hidden beneath her prickly exterior.

2) She does not find herself getting her comeuppance for being such an awful human being.

If anything, the characters in the film who are depicted as truly pathetic are Elizabeth's sincere, hardworking fellow teachers. Is this a dubious message? Perhaps. But the performers are all so funny and likable (Lucy Punch and Justin Timberlake are both hilarious) that they manage to make up for the film's many flaws.",3.0,0

"Most T.V. viewers already know the Bob Newhart show from the number of times it's been syndicated. If you haven't seen it recently, now is the time to give it another look and see comedy which was driven by good writing rather than by overused and/or hackneyed sitcom plots. It's also a pleasure to see humor which isn't nasty or negative. The Bob Newhart show is downright ""fresh"" when viewed alongside current comedy fare.

As for the complaints about the packaging and lack of extras, one has to consider the *extremely* low price for the season and the experience Fox had with the Mary Tyler Moore show (another classic of the same era). Fox gave the first season of the Mary Tyler Moore show the star treatment and a higher price to cover the cost and it sold poorly. This made them reluctant to even release other classic comedies and the Bob Newhart show may never have seen a DVD release.

While I would have liked to have seen an interview with Bob offering some memories of  his experience with the show (or introductions), I think this type of comedy doesn't benefit much from commentary since the humor is in the pacing and the dialog. Talking over the show would seem rather disruptive and pointless. Also, I'm not sure how much anyone could remember from a show that aired so long ago.

As for the packaging, I like the slim cases and wish all DVDs were released in them. The thicker cases just take up more space on your shelves. Besides, it's what is on the discs that really matters and this show's humor has aged very gracefully. It's a delight to watch again.",5.0,0

When an accident happens and things go too far, their community unravels and people are exploited by the media and shamed by the public. It's a very sad story, but one worth watching. I feel particularly badly for the animal companions who were confiscated or sold away in the aftermath of this event.

There are confusing elements to this documentary, particularly in regards to which interviewee is narrating--I recommend watching it with the subtitles running. It lost me at points. There are definite flaws in the storytelling, but it's still so compelling that I put up with those flaws.

"Our oldest cat of 10 years has been having some GI tract issues that were occasionally causing him to have bloody stool. Sprinkling this stuff on his food has really made a difference and has greatly reduced the frequency in which that happens. None of our cats bat an eye before chowing down when they see it sprinkled over their food, so it must taste pretty good to them.

With this latest box that we ordered we noticed that nearly half of the packs were not properly filled and contained much less Fortiflora than they should have, but within 2 hours of bringing it to the seller's attention they agreed to send us a replacement box from a different batch so I didn't let that affect my rating of the product since it has worked so well for us.

"I was in love with this LED bulb until today when I took a multimeter to measure the current draw and calculated the wattage.  It turns out this bulb consumes about 8.0 Watts!!!  That's a far cry from the ""3.6 watts"" claimed on the package.

G7 Power no longer sells this bulb on their website and I wonder why.

This bulb was not the first to misrepresent the energy savings and won't be the last, but I'm just surprised at the big discrepancy.

CFL bulbs are the worst offenders when it comes to exaggerating the actual energy savings.

Some examples of the bulbs I have at home:

G7 Power ""3.6W"" vintage LED actually uses 8 watts.
A no-name ""23W"" CFL actually uses 43 watts
An Ecosmart ""14W"" CFL actually uses 24 watts
A Sylvania ""9W"" CFL actually uses 18 watts
A ""10.5W"" Philips LED bulb actually uses 21 watts.

Most LED bulbs I have are quite accurate in stating the watts, but there are clearly exceptions. The Cree bulbs I got are accurate in the stated vs. actual energy usage.  All my incandescent bulbs are very accurate in the stated energy usage.",2.0,0

"Fright fans, rejoice: thrills have been found again.

""Tales of the Dead: Grim Stories of Curses, Horror and Gore"" is an exploration of suspense. Divided into four vignettes, the film offers a variety of Halloween pleasures--each certain to impress those craving more than the standard cinema fare.

In this meet of multiple genres (each story chronicles a different element of horror, from the paranormal to the all too real) viewers will be offered a relentless pace and satisfying conclusions. The film does not falter as it changes tones and characters. It instead generates intrigue. This marks it unique among the typical plots. There are no tedious interludes or wasted moments. There is instead simply tension. It allows each individual to remain captivated; and this is a rarity.

What is not so rare, however, is the one flaw ""Tales of the Dead"" bears: its special effects. Like so many of its kind the film is limited by a too tiny budget. This forces occasionally laughable results and poorly constructed attempts at terror.

Those attempts are not enough to ruin the experience, however. While they may cause the viewer a momentary regret, they will still be countered by efficient storytelling and convincing acting--which offers far more than mere effects.",4.0,0

"This is the most beautiful mini-series you're liable to see. A modern woman from contemporary New York City still living with her father ends up on an adventure beyond her imagining when a gateway between her world and the strange and surreal world of the 9 kingdoms is opened. The 9 kingdoms is an alternate reality where the fairy tales are strangely true and wolves (werewolves actually) do seduce young women, princes are put under wicked spells and dark, deep secrets are hidden behind the villainous wicked queen. (I won't spoil it for you.)

One character I love in particular in this is the neurotic Wolf. Wolf is a half-wolf (werewolf) and apparently a descendant of The Big Bad Wolf. Wolf becomes the love interest in the story.

There are some amazing acting talents in this mini-series including Diane Weist in her very first villain role. It's shocking to see her out of the sugary sweet motherly role we're used to such as her role as Peg in Edward Scissorhands and the mother role in Lost Boys.

Another thing I like is the beautiful yet full figured woman who played Snow White- the actress from the practice. The writers paid close attention to detail in remembering that the original Snow White story's protagonist was fair and plump and they didn't follow the modern trend of the sickly-thin conception of beauty.

The fairy tales return to their roots with this mature- yet decent enough for people of all ages- fantasy. It's simply beautiful.",5.0,0

"Lighting can set the mood, whether you want a relaxing atmosphere or and exciting one, lighting can be used to create it. I received the Ohuhu Ocean Wave LED Light Projector and Speaker to review and it is wild!
This is more than an average light changing lamp. A small disc over the 12 LED lights moves while projecting the light through the 5 1/4 inch rippled lens, creating wonderful, ever-changing waves across the ceiling, wall or any surface it is aimed towards.
The patterns and colors are mesmerizing! The push of a button takes you to the next color. There are 8 different color patterns taking you from a multi pattern to red, to blue to green. Pick one that fits you mood.
This lighted orb also contains a speaker and an input to plug in your mp3 player, computer, your phone, etc so you can enjoy your music at the same time.
The projector can be operated off a wall outlet via the included outlet adapter or it can be operated off a USB device. You can take this almost anywhere to enjoy the hypnotic waves of color. It automatically turns off after an hour. I do wish there was a switch to deactivate the auto off for times when you want it to stay on longer. It's not that big of a deal to push the button to turn it back on though.
I love just turning off the light and having this cast waves over the ceiling and walls while watching TV or working on the computer. It gives me a tranquil feeling that calms me and lets my mind relax a little.

"Earth Songs (2012) - (Narrated By Michael York - Actor), (Directed by Brian Luke Seaward - Expert in stress management, mind-body-spirit healing) is the most succinct argument against doing what may have been intended to be an inspirational voice-over in an otherwise visually breathtaking production I've seen recently.  I'm writing this as I'm almost done watching the program on 'mute'.  I frankly couldn't take the insipid palaver.  For about two minutes at the beginning, I was hoping the pap-y-talk would change to something informative or smarm-free.  It didn't.

Here's proof that a fairly accomplished actor with a British inflection can't actually keep up with stunning cinematography when trying too hard to say grammatically correct but meaningless, flowery verbiage.  The attempt to sound poetic is pathetic.  This production is the 'nature' equivalent of the Roman Polansky film Tess (1979) - Gorgeously shot, lifeless, bland, and numbingly tedious.  You find yourself wishing that something would happen.  It doesn't, but Michael York drones on relentlessly anyway.

If you're considering watching this production, let alone buying it, I'd recommend you find something interesting to watch instead.  That way you won't miss the good parts due to having your head snap back, swallowing your tongue, and dying a horrible death from the verbal anesthesia in this production.",1.0,0

It wasn't difficult to see that Kevin had a serious behavioural problem early on, as a viewer it was quite clear.  However, as a parent it would be very difficult to admit your child had little or no conscience  at all and was capable of committing such heinous acts.  My heart went out to Tilda Swinton for trying to deal with a child she realized had serious problems, with no one to turn to for help or guidance, it was quite hopeless.

"FINALLY, I found a cat litter that's worth it's weight.  I live in a very small space, have one cat but *hate* kitty litter peppered all over my floors. I also dislike coming into my cozy little living space to smell cat litter dust or worse...cat waste.  This litter is finally the one I will stick with, after changing litter brands with every bag for almost a year.  This litter tracks significantly less and smells significantly less than any clay or recycled litter I've used.  I still have to tidy up the floor mat outside of her box after a couple days but it actually stays on the cheap small mat! I was worried I was going to have to buy a $40 special mat to catch the litter she throws out of the box like confetti.

It also doesn't smell. At all.  I have a sensitive sense of smell and I can't smell it when I walk in the condo, even though the box is 10 ft from the door.  I used all 5 lbs. in the box at once to help encourage her to cover her waste (laziest cat ever) and it's keeping the odor down very well.  I don't attempt to scoop the urine out but I do scoop the poo about every 2-3 days.  I've had the same litter in the box for 2 weeks now and no smell and the cat hasn't protested!  There is still plenty of dry litter for covering in there still as well - quick absorption.

I give this product 5 stars, despite it's higher cost, because it's not stuck to the bottom of my feet and it doesn't smell like litter or cat pee in my house.  Is that too much to ask from other litter companies?! I think not.",5.0,0

So far (2 weeks in), they've sprung right back and there's no sag at all in the material, but I'm a little worried about down the road. Especially since the large bed is rated for 100lbs I think.  For the extra $30, I'm glad we have the aluminum one in her cage.  It has stood up to DETERMINED chewing, scratching and gnawing without any indications of wear except a small (quarter-size) bit of chipped/gnawed off paint on the corner piece.",4.0,0

"I know about flashlights.  Nothing in this review will be an exaggeration, honestly.  This light is not usable in any sense.  The output can only be described as dim.  Thats not a comparative statement.  The ""beam"" is orange and barely visible.  If you're looking at something small within 2ft of your face,  you can see it if you strain your eyes.  Negotiating the dark is impossible.  Ive honestly never seen a dimmer light in any size, and this one is alot larger

"Awesome movie.  I've always been a fan of the conspiracy movies made in this era (Marathon Man, Three Days of the Condor, The Conversation among the best) and The Parallax View does not disappoint.  While the scene where Beatty pays for a plane ticket while actually seated on the plane certainly reflects a different time, the race to determine the source of the conspiracy and underlying tension of the scenes is palpable.  A young Beatty without all the mannerisms of his future self carries the film with a strong supporting cast including Hume Cronyn.  Unlike many movies in this genre, the conspiracy doesn't consume the acting.",4.0,0

"This is a fine piece of filmmaking, with a lot of twists and turns. I was surprised to find that the film is very much based on the book by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, but it's a little bit of a stretch to think about the book and Doyle's characters. The book is a bit too long, and it's a bit over the top. There are some great twists and turns in the book, but there's not much to it. It's very much a matter of style, and it's not about the character. There is some action, but it's a little too fast and predictable. I really liked the movie, and I found it to be a fun ride.I have been a fan of ""The Mummy"" for years. I've watched it many times and have enjoyed it the most.

"This movie was much better that I was expecting. It had some great one-liners and is the 1st best comedy of the year. Ice Cube and Kevin Hart were perfectly matched and played to each other's comedy style very well. Hart plays Ben Barber, a jumpy security guard who plays video games and in love with James's sister, Angela. James hates Ben and wants nothing to do with him. When Ben is accepted at the police academy, James decides to take him on a 'ride along' to show him what the police world is really like. Throughout the day, James gives Ben silly assignments that no one else wants. It all leads up to a confrontation with Omar, the main villain that James is obsessed with catching.

2. This unit included a wireless unit that I could put in my master bedroom to monitor the temp in there.

Actually I have come to own a digital thermostat because when we went on vacation over the summer weekend, I forgot to turn off the AC and it ran on the hottest days. That was a lesson learned. I won't be having that issue anymore.

There was some work to be had during the installation as I had to access my furnace in my attic to tap into the main wire set. The Ecobee does not run on batteries so it needed to have an extra module hard wired in. It was difficult but just difficult getting around my attic.

This is a nice feature, and a great addition to any drill.  The drill is a good drill, and one that I use often.

The drill is a bit small, but not too big.  I've had it for a while now, and the size of the drill is good enough to hold in my hand.  I prefer that the drill is smaller than my older drill, but that's not really a big deal.

The motor is very quiet, and the motor is very quiet.  The motor does a good job of controlling the speed, and I find that it is very quiet.  I don't have any problems with it, and it's not going to hurt my head.  I'm very happy with the motor.  I just wish it had a bit bigger to hold it.  It's a very quiet unit.  The motor is very quiet, and I find it very quiet. ",2.0,1
"To preface, I have a one year old pit bull mix who chews through EVERYTHING. The only toy she has yet to destroy is her black kong, of which she doesn't actually chew on too much. That being said, this seemed like a pretty sturdy toy so I got it since she loves squeak toys and I was looking for something that would actually hold treats and make her work for them. It took about three weeks for her to chew off one of the legs, at which point the toy was still functional, and was actually longer than I was expecting that particular leg to last as she started chewing on it the day she got it. A week later the belly started to tear at one end of the insert, but again, was still functional. A week after that, she chewed through the middle of the body leaving all but the squeaky head (of which she isn't particularly interested in due to the force it takes to make it squeak) no longer functional. Overall, it lasted around 5 weeks, which while I obviously wish it had lasted longer, I'm still generally pleased with the length of time it lasted considering the amount it was played with (a lot but not a TON). I'm considering getting another one but haven't yet decided. I wish they'd make something similar but without legs.

SUMMARY:

PROS:
-Holds up pretty well with major chewers, and probably indestructible for other dogs
-Multi functional as chew toy and very interactive treat dispenser (as well as floats and what not)
-kept my dog occupied when filled with treats or kibble (kibble worked best actually)
-cute
-squeaker isn't too loud

CONS:
-not indestructible for big chewers
-the stupid legs (They're it's weakest point)
-the amount of pressure needed to squeak the head made my dog disinterested in its squeaking ability (but was interested for food purposes)
-Price (which would be totally reasonable to me if it lasted for more than 5 weeks)",4.0,0

I guess that a good deal of torque is applied to the single nut and bolt holding it in place, and it loosens easily, at least when installed without Locktite as my plumber did.  It's almost impossible to get at this nut.  I could feel it in order to hand-tighten it blindly, but I couldn't get it secured.  I thought getting a wrench on it without a special plumber's faucet tool would be impossible.  I was therefore nearly ready to give up and request a service call, that surely would have cost $100, when I saw this product.  It came in 2 days, and my faucet was secured rigidly (pun intended, sorry) in 2.01 days -- a minor miracle from my desperate perspective.
I wish it had multiple inserts for different size nuts because if they're mounted flush, I don't see how it could reach the smaller sizes, as designed with the smaller-sized wrenches nested within and below the largest.  That didn't matter in my case, but it would limit the usefulness somewhat under some circumstances.
Other reviews would lead one to believe that it's too flimsy to be useful, and that's certainly UNtrue.  The construction is plenty strong enough for hand-tightening or loosening, which is all it's designed for and which should almost always be sufficient.  I can see how you might crack or break it if you tried to turn the lower end with a pipe wrench.  The slot, which is the genius-inspired part of this tool, could allow it to deform under that kind of torque, but it's not designed for that use.

"After discovering how harmful rawhide chews, treats, bones etc. I went on a search to find a healthy alternative for my 3 mo. old puppy. I was amazed to find how healthy sweet potato strips and fries were for all dogs as there are no harmful ingredients in them and they contain no other ingredients except sweet potato, period. At first my dog was confused, however offering nothing else but the sweet potato, she quickly decided to give them a try. She takes them to her bed and enjoys them tremendously.

"Reykjavik, Iceland Film Festival, September, 2000.
I was not sure what to expect from this. I am a longtime fan and student of all things Yugoslavian. I had seen Makavejev's comparatively commercial film A Night of Love prior to screening two of his more obscure films, Sweet Movie, which is nothing less than visually frightening and decidedly disturbing, and this, Mysteries of an Organism. With more disturbing visual imagery and borrowings from surreal fantasy, the second half of the film is more like a ""film"" in that it tells a story of a Yugoslav woman, who, like all women portrayed in the film, is very sexually liberated, and claims that this is so because all women have been justly liberated by the revolution and socialism in Yugoslavia. When she meets a visiting Russian figure skater, she realizes that the Soviet ideals of socialism are limiting and lead only to repression of the self. She tries to teach him that love and socialism are not at odds with each other, but are indeed intertwined. When they finally make love, he ends up killing her because his passions and love have been so repressed. The first half of the film, which is a bit excessive and strange, is more documentary in style, but it does illustrate the points that are made more eloquently in the second half of the film by probing the life of a man (whose name i cannot recall) who was demonised by the US government.
The screening in Reykjavik was luckily accompanied by the director himself explaining his ideas and what he hoped to accomplish. This is a fascinating film, a total departure from American, or really, any other films of any genre or nationality.",3.0,0

I have a similarly sized hard anodized professional skillet, but the convenience of a nonstick finish and glass lid was irresistible.

This is a good utility skillet for frying or cooking larger quantities of food. The better-designed Calphalon Contemporary see-through lid sits on the pan just right, and lets you check the progress of your food while sealing in flavor (and trapping aromas). (The less times you open the lid = better and faster cooking.) The silicone cover to the lid handle is a stroke of brilliance.

This pan also comes with an insulated silicone handle cover, which used to be an accessory item. Chalk that up as a value-add.

The story of how 300 years old people are reanimated after being exposed to the sun and the other elements.  The movie is based on the book by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and is based on a novel by the late Robert Burns.

"I collect knives and tried this low priced traditional 'toothpick' from Buck.
Like a number of Bucks knives now, this is made in China, so I'll quickly hit a few potential quality control hot spots:

The jigged bone handle scales: mounted to the frame of the knife with no visible gaps or defects, no problem there. The jigging itself is deep and well defined, not REfined as on a Case knife, but it's low priced (an equivalent Case toothpick would cost you at least 5 times as much.) The bone material seems OK.

The blade: Evenly ground on both sides, came paper-shearing sharp (just shy of hair-shaving.) No defects. Bucks prolific 420HC steel- perfectly decent steel, Buck has a particularly good heat treat in testing. I own the Buck 119 special large fixed blade which uses the same steel.

The bolsters: Nice and glossy, the pins are buffed to near invisibility.

Blade pivot point: The blade snaps open firmly, no play side to side or up and down. It is of course a slip joint blade and does not ""lock.""

Overall, 9/10 for value. A fine choice as a gift, as a light duty every day carry pocket knife, or as a budget ""gentleman's folder"" (I bought it with this latter purpose in mind- it is thin, lightweight, and looks nice.)

When you wheel this carrier around, the straps get caught in the wheels. After wheeling it around for 6 blocks, the straps were literally shredded.

The clasps for the removable shoulder strap is made of VERY cheap plastic, rather than metal so you have to be very careful with it, otherwise the plastic will snap.

"As part of my significant renovation throughout a recently-purchase house, I bought this faucet for my bar sink just two weeks ago.  This faucet was extremely easy to install.  Since I did not have to remove the old faucet (there was no faucet at this sink when I bought the house), it took me all but 10 minutes to have this up and running.  Just put the whole faucet through the sink hole.  Screw in the mounting plate from the below.  Hook up the water supply hoses and you are set.  Please note that I am a fairly typical DIYer not expert, so I think most anybody would be able to install this faucet.

My experience with Amazon has been great.  The box arrived quickly.  Although it is advertised as oil-rubbed bronze, the color is fairly light not as dark as some of the other bronze faucets that I have.  In fact, the picture on Amazon is a lot darker than the actual faucet.  There were also no hoses included with the faucet, so you will need to buy them separately.

However, a chewable contains at most 40 mg of phycocyanin.  The studies of phycocyanin that they list on their website, which were done in Cuba and on Rats, showed a benefit when the rats were given between 100-300 mg per kg.  At 37 lbs, my dog is about 17 kg, which means that she would need 1700-5100 mg of phycocyanin per day to get the same benefit.

One caveat with these, what I call ""Harbor Freight"" meters, is that half of the meter leads are trash. You MUST test the leads. I run 1A through the lead and test the voltage across it with a known good meter. If a lead measures more than .2V at 1A it is unusable. I have seen these leads test as high as .6V at 1A. That is .6 ohm. Many of your readings will be meaningless with leads with that kind of resistance. As for the units themselves, they work quite well. I've only had one fail. The display was quite jumpy for some time. Then the readings started to drift very high before the display just went blank. I avoided these cheap meters for years because I did not think I could get a respectable product for this price, but now this is my go-to meter for when I might leave it behind or lend it out and not get it back. When in doubt go for something with better leads to start with such as the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Uni-T-UT30D-Pocket-size-Digital-Multimeter-with-Square-Wave-Generator-50Hz-Sinometer-OEM/dp/B005TLXNPO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Uni-T UT30D Pocket-size Digital Multimeter with Square Wave Generator (50Hz),Sinometer OEM</a>",5.0,0

I already have Dewalt 20V tools and needed to add a drill.  The chuck on this is very smooth and nice for changing bits.  Tightens down easily with out tearing up your hand.  Compact head fits into many tight areas.  Fairly light weight for a drill.  Power has been very good for drilling metal and wood so far.  It does come with a belt clip but DOES NOT come with a spare bit holder on the other side of the tool.  Some Dewalt tools do come with this and some do not.  This one does not.  The battery life has been excellent so far.  Since I am just a home user I can't really speak to if the brushless is really increasing my run time.  I can say it is lasting a lot longer than my Craftsman 19.2V I replaced (Both had about the same amp hour Li-Ion battery capacity).

"Absorbs odor very well. Switched to it from tidy cats and my cat loves it. One time, I had to switch back to tidy cats for the week (due to poor planning on my part- had to get whatever the gas station had) and my cat very unhappy! She let me know she didn't want to use her box unless it had the precious cat litter in it by leaving me a little ""present"" next to the box when it was the tidy cats litter. So now I stock this stuff religiously and we have no problems. I think she likes that it's unscented and I like that it works so well. I used to buy these 40lb bags via PrimeNow(cat litter to your door in less than 2 hours? Yes please!) but the drivers in my area must have complained about the weight because now they only carry the smaller bag. I wish it was on Prime Subscribe and Save.

My one pet peeve about this product: it's dense meaning from a volume perspective you actually get less. I store the bag in an old (cleaned out) tidy cats pail and that's how I know that one 40lb bag of Precious cat takes up barely slightly more volume as one 24lb pail of Tidy Cats. I'd say 30lbs Precious Cat probably equals 24lbs Tidy Cats. I don't think it's a big deal. The added density is probably why it's less dusty and clumps better than other litter brands. But if you're like me and fill the litter box to a certain volume all the time, it's just something to think about when deciding how much/often to order.",5.0,0

"I was just looking at space heaters and am happy to have this one. The footprint is nice and slim, so the heater can easily be tucked away when not in use. You can rest it directly on the floor or mount it on the wall. I opted for a wall mount and found the included mounting diagram to be helpful in drilling the included brackets. I actually mounted mine sideways and it feels rock solid on the wall. The buttons feel a little tight, and I question their longevity with repeat use, however, they seem to be of nice quality so it should be fine. There's a filter on the back that can be removed for cleaning, but I can tell already it'll be a pain to get to, given the unit is mounted to the wall. As far as heating, the unit feels a little drafty, but that's how these ones are designed. I much prefer the ones that just emanate heat rather than blowing it with a fan.  Overall, this one is nice and seems to be priced right given the quality build.",4.0,0
"We put this in when we renovated our kitchen wanting to have the newest neato tech.  It would work fine for a couple months and then go on the fritz, either not responding at all or randomly turning on when nobody was in the room.  I am pretty handy, I have dissembled, cleaned, and reassembled it several times now but it never lasts for long.  The whole system is based on the fact that when you touch it you ground it out, yet there are numerous components below the sink that are not insulated, and if they happen to touch something conductive (like, oh, I don't know, a PIPE?) it renders it useless or triggers it when nobody is around.  I went through several iterations of mounting the batteries up and away, insulating the pipes to prevent the hose/weight from touching etc all to no avail.  In addition, the soap dispenser that came with it is plastic crap, it's not even metal, just a facade that looks like metal, it broke within a few months.  Delta replaced that part, but still, do you expect a $300+ faucet set to break in 3 months?

"I've used these over the past several years, so have a lot of experience with them.  I switched to them as I couldn't clean the plastic litter boxes completely of odor, and in my small home that's an important consideration.  To boot, I threw away a Litter Robot before settling on these boxes, if that gives a reference point for me using only these.  These are the BOMB - very strong, holds two bags of 18 lb Dr. Elsey's litter at a time (that's how my cats and I like it ;), and the cardboard sides allow the litter to stay drier.  Getting clumps off the walls is easier compared to plastic bins, likely due to the drying effect.  After a month, I bin the entire shebang (one box for two cats lasts an entire month).  I've also used the smaller ones when I travel with my cats.  The boxes are reasonably-priced, and I usually get them from my local Pet Club - but am extremely grateful I can find them for the same price on Amazon with Prime Shipping when my local Pet Club is out of stock.

"This is a perfect example of CGI taking over.  It's obvious someone drew up a storyboard with a dozen action scenes and another dozen tense lines.  There may have been vague intentions to add in credible plot details and character motivations before the actors arrived.  Time apparently ran out.  This Lex Luthor is the weakest villain of all time...just incredibly bland and flat.  The actors are given so little to work with that scenes must be propelled with clenched teeth, furrowed brows, and pained brooding.  None of them seem like they could have possibly had a minute of fun in their whole lives.  The color palette is dreary and limited.  The musical cues are mind numbingly predictable.  The camera angles are never inventive.  Except for a couple of new visuals, it's so much of the same old same old.  That's unforgiveable considering how many actors have now played Bruce Wayne and Clark Kent.

"I really couldn't be happier with this lead. It is nice and long, so we use it tied to a stake in the yard to practice ""come"" and play fetch. I can stay hands-free and, because it's on a stake that sticks out of the ground, it spins around and doesn't get tangled.  The metal clip works great and is nice and strong. It has been totally sturdy for us so far - our puppy has reached the limit of this on numerous occasions, yet it looks and feels good as new.  She has also grabbed it with her teeth any time she trips on it and no bite marks. You can't tell from the pic and I don't recall it saying in the description but, one end has the metal clip and the other end has a loop like a traditional leash - I just put that around our stake (which has it's own loop at the top so it can't come off) and it stays on perfectly. We leave it out in all weather (rain, sun, wind...no snow yet) and it's still great. It is cotton so I don't know if it will break down over time but I wouldn't hesitate to replace it since it's a great price.

It won't be the end of the world as I'll then get to test some of the other shower heads I was looking at before deciding on this one :D.

I'm giving the product 4 stars instead of 5 just because as stated in another review, the design is a waste.  It's a wider spray, which I like, but the curved aspect of it is totally pointless.  They adjusted the nozzles inwards so that despite the curved designed, that would otherwise spray your whole body (making the head pretty awesome), it all just sprays straight like a normal flat head would.  The curved design is aesthetic only, and therefore doesn't make any sense to me.  I think it is wasted potential and somewhat misleading.",4.0,0
"Unlike a lot of other filters, this one lets you use your own media. BUT you may not even need to because unlike other filters, the inserts are super cheap. I got the surface skimmer attachment, it looks a lot nicer than the green intake tube and cleans up film on your tanks surface.

I got this 50 for my 30 gallon salt water. If you are doing salt water you'll want a higher rated capacity filter than what your tank actually is. If I were to buy again I'd go even another size up to the 70 though.",5.0,0

"Update
Now that I have used this tool, I feel confident that it will hold up well.  The other two I had to replace, both with the same plastic handle.  I used this to hold up the smaller drill bits in a bit holder.  This holds the drill bits in the bit holder.  I also like the fact that the plastic handle on the drill bits has a plastic handle on top.  I like the fact that the bit holder is a bit holder so that you can flip the bit holder onto the bit holder.  I'm not sure why I got the big drill bits, but I like the fact that they have a plastic handle.  It's a bit holder that you can flip to a bit holder.  It's a bit holder that you can flip to a bit holder.  It's a bit holder that you can flip to a bit holder.

I'm very happy with the purchase.  I'm going to have to wait until the spring to remove it and use it again.  I have a lot of experience with this tool and I have a lot of experience with the little drill bits and the little bit holder.

I'm glad I got these bits.  I bought them because I wanted a tool that would hold up to the use of a little drill bits in a bit holder.  I didn't need them to hold up, so I just used them.

"Replaced a single pole switch with this product. High ceiling made it difficult to control fan light and speeds. This upgrade was simple to install resulting in a compact and modern look compared to the single switch it replaced. I changed all the switches with Lutron products (i.e., dimmer switches) during this project and couldn't be more happier with this decision.

The fan light and speed selection is responsive, the remote unit was small compared to others I have installed making it easy to place in the canopy.  I placed the remote control unit on the wall at the other end of the room with velcro allowing the fan to be controlled at the two main entrances.

I liked this solution so much, I ordered two more units, but unfortunately not from Amazon, since the price increased from $85 to

"**UPDATED AT THE END**

When we got our new dog, my wife and I decided that we were only going to go with good products that didn't contain any harsh chemicals! After searching around a little, we decided on Cain & Able because I love the smell of Peppermint and Tea Trea is a wondrous plant!

GENERAL
First off, this shampoo smells great out of the bottle! It's not too strong after our puppy is dry, but it really does leave a very nice smell on her. I can't say that the pump is as bad as some people have mentioned, but then again we only have a 21lb dog so we don't have to use all that much on her!

EFFECTIVENESS
We have noticed less itching from our dog, something that has nothing to do with fleas, but according to our vet probably something to do with her diet before we got her (she was a street rescue). She doesn't seem to desire to lick it once she has been washed, but even if she did we feel a lot better knowing that there are no artificial perfumes and chemicals that might be bad for her! We can't comment on the effectiveness of being an insect repellent, but both of the main ingredients are known to be natural repellents and we feel safe knowing she is protected!

WHY 5 STARS??
- Great value for a safe and earth-friendly product
- Smells GREAT!
- Contains no harmful chemicals!

OVERALL
Overall we are very happy with this purchase, and our puppy seems to love it! I highly recommend this product, especially if you care about what seeps into your dog's skin!

**UPDATE 03/2012**
We have been using this shampoo exclusively for over 5 months now, and we are still VERY happy with it! Our dog doesn't itch at all any more and her coat is shiny (a good diet greatly helps this)! We will continue buying this product unless we happen upon anything better!",5.0,0

"This crate is awesome!  It's a great alternative to the hard plastic offered for pets.  I bought two of them, one for each cat.  They have been getting in it on their own.  It has tiny mesh windows that can be covered with the roll down shade and a mesh door that zips.  I wouldn't say that it would be great to carry around all day because it's softer than a plastic carrier, but great to transport.  The bottom sags a little when lifted, but I plan on taking a 16X20 art canvas and slipping it in the bottom to make it more sturdy.

"And with no further adieu, here is what I think about Captain Phillips.

We have a movie that is based on real events, hence being introduced to the titular character Richard(""Rich"" in the movie). Richard Phillips is given the task of taking command of a ship by the name MV Maersk Alabama. And as he aboards the ship things are running ever so smoothly. However, after taking notice of two not-so-familiar boats that are approaching the ship, our Captain finds himself at the very center of a hostage crisis, and from there, we have our movie.

I should start by saying that I did do some research going into the movie; and although there have been reports that this movie itself is not entirely accurate, I loved Captain Phillips. Tom Hanks has had numerous good/great performances; THIS IS one of his greats. From beginning to end, he personifies the role of the Captain turned hostage very well. And though Barkhad Abdi is relatively an unknown actor, he was equally as great in his role as Abduwali Muse. Great acting.

The situation on screen is almost unbearable; many times during the movie I was holding my breath because of the intensity of the scenes and the savagery of the Somalian pirates. They are not clever, but they have guns, and their leader Abduwali has a motive.

If you have not yet seen Captain Phillips, I urge everyone to give this movie a watch. With Outstanding performances and a notably shrill 3rd act, Captain Phillips gets

"George takes his big city bride, Madeline, to meet the family in North Carolina. There's Meg, his mom, who's suspicious of this polished, too thin woman introduced into the family. The brother exudes resentment towards George and slumps sullenly through the film. His wife, girlishly fawns over Madeline, and gushes about her own pregnancy while excusing her sullen husband's churlishness. The father quietly goes about his woodworking and lets the action play out. Along with this family scenario, Madeline seeks out a backwoods artist to sign for her gallery. This creates a conflict when a crisis in the pregnancy draws the family together, while Madeline tends to business. The film is marred by too many scenes with low lighting make the viewer guess what's going on with whom. Additionally many scenes are muttered through and possibly key information gets missed. At first I thought Madeline was the focus of the film, but the other daughter-in-law captures the attention through the majority of the film. Interesting family, but not as satisfying as it could have been.",3.0,0

"This little anime here truly emphasizes the very fact that Japan is quite obsessed with wistful visions of a fantasy-perfect high-school lifestyle completely saturated with glittery magic, action-adventure, and flawless  youth. Quite similar to the famous master of manga, Osmau Tezuka's  ""Knight of Ribbons"" where a young princess dresses up in a male  garb to embark on a soul-searching odyssey, Utena with her cotton  candy-pink hair and sparkling blue eyes dons a boy's school uniform and  dates the other girls at a very swanky academy school where young children  of the mythical land attend. Then Utena meets a very mysterious black girl  with startling green eyes and lavendar curls at a rose-choked greenhouse  where she tends to the colorful flowers. And Utena sees her get slapped  around. So she challenges the tormenter to a duel, which would take place  in the great ivory arena up in the heavens right underneath a floating  inverted castle. And wins. Thus the ""Rose Bride"" quite gratefully  throws herself at Utena's feet - much to her unwillingness to claim her. A  very misty-eyed fantasy tale filled with princely (princessly?) heroism,  chivalric romance, theatrical drama, lots of swashbuckling action, ideal  visions of innocent childhood and adolescent rebellion, and lesbian  suggestions. Quite sweet and fairy-like!",5.0,0

"Let us, gentle reader, ignore this films failure as a sci-fi / religious movie and let us celebrate its triumph as the greatest comedy of all time.
Imagine, for a moment that Jerry Falwel decides to make a film based the book of Job.

Add a soundtrack by The Bloodhound Gang featuring Cher and you begin to get a small idea of the unintentional hilarity that is Battlefield Earth.

"This 2000 Israeli film is as fresh as today's headlines.  Set in a settlement in Israel it's about a radical rabbi and his ardent followers, two best friends who compete for the rabbi's daughter, and the ongoing conflicts of orthodoxy and secularism in Israel.

The film is as bleak as the landscape around the settlement.  And the rabbi's radicalism is the one thing that keeps the young men bound together.  One of them is in the army and creates a religious unit much to the concern of his superiors who distrust the radicalism, even though the soldiers perform well.  Another young man is the scholar and the rabbi wants him to marry his daughter.  Alas, though, she prefers the soldier.  Trouble follows.  She leaves the settlement and goes to the city where she finds an apartment with some other religious young women.

Her rejection of her religious suitor, however, pushes him to plan to commit a radical act and he involves the soldier as well as another innocent friend in the plan.  How this all plays out is scary, as we are all aware of the potential violence of terrorist attacks.  This film brings this all out as well as some complex psychological factors.

The problem was that the story moved a little two slowly for my taste.  Also, as it was a foreign film, I know that it lost a lot in translation.  It seemed as if some parts were missing and the narrative seemed to jump round awkwardly.  So, in spite of its message and the tension raised regarding what would happen next, I found myself looking at the clock and feeling bored.  However, the film had an interesting theme and the acting was excellent.  It also showed me the world through a unique point of view.",4.0,0

"I felt the military was covered well. Occasionally the group fleeing the monster encounter military personal fighting the beast and in their utterances we get an update on what's really going on, the big picture. It was probably unrealistic though, or at least some parts of it were unrealistic. 6 hours after Godzilla drops, M1 tanks (our main battle tank) and even heavier artillery pieces are fighting in Manhattan? Didn't earlier in the movie it show one of the bridges into Manhattan being destroyed? Perhaps it was possible. . .

It was only after the movie was over, thinking about it, that I realized what the movie was about (odd that I give a movie I don't understand 10 stars, but I do - I think my date liked it as much or more than I did).

"Today, almost everyone has heard of Billy Graham, but not everybody knows his early history--or ""the rest of the story"", as Paul Harvey liked to say.  This DVD tells the rest of that story, and it was very interesting.

The narrative begins with Billy Graham as a young man living at his parent's home, and how he came to be called into the ministry.  We also learn about the person he almost married, and the one he did--and how he met her.  We see how one of Billy Graham's very best friends in the ministry lets him down, and then ridicules him publicly.  It is very easy to identify with Billy Graham in the different situations portrayed.

This movie definitely keeps your interest, some parts are funny and some are sad.  Even if Billy Graham were not a public figure, this would be an account worth watching.  Even though there were not any big name actors in this film, it was well done and enjoyable.  I am a long-time admirer of Dr. Graham, and came forward at one of his crusades when I was twelve years old.  Learning Dr. Graham's history made me respect him even more.

The movie is suitable for all ages and clean.  Our family highly recommends this, and gives it five stars.",5.0,0

"By 2001 the resurgence of slasher movies had fortunately died down and audiences were in the mood for something new. Jeepers Creepers is a return to the old-fashioned monster movies in the style of classic Universal. Those were movies built on suspense and atmosphere rather than gore and multiple kills.

Justin Long and Gina Philips play Darry and Trish, a pair of argumentative siblings who are traveling home through the Florida backwaters for spring break. Along the way they are terrorized by an unseen figure driving a ugly truck. Darry sees the figure dumping what appears to be dead bodies into a pipe by an abandoned church. In a moment of agonizing plot contrivance Darry turns around and heads back to find out what's really going on, unawares that he'll give the villain a taste of his fear, thus making him a marked man.

Victor Salva layers the movie with homosexual and incestuous subtext, while keeping the monster in the dark for the most part, building fear and mystery about him. The Creeper is a great villain and Salva builds an intriguing mythology about him.

The swift running time (the credits roll at the 85 minute mark) prevents things from getting deep or expansive but the sequel builds upon this world and is actually a better movie despite the hate. On its own Jeepers Creepers is an effective but superficial. Plenty of points for being original however.

The Blu-ray is in 1.85:1 1080p and it is an improvement on the DVD, however there are just a few too many scenes shot in soft focus which don't give it much of a pop. The black levels are impressive though. It sounds better in DTS HD-MA, and all the extras from the DVD have been ported over.",3.0,0
"I moved into a new house that had been built about a year before.  For the past 17 months I have been changing batteries very often in my three CO detectors.  I finally started putting dates on the batteries and found that they only last 2 months (1 month in a cold basement).  I'm guessing I spent about $70 in batteries.  The batteries are only there to kick in when the AC power fails, which it rarely does and never for very long.  However, my tests indicate that the batteries are being drained while the AC power is properly working.

I contacted the company for warranty replacements and was told I would have to pay $20 for shipping & HANDLING to get my ""FREE"" warranty replacements.  I made a big stink and got them to send them at their expense.  Only time will tell if the replacements work.  Till then I can work on the problem of random beeps from my BRK smoke detectors.

I don't have to babysit him like other interactive puzzles to make sure he doesn't eat and choke on the disconnecting pieces - this he can do alone and give me a few minutes to breathe!  We're raising a very high energy boxer puppy so this is a blessing!  At first Bubba kept kicking it and hitting it with his feet he didn't get it, but after some ""positive praise"" each time he used his tongue instead of his feet he got the idea - now it stays nicely on the floor and he doesn't kick it - he just spends a good 15-30 minutes licking away till he laps up all his kernels! :) Thank you for designing this!",5.0,0

"A mother/son road trip movie is sort of an uncharted journey in the film world. That made this a very unique film from the start.. Based on an actual road trip that Fogelman took with his mother is probably what makes the movie so real. Streisand and Rogen have great chemistry and since the movie is 80% just them, that is a godsend. Joyce's constant need to interfere with Andy's life in almost every aspect drives him crazy until an explosion of unexpected drama on the part of mother and son. There are so many funny lines and situations that the theatre was filled with laughter often. The movie could also take a very serious, moving turn which can move you to tears.
 Streisand has always been an actress of immeasurable range from musicals (Funny Girl) to comedy (What's Up Doc?) to drama (The Way We Were) with each type being a blockbuster hit.  In her semi-retirement she works very seldom.  It took them a year to convince her to come back to her first lead role in many years.  Her Joyce is perhaps one of the most real characters she has ever played  Stripped of glamour she wears track shoes and sneakers.  She is just a regular mother who lives for the happiness of her son.  Rogen has rarely played such a straight character as Andy.  Anne Fletcher has brought out the best of them both.  The climatic showdown is pure real dramatic that Streisand delivers with a powerful punch that stuns the audience as much as Andy.
. I liked everything about this film and can't wait to see it again. Don't skip the end because there are a lot of clips after the credits of mother and son banter that is very funny.

"I bought this in hopes that it would stay lit... after all, it is called ""Windfighter"". I followed the directions exactly. Well, I think they really need to change the name, because it kept blowing out today every time there was a slight breeze. I believe the design is the defect. Even bucket candles stay lit better than this -- the reason being that a bucket candle's wick is much lower. This ""Windfighter"" has a raised wick. And despite the metal top (that keeps falling off when you move or carry it, because it does not screw on or anything), the wind can just blow right through the holes and extinguish the flame. Another issue with this... when it was lit, it was producing some pretty heavy black soot/smoke. YUK! I can still feel it in my lungs! lol  I bought 3 of these, unfortunately, and feel like I wasted money, because I am going back to my old bucket candles that stay lit better and do not make black smoke.",1.0,0

"Up front, these lights are not mellow yellow, they are WHITE. But, it you need a good bright white light in your room, these are the ones you need.

LED's are more expensive on the front end, but the decreased operating costs are supposed to pay for these lights over time. Another factoid that most people do not realize is that the newer ceiling fans with lights will NOT take any bulb over 60w. If you have a three light fan, then that is 180 watts total, two is 120 watts. If the light shade is anything but white the light will be dimmed accordingly. Not knowing that, we initially had two CFL's in the lamp but soon found out that the room was really dark at night. I purchased these two bulbs that are both each equivalent of 100 watt incandescent bulbs and I was surprised how bright they are. The only problem is that the light comes out of the LED bulb somewhat directional due to its design, if you look at it the light bulb design the light bounces out of the white cover on top of the bulb. For a floor lamp or a desk lamp this design would not be a  problem, but since my application requires the lamp to be inserted at a horizontal direction (instead of top to bottom as you would in a table lamp) the light tends to not diffuse through the shade as well as a CFL or an incandescent would, instead it directs the light towards the walls instead of the ceiling. I think that you will get used to the light after a while. Ideally a LED that illuminates at a 360 degree axis like a CFL or incandescent would be better.

The white light is also something to get used to. It is much brighter than the CFL's and incandescents and more appealing especially if you are a reader or have evening low-light sight problems.",4.0,0

"I've installed two of these Panasonic fans and I'm totally sold on them.  The terrible builder quality fans are all dying in my house (six of them) so I've been retrofitting these in their place after foolishly putting in a Home Depot fan that lasted about a year.  I'm a fairly accomplished do-it-yourselfer so that said, here are a couple things to note.

1) You'll be doing some drywall cutting and patching.  I realize some folks say you don't have to patch up drywall but I can't buy that.  The flange of the fan is supposed to sit below the drywall and that requires you to put the fan in from the ceiling side of the drywall (not the attic side).  That means cutting and patching.  For me that wasn't a big deal but if you can't do any drywall patching it may be a problem.

2) The vent on these fans is 4"" in diameter and typical older houses have a 3"" vent so go ahead and buy new ducting when you purchase a fan.

3) The fan instructions tell you to use aluminum flex duct or rigid ducting but I found the plastic collapsible ducting works just fine (my ducts run less than 10' each).

4) If you use a mechanical timer on the fans (like the dial wind up Intermatic timers) the ticking of the timer may be too loud.  Yep, the fan is that quiet.  The loud ticking may bother you and force a switch to an electronic timer.

These fans are expensive.  However, compared to my old fans that sound like a blender full of rocks these Panasonic fans are almost undetectable when they run.  If I were building a house I'd insist on these fans.  They are absolutely worth the money.",5.0,0
"This movie to me was and is amazing. I saw it (rented it) and then bought it so I could watch it over several times. I read a negative review of it (by a professional critic I think) who said the first part was good, well made, but the 2nd part was not. This person missed the whole point.  First she gave the twist in the story so anyone reading the critique would not have this surprise and then she missed a lot of the undertones in the 2nd part. For instance she said ""he meets a young girl who happens to be a butoh dancer and that happens to be what his wife wanted to be"". That says it all, how the person misunderstood the whole story.  In fact the person goes to Japan to find the answer to the death  he cannot accept and in the first part we see his wife at a butoh performance in Berlin, the two parts of the movie tie in exactly. Also there is a clear analysis or how people view and deal with death in the east and the west. The young girl (the butoh dancer in Tokyo) has lost her mother and there is a poignant scene where she compares her mother to a duck (!! up and down, up and down) and gives a very sharp clue as to her mother's death. Also she has been rendered homeless from this death, her situation is quite desperate but in fact she deals with death so much better than our character who is trying to understand his loss from a western point of view.  This movie was a seminal event for me, maybe because I have had some losses in my family and am a dancer but it provoked a terrific surge of creativity , This movie also made me very happy in many ways..and it's beautiful.

"My kitty got a Urinary Tract Infection, and I was really, really worried this could be an ongoing issue, so I purchased this supplement to add to my existing dietary supplement routine. When I put the full amount (1/4 teaspoon) in her food, she turned her little nose up at it and refused to touch it. She was supposed to get the full dose twice a day for two to three weeks before going down to a maintenance dose of 1/4 teaspoon once or twice a week. So, I did the math, and the next day put 1/16 teaspoon (a pinch) in her food, and after a couple of suspicious sniffs, she ate her food without complaint. This equals out to two full doses (1/2 of a teaspoon) every eight days, which is right around the maintenance level. She (and her two brothers) have managed to eat this without issue for several weeks now. She's had a few issues, where I thought perhaps the UTI was recurring, but they were only minor blips, and otherwise, she's been just fine, so I'm very pleased. When used a a preventative, at the maintenance dose, this stuff seems to do the trick! I plan to keep them all on this and am hoping for no further issues.",4.0,0

"It was delightful watching this old film, black and white, bad transfer and all.

Four bad guys are on their way to East Africa to secure a deal with uranium mines. Their agent is Billy (Humphrey Bogart) a man who is a ""typical rare spirit."" His wife is Maria (Gina Lollobrigida). They meet a British couple who are also on their way to Africa. Gina falls for the husband Harry (Edward Underdown) while Harry's wife Gwendolen (Jennifer Jones) falls for Billy. They are stranded in Italy as the boat is in need of repairs and the captain is always full of spirits.

Jennifer Jones steals this film as a fast thinker with an over active imagination who is prone to lying in every situation. The dialouge, in part written by Truman Capote, reflects national stereotypes that translate into today's world as well as clever oxymorons, mispronounced words and misused phrases. It is film in which you want to pay close attention to the words. The bad guys are quite the lot. Peter Lorre plays Julius O'Hara, claiming ""There are a lot of German O'Hara's from Chile."" Maj. Jack Ross (Ivor Barnard) spouts off his love for Hitler and Mussolini along with wild conspiracy ideas. Would make for a wicked remake.",5.0,0

"Tony Randall stars in WILL SUCCESS SPOIL ROCK HUNTER? opposite Jayne Mansfield. With her hair bleached as white as a Magistrate's wig, Jayne seems a poor Marilyn Monroe caricature whose tendencies to squeak, prance and bubble can be downright annoying.

Example-- Ad man Rock brags about his new business venture: ""That's right Sweetie, I'm president of Rita Marlowe Productions, Inc., but Miss Marlowe is the titular head."" The 'T' word brings a loud squeal from Mansfield that sounds like a bus trying to slow down with no brake pads.

The story opens with great promise-- a demonstration of both Cinemascope and stereo sound. Tony Randall (as himself) stands at extreme stage left and identifies ""the movie you are about to see"" as  THE GIRL CAN'T HELP IT (1956) (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/VHS/dp/B000006GF0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">VHS</a>&nbsp;(<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/DVD/dp/B00115A4QS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">DVD</a>), a previous Jayne effort that starred Tom Ewell. He appeared in '55 with the superior Monroe in another FOX feature, THE SEVEN YEAR ITCH]]  (&nbsp;(<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/VHS/dp/6302484405/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">VHS</a>)  (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/DVD/dp/B000JF5TXO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">DVD</a>).

Although Tony is quite good, better in fact than Ewell opposite Monroe, he just can't carry the load with Jayne and her incoherent boyfriend Mickey Hargitay weighing him down. There are however lots of clever bits here: simulated commercial clips, a calypso song and enough bustle and even chaos to hold your attention.

Which means we're left with a cast of really bad actors running around in their bathing suits and what not, and even with some innovative methods of offing the victims, THE GREENSKEEPER breaks no new ground in the art of film-making.  There are, however, some priceless lines:  having three of the boytoys named Chad, Chet and Chuck (or something like that); when one of the bimbos has to cancel her vacation because the island is being taken over by guerillas, she innocently says ""I didn't even know they had a zoo.""

"Because this movie was made by Baz Luhrmann (Moulin Rouge, Australia, Romeo+Juliet), I had high expectations. And a lot of those expectations were met: beautiful cinematography, a good amount of music, a nice tragic love story, over-the-top but well-done drama. Unfortunately though, it got pretty slow towards the end, and the music wasn't nearly as integrated as it could (and I think should) have been.  I'm not sure an entire song was ever played through, and it wasn't nearly as important to the plot of the movie as it was, for example, in Moulin Rouge. I was disappointed.

"REVIEW OF:  TCP RLP381430WL 14W LED PAR38 40 DEGREE WET LOCATION RATED SPOT LIGHT BULB, WARM WHITE

This efficient bulb casts a nice bright light-Brightens the entire front of the house for added safety. This Light bulb's standard-sized base screwed in immediately to existing socket.

This indoor/outdoor LED light bulb exceeded expecations. Over the years energy saving bulbs have gotten better, but many still seem kind of dull and gloomy. Oftentimes, the bluish light just hurts your eyes.  How often have you consoled yourself with the thought that by compromising a nice light you are saving energy and money?  No longer.

This bulb is doing a great job of providing the outdoor porch with a nice warm, yet bright light. No creepy shadows where miscreants can hide!

A heavy bulb, it measures 5.2"" x 5.8"" x 5.9"".  It is rated to use 14 watts of energy, and at 1050 lumens it is theoretically equivalent to a incandescent 90 watt  bulb. This light bulb is fixed at that wattage and does not dim. One can expect this bulb to last about 25,000
hours.  Roughly that's about 5.7 years, assuming 12 hours of darkness a night (25,000/12/365=5.7 years.). Well, that'd be great and at $19.80 /bulb would give you outdoor weatherproof light for less than $3.50 a year.

The bulb should work well in most areas as it is rated to function at  temperatures ranging from  -4 to 104 degrees Fahrenheit.

Security is increased with brightly lit areas....................

I'd like to thank Amazon for the opportunity to review this indoor/outdoor LED light bulb that I received as a complimentary sample in exchange for this honest review.

I hope my review is helpful for you! Thanks for your time.",5.0,0
"This is an excellent head lamp, Vitchelo has out done themselves. A little warning to any potential buyers of the Vitchelo V600 Plus. This doesn't work the same as the regular V600. The up side of this fact; this is the first headlamp flashlight with a dimming feature. I highly recommend reading, and understanding the directions for these headlamps by Vitchelo.
  Shipping was very prompt, only two days. The headlamp comes in a nifty leather pouch, another first for a headlamp. And the batteries provided are Duracell Copper Top. Not some cheap off brand batteries, often provided in new flashlights.
  In the purchase of my last Vitchelo head lamp, I wasn't sure how water, and weather proof this product achieves. I'm happy to say; the Vtchelo
V 600 exceeded my expectations in keeping out all water. My Vitchelo V600 is also very rugged. After 6 months of being strapped to my hard hat, as I work on all sorts of cranes. My V600 has taken many hard bumps; I've onIy replaced the batteries twice, and my quality head lamp keeps working and working. I'm very impressed with the Vitchelo product line. I know this same standard of quality will carry over into my Vitchelo V600 Plus.

My cats have a misguided sense of smell. I've tried a lot of different foods and they will all tell you about the difference. My cats are not the same as other cat owners. They are in a phase of being lazy. This is a great food for them and a great place to look out for them. I have tried several different brands and none of them were great. I highly recommend this food. I have a 60lb terrier mix and this is his favorite food. My dog absolutely loves this bed. She loves to sit on it and it's a great size. It fits nicely in her crate and she's not afraid of anything. It's a nice small bed for her to sleep on.,3.0,1

"Any drummer who wants to learn great technique or merely enjoy great drumming will appreciate this video. It showcases Buddy's technique across a full spectrum of sets, including brushwork on ""Brushstokes"".

One of the highlights of this DVD is a bonus sequence of ""Green Dolphin Street"" (from 1972) that has one of Buddy's classic solos.  This sequence alone makes the DVD worth getting. An added bonus is the included soundtrack on CD that comes with the DVD.

For the drummer wanting to learn a few tricks this is one of the best viedos of Buddy because there is ample camera exposure on his playing.  It's one thing to listen, but when you can see and listen it's a powerful combination for learning technique - and this video does just that.

Tracks include Hookin' It, Brush Strokes, If They Could See Me Now, Good News, West Side Story Medley, Carioca, Time Check, Green Dolphin Street.

If you are a Buddy Rich fan I also recommend getting the CD ""Buddy Rich Collection"" ASIN B00000DB1H, which is a remake of a 2-record set circa 1971.",5.0,0

"Guillermo del Toro's masterpiece depicting yet another episodic take on the seemingly never-ending conflict between Good and Evil...

Combining a pristine and innocent imagination with the heart and soul of a poet, the young heroine Ofelia is seemingly over-matched against the consummate evil of Fascism that has possessed Franco's Spain.  Unable to match their firepower, Ofelia turns to imagination and magic instead.  Del Torro leaves it to the discretionary viewer to decide where fantasy ends and magical reality begins.

Within the magical fantastic occurrences between Ofelia and her fantasy/magical beings are contained lessons in life given to the all-too-human Ofelia.  They provide not only a means of escape but of real life survival, which strongly argues for more than the products of a young but gifted girl's prodigious imagination.

A great and timely movie that deserves all the attention it has received.",5.0,0

"Guy (Jason Bateman) is forty years old and an underachieving genius. We discover his mother moved around a lot to escape evictions.

Guy is rude to just about everyone, especially his fellow contestants with whom he plays mind games. He makes friends with a ten year kid of Indian heritage (Rohan Chand) and indulges him in vices. The reason why he entered the contest was a bit lame, but we needed something for the film.

"LED lamps are everywhere and they just continue to improve. My favorite feature of this lamp is the true warm white color. Many LED lamps have a reddish cast to them, but this one has the proper mix of color that avoids that. Output-wise, The 3 levels of light are comparable to other bulbs and of course the much lower energy requirement lets you leave this on without worry. It's pretty much instant-on, with the tiny delay which is an LED norm - they have electronics so the bulbs are really ""powering up"" when you turn them on. It's negligible but deserves mention if you haven't used LED bulbs yet.

The product description is a little strange - ""LED Incandescent"" - it's LED, not incandescent. It's also non-dimmable per the packaging.",5.0,0

"I was puzzled to see why this only has four stars, since mine is beautiful and works great. I did have to unscrew it when I first got it because the battery had come loose and was rolling around in the lamp, but I simply stuck it back into place and the lamp works fine. The colors are vibrant and really pop both during the day and when it's lit up at night. And the light is actually a rather bright white, which is emitted from a small stalk of three tiny LED lights gathered into a bunch at the bottom, like grapes. The stake leaves a little something to be desired, though, since it was a little difficult to put together (I had to take the screw out of the pole and then re-insert it, since it was in crooked) and it's not the sturdiest while in the ground. The stake itself is fine enough, but the pole is so narrow that it can't really support the weight of the lantern, which causes the lamp to easily swivel around. But once it's in place, it's fine. I have it next to my walkway to add curb appeal to the front yard, and it looks really pretty both during the day and at night. I was debating getting a second one simply for better symmetry, but the one lantern as it is looks perfectly fine, even charming by itself.",5.0,0

This particular unit has a 7 gallon capacity, a glass-lined tank, and a recovery rate of almost 7 gallons per hour.

In my review video I cover the main features and issues with this water heater, but briefly:

This 7-gallon heater is large! The dimensions are 17.5 W x 17.5 H x 14.5 D. This was too large to install in our bathrooms or kitchen, so we had to install this in our basement crawlspace.

Also keep in mind that the unit itself weighs about 30 pounds, and with the extra weight of 7 gallons of water, the total weight of the heater will be almost 90 pounds. We set the heater on cement blocks to make a firm foundation.

Hooking up the plumbing to the unit is relatively straightforward, though in our case, because we installed the unit in our basement, we had to tap into the hot water run.  But this location would also not cause any house damage if the unit leaked.

Hooking up the electricity was more difficult, since we had to hire an electrician to make a hard-wired 12A and 120V connection the heater needs.

We are happy with this unit. The time it takes to get hot water is much shorter than it used to be, and seven gallons is enough of a reserve that we don't deplete it before our main hot water heater kicks in.

So all in all we have been very happy with this Bosch water heater, though again keep in mind the size and weight limitations of the 7-gallon unit.

I hope this review has been helpful!",5.0,0

"Review of Secondhand Lions
Hot Toasty Rag, November 29, 2017

Usually, in this formula of coming-of-age films, its a troubled young girl who gets sent to her grandmothers house, ultimately learns the errors of her ways, and becomes a better person. In Secondhand Lions, Haley Joel Osment gets sent to his great-uncles farm. This type of squeaky-clean, goody-goody story is usually watched by women, which is why they usually star women. The added testosterone of three men in the lead roles made the film feel a little strange. Tim McCanliess script tried to add a masculine plot line about finding a hidden stash of gold, but it was a storyline that didn't really appeal to women. All in all, the film doesnt really work.

Michael Caine and Robert Duvall play Haleys great-uncles, and the real problem with the film is spoken by the latters character. He says, in teaching a life lesson to his nephew, that he believes all people are genuinely good. The reason this line of dialogue doesnt resonate is the same reason the rest of the film doesnt work: its not speaking to the right audience. If a grandmother character said that line to her granddaughter, the women in the audience would feel warm and fuzzy inside and the movie would have been a hit. Women, especially in this genre of films, have a special close-knit circle of girl power that would make that line believable. Men face disappointments as soon as they are old enough to chase after their dreams; they live through daily struggles, internal frustrations, and never-ending regrets. I cant imagine a man of Robert Duvalls age truly believing that all people are good.",2.0,0

Our Border Collie/ Australian Shepherd mix expends tons of energy running around pushing it all around the yard like crazy, frequently changing directions. Some days it is actually her primary form of exercise, she loves it so much.

"If you want the convenience of buying puppy training pads in bulk and want a great price this is a great choice. These Wee Wee brand pads are by Four Paws, the same company that makes the better quality pads sold at Petco and the other big box stores.

These pads are 22""X23"" with a thick absorbent top layer and a blue plastic bottom layer. They are very absorbant and offer ""odor control"". They work very well.

Entirely Pets takes a long time to ship. They claim that their low product price requires them to cut costs on shipping. I did not anticipate waiting almost two weeks and ran out of pads.

I purchased a small supply of what I thought was the exact same Four Paws product at Petco and noticed that in addition to being much more expensive, the pads were ""improved"". They were quilted and more absorbent. I don't know if Petco is selling a newer version of the product and Entirely Pets is selling out old inventory at an excellent price or if Entirely Pets is just selling a cheaper and lesser quality version.

In my experience, the difference in quality really doesn't matter. The cheaper pads work well enough. They don't leak. They protect the floor and provide the dog with a safe place to go should the need arise.

What does matter is the price and the convenience of buying in bulk. These pads are quite satisfactory.",4.0,0

"I'd never seen this movie and barely even remembered the title, so as I saw some great reviews I was interested to see what I'd missed. And it wasn't much.

This isn't a bad film (though there is some bad stuff in it) but it just doesn't bring anything new to the genre. It's a revenge flick. Jack Elam, Struther Martin and Ernest Borgnine play outlaw brothers who are inept bank robbers. While being chased by Federales after a bungled bank job they happen upon a ranch where they figure to steal fresh horses. They end up killing the owner and raping his wife, played by Raquel Welch. She comes to, buries her husband and swears revenge.

She meets up with Robert Culp, a bounty hunter, and wants him to teach her the way of the gun. He does, reluctantly, and tries to let her know that it's a bad path she's traveling down.

All of this is OK but it's so middle of the road. We've seen it before many times and seen it better. It's directed OK, it's acted OK (accept for Ernest Borgine who is so terrible you wonder how he ever won an Oscar), it's shot OK, the music is OK. It's just OK.

The 3 Stooges routine between the brothers gets tired fast and, as best I could tell, there is absolutely no reason for the mysterious stranger. The kill scenes aren't particularly clever or exciting, and not that much really happens. The way I see it the only reason for making this film was to put a woman in the revenge seat in general and have her played by Raquel Welch in particular, and she just doesn't have the chops to pull it off.

This is an oddity at best. If you're into that sort of thing then have at it. If not......skip it.",3.0,0

"Holy COW!  IT WORKS!!!  Nothing sticks to Tarps, EVER, and it never ever lasts, but someone made a deal for their soul and behold!  We have TARP TAPE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Truthfully, here is my story.

I like Burning Man because the climate tries to kill you (and other reasons.)  A HUGE, CRAZY STORM CAME AND FILLETED MY SHELTER!!  It struck from three directions and damaged every single tent in its vicinity, toppled pop-up campers and shredded the mylar off the tarp base in my roof.  It knocked over entire rows of porta-potties and left me sleeping in my car for days because it filled my shelter with mud and the roof (a tarp) was split.

My conundrum was severe.  The restoration was going to have to happen, should I ever not sleep in my car again, and so I evaluated the tarp tape and hoped it would do the job.  I did a sloppy job of cleaning off the surfaces and I started reattaching the mylar to the tarp with the tarp tape.  I used sutures and long stretches of tape to repair the splits and make the roof look like a relative of Frankenstein.  I didn't think it would last one day, but it survived for two weeks in the desert, through another rain storm and many hot days.  It didn't peel.  It didn't bubble up under the sun or slide like some tapes will when they overheat.  It just held strong.

"Two big stars in so so film. Barbara stanwyck did some of the great films in hollywood from double indemnity to sorry wrong number,but this is not one of them. As an actress she has the ability to display criminal types and states of viciousness and depravity that traditionally males display and she is very believable. Thye problem is not only that it is a screwball comedy,and proceeds in a kind of unrealistic vein,but it does that,since all comedies have to have a bit of realism to it...anyways the movie is about a rich couple in which a man is jealous of his doctor wife seeing other male patients. The drama here though does not center around the female stanwyck being in a dominant role and subjecting or ordering the man about,she is all too nice and respectable in this film,almost angelic like. The movie dramatises more the scientific type displayed by the doctor as opposed to the male childish type character,one of emotionalism,a mental problem, a type wanting to exterminate.he's like murder inc(an old word for organized crime),insane asylum,gestapo...and the word 'peek a boo' meaning a child like mind...and that's really where the comedy in this film centers around and at films end we have the male character trying to open up to the
outside world,be more realistic and find a job,and thats when his relationship is saved and he emotionally matures,and she quits her medical practice and joins him in his new life. Really a spoof and its ok since the
stars breathe life in film,and its a very learned and has some intelligent ideas and they are played for laughs...but the characters change all too easily and picture perfect like to make it believable...but a fun film about the emotionalist child like mind and the scientific here occupying opposite genders...",3.0,0

"`Intacto', the Spanish language film directed by Juan Carlos Fresnadillo is an ingenious take on an idea seemingly borrowed from `The Deer Hunter', with a bit of subtle sci-fi theming worthy of Rod Serling's `The Twilight Zone'. The impact of the supernatural theme is made convincing by the appearance of the great Max Von Sydow in an important supporting role. His appearance in all those spooky early Ingemar Bergman movies makes his character all that more credible.

The story is a bit thin. All the interest in the movie revolves around the characters' participation in highly dangerous, some even fatal games of chance, much like the Russian roulette theme from `The Deer Hunter'. While the attraction in `The Deer Hunter' is purely an addiction to the thrill of the risk, the attraction is both more subtle and stronger in `Intacto'.

I'm a big fan of the director's commentary on movies like this, but I found the commentary just a bit thin here. It did very little to explain the basic premise, it's development, or its origins.

The movie is not as deep or as emotionally involving as Bergman's `The Magician' or `The Virgin Spring' or Fellini's `La Dolce Vita'. The characters are thrill seekers with little depth, but the subtly supernatural premise and the way the story is told makes the trip interesting.",4.0,0

This is a series of Jason Martel's lectures that he is just doing a recorded presentation of.  He has a picture in picture of himself talking to you in the lower part of the screen.

More often than not he is staring/talking at his computer screen highlighting parts of the imagery with his mouse instead of the audience.  This could have just had him narrating without the video of him.  I would assume the rest of the DVD series is more of the same.

"Poor, misguided, drunken Superhero Hancock, seems to have lost his way along with his memory. Lonely and destroying more than he seems to save, not caring what anyone thinks or how they view his escapades, Hancock drinks, curses and half-heartedly saves those in danger.  Among those he saves is Ray, an advertising and marketing guy, who attempts to change Hancock's image so that the world will value him as a ""true"" hero.  With new purpose, a new attitude, and a new outfit, Hancock finds the answers to a lot of questions that he has been searching for (including who and what he is), from an unlikely and surprising source (another of his kind).

While some may not like the ending, if you really think about it, what other outcome could there be, where everyone would be happy? Those who are immortal and will live forever will eventually have the ending that we all want, it will just take patience.  The peace and calm that Hancock finds shows us his true spirit.  After all, what is waiting another few years to find complete happiness, for someone who waited 80 years to discover the truth about who he is?",4.0,0

"first, packaging was TERRIBLE. i know it's a large item, but it was put in two boxes (side to side) and taped with clear packaging tape. just for that they should get 2 stars. a kid would be able to package it better. just terrible.

- the edges always seem to have more paint left over than the middle. not sure if it's my roller or the design
- why is there a trough at the top? what's it for? maybe the brush, but i don't use it.
- holds a lot, easy to apply paint on the roller
- no liner available (that i know of), so it's a pain to clean up (see tip below)

one tip - leave more than a THIN film of paint when you are done, so that when it dries out, you can just peel it off in one swoop. if you try to get every last bit of paint, it's almost impossible to clean the next day (without water or solvents of course). when you don't see the green plastic and it dries out, it will be a piece of cake to take the latex paint off.

"This is a great lamp with clean simple lines and an attractive brushed steel finish. What I like best is how it's totally stable yet has a very small footprint. The flat base is heavy and totally sturdy and only about a third of an inch thick. Since other objects on your desk or bedside table can sit on the flat base or the base can slip under other things, it effectively takes up almost no space. I got one of these for my bedside table four or five years ago and like it so much I just bought two more. The small ""handle"" (short bar) attached to the head is the only thing about it that strikes me as potentially at all flimsy, and it's not really necessary. I can adjust the angle of the neck easily with one hand. Most of the time the 25watt is plenty bright and I don't need 50watt very often. I'd prefer a switch I can push on-and-off on the lamp itself to the wheel switch that's attached partway down the power cord, but it's not a big deal. A switch on the base or the arm would require them to be thicker and spoil the simple design, so I keep the five stars. I got this lamp after I was disappointed with several cheaper (potentially dangerous) halogen desk lamps bought at local stores and swore I'd never buy a cheap one again. You can find halogen desk lamps that are a lot cheaper and you can find ones that are a lot more expensive, but I haven't seen one yet that's a better value for the price.",5.0,0

"There is really only one reason to watch an Andy Warhol production of a Paul Morrissey film starring Joe Dallesandro--and that is the hope that, somewhere along the way, you are going to see Dallesandro naked. A military brat who ran wild, Dallesandro did a number of nude modeling jobs for ""physique"" magazines before he stumbled into Warhol in 1967. Warhol knew a good thing when he saw it, and for the next several years Dallesandro would appear in one Warhol produced film after another, most of them directed by Paul Morrissey. The trouble is that Warhol was a bad producer, Morrissey was a ho-hum director, and Dallesandro is one of the most wooden actors to grace the screen. But whether he's naked, in a three piece suit, or stomping around in a swim suit--well, he just looks so damn good you can't help but watch his every move. Released in 1972, HEAT has the barest plot imagineable. Dallesandro is a former child television star who wanders into a cheap motel that includes a swimming pool, a grotesque landlady, a couple of brothers who do a nightclub act in which they have sex, and a nitwit woman who claims to be a lesbian and whose mother (Sylvia Miles) is a fading star. Pretty soon Dallesandro is getting naked with the landlady and ultimately he gets naked with the fading star--but when she becomes too possessive he walks out. Throw in the occasional reference to SUNSET BLVD and that's pretty much it. The cinematography is dull and so is most of the cast. Miles is loud and shrewish, but she gives the film what little energy it has. Dallesandro, of course, adds his part to the film by looking drop-dead, rough-trade gorgeous. But unless you're hot to see Miles' sagging breasts or Dallesandro's butt and a quick crotch flash, you might want to give HEAT a miss.",2.0,0

The DVD does give you a choice of bleep and unbleep so for those like myself and my family we enjoy the uncensored version of all his specials. Which of course fully uncensored specials is five out of seven specials which I now own this one.  I normally do give away any spoilers about DVD'S but those with families, the unbleep version has walter dropping alot of F words on stage during the preformance.

"So here is how this device operates.

The controls: If you look at the picture you will see there is a lever on the side of the body, and the main pressure switch is on the sloped part in the back. The battery loads via threading off the front lens, and a small twist there disconnects the battery for storage or whatever. The main switch has 2 modes. As shown with the white circle showing the main switch has two functions; if you tap it quickly, the light stays on until you press again. If you hold for any time at all, maybe about 1/2 a second or longer, the light assumes you want a momentary function and will then switch off when you release it.

If you rotate the switch to the other position, the light is momentary only. The switch is easy to manipulate but does not seem to be prone to accidental movement at all.

There's also a little loop that you can push up to protect the main switch.

The mount: The rail mount needs probably a 3 groove section at least, but ideally you would have 5 grooves or so. It's a hinged clamp that's spring loaded closed and also has a thumbscrew to 'lock' the clamp onto the rail.

Basically every aspect of this thing is well thought out, simple, and functional.

"Over a year ago, I bought a B&D 20V Max drill/driver, which has become indispensable. The 20V battery pack seems to last ""forever.""  Based on this experience, I set about replacing my old Sears 19.8V tool set with Black & Decker 20V Max tools. (The Sears batteries were no longer capable of retaining a charge long enough to be useful.)  The BDCCS20B circular saw is a new addition to the 20V Max family.  It serves me well for trimming shelves and various projects around the house.  And unlike the old circular saw, I don't have to stop every half hour to replace the battery pack. My new 20V Max tool set also includes the recip saw (also reviewed) and the edger/trimmer.  I will continue to rely on Black & Decker for more 20V Max tools!",5.0,0

"Vigilante Force has a hilarious moment where a character tells another character that they can't have a Vigilante Force on their hands to deal with the corrupt cops in the town. The character turns around played by Jan Michael Vincent says, ""you already do."" It's hilarious. It's delivered with the straightest of faces that Jan Michael can deliver and it's got an endearing Keanu Reeves quality to it.

The movie's basic premise is that Jan Michael lives in a blue collar town that's completely out of control. He goes and get's a guy to come be a deputy and clean up the town. Only,, the guy turns out to be just as evil as the guys he's cleaning up. Hence, they might need a vigilante force.

Everyone in the movie is good. Kristofferson is great as always. He's a likable villain who charms his way into his position to take over the town. Jan Michael is the sort of guy you're surprised didn't play Captain America in the 70s. He looks like a piece of by-gone Americana. The actresses are randomly Bernadette Peters and Victoria Principal. Both of them are young or youngish and look like the sort of girls you could find ruling as queen bees on opposite sides of the track in a small town. The rest of the cast is great characters actors from TV and movies from back then.

It's not a genius movie. It's a trashy action movie that has some bonkers moments like a marching band member with a rocket launcher. It's also only 89 minutes. It's the best way for a movie like this to go. In and out fast. It never outstays it's welcome. It shows up with a good smile and sends you on your way.",4.0,0

"The vast majority of international terrorism conducted on a spectacular scale is State-sponsored. A faction or network of government uses its access to the levers of power to promote actions in various ways. As withe the Red Brigades the Baader-Meinhof faction showed their gullibility because both groups were created by and controlled by NATO intelligence. Thus terrorism in the modern era is the means by which oligarchies wage secretwars against peoplewhich it would be politically impossible to wage openly. In Germany, Detlev Karsten Rohwedder was the cheif of thr Trusteeship Agency which in 1991 was the largest corporation in the world. In the communist German Democratic Republic(GDR) collapsed in 1989, all industry that was property of the state & was transferred to the Trusteeship Agency. Rohweeder, as the haed of this entity, preferred to keep the vast state property of the GDR as a state sector to maintain existing levels of employment and production so as to facilitate the absorbtion of the East German regions into a unified Germany. Anglo-American financiers wanted all the GDR state property to be put on the auction block at once, so that it could be sold off at bargain basement prices to Wall Street & the City of London. When Rohwedder proved reluctant to accept this policy he was assinated by elements claiming to be the Baader-Meinhof group. Rohwedder's successor immediately began selling off GDR state property the way the City of London/Anglo Americans wanted. Two other celebrated signature cases are the elimation of Enrico Mattei, the president of the Italian state oil company and the German banker Juergen Ponto by the Baader-Meinhof gang  protrayed well in this movie. It is evident that the Baader-Meinhof was acting asa false-flag operation for CIA and MI-6. Putting this as a backdrop the the film increases its importance significantly and allows the viewer to connect the missing dots.",5.0,0

"Installation should be a fairly easy matter if you are replacing compatible hardware.
BUT, if you're replacing Weiser deadbolts, you may be out of luck.
That's what I discovered when I tried to install the Kwikset Smartcode 915 on our front door. I struggled mightily for a couple of hours trying to figure out what I was doing wrong before I finally concluded that when the contractor who built my house installed the Weiser deadbolts, it involved drilling a hole for the latch mechanism just a smidge too low to match up with the Kwikset hardware. It's close, maddeningly close, but there is no way I could make it work.
Just to be sure, I attempted to install the Kwikset deadbolt on a similar door connecting our back hallway with the garage. And the result was exactly the same.
If I want to use the Kwikset hardware, I'll have to enlarge one of the two holes in the door - the one for the latch or the one for the locking mechanism. Or, I suppose, I could buy a new door and start from scratch. None of these options seem worth the effort.
Other than the fact that I can't readily install it, this is a very cool product and I was looking forward to having it on my front door.

"Yeah, I'm pretty sure the 16 movie version is not legit.  The DVD menus are just a still image.  There is absolutely no copy write information on anything or any warnings...

I noticed the audio cutting in and out and switching from 5.1 or stereo while watching it, this only happened a few times.  The quality seems to be normal for dvd's.  Keep in mind that everything will look fuzzy on a large HD tv, but that is normal.

That said, I got this for like 30 bucks, and that is an amazing deal considering that these movies are sooo ridiculously overpriced individually.  The Blu Ray version of these movies go for 30-40+ dollars a piece, which is total BS in my opinion.  I definitely recommend this, but don't spend 1 or 200 bucks on this like some people are saying, there are plenty of 30ish dollar copies out there if you look.

"Normally I have good luck with my purchases. I generally do my research and buy well made products. I bought one of these units and used it successfully for six months. During that time it kept my tropical aquarium at a solid 78F.

One morning, I went to feed my fish and the water was much warmer than normal. I checked the thermometer and it read 90F, luckily my fish were all still alive. I turned the heater knob down to 70 and allowed the water to cool down on its own. After several hours it held 82. I hadn't done a water change in nearly a week so it's not that I let the water level drop.

No big deal, these things happen. Luckily these heaters have a lifetime warranty. I contacted Aqueon by email and received no response. I sent another one a week later, and no response. I couldn't find a phone number for them.

Look, sometimes heaters malfunction. A manufacturer can do all they can to prevent it and back it up with a guarantee. But if they don't stand by their own guarantee or even answer your emails, it isn't a crap product; it's a crap company.

If you are going to buy an Aqueon heater, I recommend the Aqueon Pro instead of this one. They are better units in my experience. Otherwise, have a look at the Eheim Jager, or Fluval offerings.",3.0,0

"The pros: These snubbers are easy to install; and so far, have helped our 25' 3000# pontoon boat NOT yank the tie-up posts out of the lakebed.  We live on a large inland lake and can get waves to 2' - that combined with stiff winds has caused the boat to break the snaps on the end of the tie-up ropes. We've had no problems since installing these; I'm very happy with the performance and would certainly buy these again (they cost a lot less than those sold at our local boating store).  The million-dollar question is ""how long will these last""?  Can't answer that yet - but after 3 months, they still look unaffected by the weather and sun.

The cons are minor: what WAS a nice bright yellow is now more like orange.

I'm sure the same goes for females with the male actors.  I can handle the occasional ""chick flick"", but this one just had a bad story with annoying characters.  Ashton Kutcher and Jamie Foxxx are really lame in this movie, as are most of the characters and situations that are squeezed in to give all the stars enough face time.  I thought it was interesting to see Julia Roberts in an army uniform, never thought I would see that.  The movie doesn't even really end with that much of a ""feel good"" ending.

"Director Joe Johnston's fantastic love letter to the Universal classic also serves as a tribute to the legendary Gothic Hammer horror films of the 1950's & 1970's. For anyone that's a fan of this particular genre of movie will agree that it's about time that this franchise got its definitive story adapted for the big screen. And now armed with a proper budget & a star studded cast, The Wolfman really deserves no less. This ambitious movie share's a visceral mix of avant-garde elegance with Gothic horror, & suspense that sometimes accomplishes all of these goals in just one scene alone. So really this is a long awaited & real accomplishment in sophisticated horror cinema. Unfortunately the downside to the dvd release is that there's no behind the scenes special or ""making of"" documentary outside of the basic deleted scenes. Other than that it's one of the best films of 2010.",5.0,0

The woman is shown to be a young woman who is trying to get a job and she is not able to find a job.  As the story goes, the woman has a dream.

RUN AWAY and yell at everyone else because they didn't save him! The special effects are sub-par, but I kind of expected that. There were a few major errors that would have been cheap and made things look more realistic, but they producers were obviously too lazy to figure out. For instance Henry kills a zombie with a chainsaw, then right after he stands there holding the chainsaw and you can clearly see THERE IS NO CHAIN on it! How hard would have been to use a fake prop chain or put a chain on after the ""kill"".

"Hell Town, 1937 film

It starts with a cattle drive of Herefords (not the longhorn cattle of the mid-19th century). Men ride up shooting pistols to turn the herd. Horses are also driven. Three men make a stand by trees. The rustlers drive off the cattle. In town there is action at ""The Casino"". Tom gives $100 to his cousin and his friend, but this is refused. Bart Hammond owns the saloon and talks to his associates. He talks to two men and offers them a job as cooks. A rattlesnake causes a horse to run off until Miss Judy is rescued. Cattle will be driven to the railroad by Dave. Will the rustlers try again? Yes, when there are only two guards.

The cattle arrive in town to be loaded on the railroad for shipment. The cowboys want to celebrate in town. Will Dave play poker? The waiter switches a deck of cards! This lets the professional player win. [A lesson for the audience.] Tom explains his actions to Miss Judy. In town Tom sits in at the poker game and discovers the cold deck! There is a shot, Tom rides off with the money. The gamblers chase them. Will help come in time? Yes. Dave and his partner return to Montana.

"This is a very powerful movie. I have never been a big fan of Jim Carrey, but in this movie he is great and plays the character with much sensitivity apart from humor. Apparently the movie was never a big success in the US, which could be because the subject is too close for comfort.

It brings to mind the story by Gurdjieff of the evil magician, as the movie shows how Truman is really not in control of anything, as it is all orchestrated from above. Just like we like to think we are at the top of the food chain and in control of our lives, so too does Truman believe that he makes real choices and that he is free. Little does he know that he is lives in a ""cage"". To keep Truman from discovering the Truth, the ""media"" is employed to constantly shape his opinions and to suppress any questioning of the reality in which he lives. This has scary parallels to todays world, where the mainstream media and manufactured opinion polls acts like the ancient Greek chorus in shaping public opinion the way the controllers wish it to be.

So definitely a top movie, that won't disappoint. It is a wake-up call to question one's own reality and to whether one is just a machine playing out a script written by someone else.",5.0,0

"I have attempted to use a bark collar 3 times and sent them all back for various reasons. This one is perfect. The charging system is excellent.  It has a rubber flap that stays secure when the collar is on. Many other don't provide this simple flap. The available setting, number 2, gradually increases the shock until the dog reacts. It is very humane because my dog knows how far she can take it. It allows her to still guard but with a little grumble, just enough to get her point across but stops her from the loud bark. She knows that when she has it on she is off duty.  She calms down immediately when it's on.  It did take consistent use, like any training, but I saw results within days.  I have used it now for 3 months and putting it on her is no big deal. The most important thing is that I don't feel guilty about using it.  She learned very quickly and only got shocked a few times until she understood her limits. It was hard to hear her yelp when it shocked her but I stuck to it and honestly, she learned quickly and the result is amazing. She never gets shocked any more when I put it on her.  It just helps her relax and keeps her in check. As long as she has it on the insane barking at delivery people, strangers, dog walkers, kids on skateboards, and other barking dogs has ceased.

The downside is that it's fairly large and I hate seeing that big box on her neck. But there is not getting around this. They are all pretty ugly. I tried a smaller one once. It looked better but didn't have enough power to work efficiently. Te only suggestion I have is to offer a few different colors instead of black.",5.0,0

"I was super-excited about the original films being released on Blu-ray......until the news arrived that Lucas was further altering them by adding new dialogue.

While the whole ""NOOOO!"" sequence has been much-ballyhooed by viewers, it did somewhat fit in 'Sith.'  For 'Jedi'.....absolutely not.  The original scene, where Vader quietly watches Palpatine attempt to murder Luke and then has a change of heart, is so much more powerful in that Vader makes his decision in complete SILENCE.  Considering that Anakin is depicted as a hotshot motormouth in the prequels, it makes the silence of the original cut of 'Jedi' so much more powerful.  (And, while I'm at it on 'Jedi', why did Lucas have to change the music at the end?  Totally ruined my childhood memories of watching my battered old VHS.)

Look, Mr. Lucas, as a writer/editor both in career and hobby, I can understand about creating something wonderful and then always wondering how it could have been made better.  Seriously, though.  Please stop.  You created an amazing fictional world that became bigger than anyone could have ever dreamed of.  It is a cultural phenomenon that has forever changed film and the lives of fans.  Why ruin a good thing?

"DO NOT buy a Streamlight because you think there's a lifetime warranty, there really isn't. You have to read the fine print.

The problem I have with the company is their misleading use of the term ""LIMITED lifetime warranty"". Let me explain. Streamlight's ""LIMITED lifetime warranty"" doesn't apply to electronics, bulbs, batteries, or switches, just to what they deem as manufacturer's defects. So, basically, their so-called warranty applies only to manufacturing defects in the aluminum body-tube of the light. NOT COOL, Streamlight... you want us to ""Buy American"", but you have a crappily designed switch that wreaks of designed obsolescence.

"*** This review may contain spoilers. Waking Up

by Charles Baxter

While the two have had a lot of fun together, the beginning of the movie is pretty much a family affair. It's a little more serious than some of the other Disney movies, but still a fun ride. The most memorable scene is when the kids are at school and the teacher tells them that there's nothing to do if they go to the library. They're not even allowed to go to the library. The teacher tells them that they can't go to the library if they're not allowed to go. So, they go to the library. The movie is a little too serious and the movie isn't at all realistic. I don't think I've ever seen a movie with a realistic ending. The story line is pretty good. The ending is pretty much a joke. I don't think I've ever seen a movie where a story line is completely predictable. The movie is good. The acting is pretty good. The music is good. The acting is pretty good.

"Based on the novel of the same name by Wiiliam Saroyan, this is a coming of age movie about a teen Homer MacCauley (Mickey Rooney) who takes over as the man of the house when his older brother Marcus (Van Heflin) leaves for WWII. Surprisingly, there is no girl chasing in this movie. Rooney is dead serious as a kid dealing with the changes occurring on the home front and growing up quickly while trying to keep it together for the family which includes his widowed mother play by Fay Bainter, sister Bess (Donna Reed), and brother Ullyses (Jack 'Butch' Jenkins). Thrown into the mix is Homer's often inebriated boss Mr. Grogan (Frank Morgan), the local telegrapher Tom Spangler (James Craig) and Diana Steed (Marsha Hunt as Spangler's romantic interest). While the book primarily deals with life during the war, it is most often viewed through Homer's eyes as he copes with all the changes swirling around him as he works part time at the telegraph office delivering messages most often regarding war casualties.
While this film is populated with a series of vignettes aimed at promoting patriotism, it gets philosophical and spiritual as the dead make commentaries about the changes occurring.
Sappy as it may be, I like this movie. The characters are interesting and the acting is good. The Mickster is oddly affecting as Homer and believable. The casting showcases the talents of a lot of unknown faces such as Reed, Jenkins, Van Johnson, and the bit players include Robert Mitchum, Don Defore, Frank Jenks, Darrel Hickman, Dorothy Morris, Hobart Cavanaugh, Carl(Alfalfa) Switzer, and Barry Nelson. There is even an appearance by Ray Collins as Homer's deceased father.

"The two Michael Powell directed pictures in CLASSIC BRITISH THRILLERS give good indication of the great work he'd produce later, although they are somewhat hampered by small budgets. The James and Pamela Mason murder mystery is quite engaging.

SYNOPSES--

THE PHANTOM LIGHT--  The lighthouse keeper at a quaint Welsh coast village dies mysteriously, and his lighthouse is now supposedly haunted-- an unexplained light keeps shining on the scene of his death. The story's atmosphere is literal, with lots of blanketing fog, plus a murder mystery that's equally shrouded and obscured. Primarily filmed within a lighthouse, this whodunit has more than its share of ethnic humor.

RED ENSIGN--  Leslie Banks plays a somewhat pushy manager of a shipyard whose revolutionary boat design encounters much opposition and skullduggery from the competition and his own financers.

THE UPTURNED GLASS--  A story told in flashback. Neurosurgeon's affair with a married woman ends with her defenestrated death. Suspecting the woman's sister is involved, the surgeon plots revenge on her. Easily the best of this small collection. Co-written by Pamela Mason.

"Husbands don't share power tools.  They are the tools you need to keep your hands in when you need them.  Some of the tools are also designed to be used in a pinch, but it's a little difficult to grip your hand when you are holding it.

"The idea, conceived by producer J. J. Abrams, is brilliant, and the story told here is exciting, riveting stuff. It's tense and, at times, genuinely scary. If not for one little problem, I would have thoroughly enjoyed this film. The problem is in the presentation. Since the entire movie is supposed to come from a single hand-held camera, everything is in Shaky-Cam (or, as Roger Ebert aptly called it, ""Queasy-Cam""). Hence, the movie quickly and continually induces vertigo in its audience; of the six members of my party, four reported some degree of motion sickness. Somewhere further down in the theater, we heard at least one person vomit. No matter how good a movie is -- and this one is, in its way, very very good -- it suffers when you can't bear to look at the screen. It's hard to appreciate the filmmaker's craft when you're trying to keep down the buffalo chicken sandwich you foolishly ate on the way to the theater. by Tom Knapp, Rambles.",2.0,0

"Thunderball feels like the first three early bond films somehow rolled perfectly, cohesively, and successfully into one new original and spectacular film. The movie overall seems balanced with its drama, action, story, and other elements. So it feels like the ultimate Bond movie (Peter Hunt's 'On Her Majesy's Secret Service' is the perfect and excellent closer of the early Bond films).

The intricate and well-developed plot, involving the heist of the two atomic bombs, seems very believable. The cinematography is highly exceptional - there was nothing like the great underwater battle sequences ever done before. The incredible set designs by Ken Adams were marvelously ultra-modern and still look new. And of course, Peter Hunt by this time had perfected the 'jump-cut' editing on this 4th of the great early James Bond films.

Also, a big tip-of-the-hat to director Terence Young, who was more than partially responsible for the savvy and sophistication of the Bond character.",5.0,0

"I am very disappointed in this product.  And, I'm disappointed in myself for not calling Dremel within the first year of getting it and complaining.
First I'll describe my disappointment when it RAN:
--  its heavy
--  its noisy - scares both my dogs.  The less ""sophisticated"" pedi-paw is easier to use and not as noisy.
-- battery charge didn't last long.
Second, when it didn't run:
-- I'd plug it into the charger and into the wall.  It appeared to charge, but upon using it, within minutes it would lose power again.

In the 3 years since I originally purchased this product on Amazon, I have used it only a few times.  I just recently saw it in the ""dog grooming box"" and thought, ""Hey, let me try this again, before I throw it out"".  Plug it into charger and into the wall, and nothing.  No light, nada.

So I call Dremel Customer service and explain the general problem I've had with this product since the beginning and asked if based on these symptoms, it is the charger, the battery or both?

The answer was disappointing too.  No idea.  You'd think there would be some experience with this set of problems.
The cost of replacing both the charger and the battery is more than buying a new one at Walmart.
She did suggest sending it into Dremel and explaining and maybe they would do something about it.
I considered that, but spending another $5 or so on shipping for a product that really wasn't very good in the first place is just not worth it.

Maybe the product I received was a lemon compared to all the other great reviews out there.  But still, I found it way too noisy to be useful on an animal.

"Beneath The Twelve Mile Reef was the second or third Cinemascope movie. Cinemascope format was like IMAX format turned on its side - it was wide, rather than tall. Cinemascope movies were in color, and most movies were not in color in 1953. Scenes were typically breathtaking; actors were beautiful or handsome as appropriate. With all that, plot and acting were frequently deficient. BTTMR has more or less adequate acting, its scenes were originally beautiful, and its actors appealed to audiences of the day. That was enough to get it by.

The movie fell into the public domain a while back. Many grainy copies emerged. Also, televisions could not adequately frame the Cinemascope format, so copies were abbreviated laterally. As a result, all the elements that originally sold this movie were neutralized. The version I purchased on Amazon VOD was unforgivably poor, and of course the deficient plot remains. Indeed, the writing is less forgivable than the appearance.

At some point, it seemed to me that I had been watching this turkey for an awfully long time so I checked to see how much more I had to endure. The ROKU told me four minutes. Hmmm. Four minutes. Problem was the movie still had a half dozen plot lines unresolved. I continued the movie.

In four minutes, the bad guys showed up, there was a fight, then everybody kissed and made up, the meanest bad guy happily gave his girl to the youngest good guy, and the credits rolled. Four minutes. (Did I mention?)

That's... really... bad script writing! You almost have to admire it!",1.0,0
"The overall production quality of ""Lansky"" is barely adequate. This HBO TV special comes across as a film made under severe time and financial constraints. Nonetheless, the acting talent of Richard Dreyfuss is utterly fantastic. The now middle-aged star gives a performance that ranks among his very best. Dreyfuss clearly understands this low keyed Jewish gangster who lead much of American organized crime in the previous century. The character actor Max Perlich also does a splendid job of portraying Lansky during his earlier years. Perlich is a skillful thespian who deserves greater respect and attention. He ought to have received at least an Academy Award nomination for his splendid supporting work in ""Rush.""
Meyer Lansky was something of a highly intelligent mob boss who essentially perceived himself as a misunderstood polite business man; neither better nor worse than the titans of that era's capitalist business organizations. Lansky rationalizations conveniently ignored the fact that murder and other forms of violence are not everyday realities of conventional American capitalism. Lansky, though, was probably correct to conclude that FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover and Senator Estes Kefauver hounded him mostly out of less than noble reasons.
""Lansky"" accurately depicts the Jewish gangsters as far more intelligent than those generally found in other ethnic groups. Also, the Meyer Lanskys, ""Bugsy"" Siegels, and Alfred Rothsteins were the only generation of that ethnic tradition that chose careers in organized crime. Their progeny did not follow in their father's footsteps! Meyer Lansky, for instance, made sure that his own son attended West Point and became a U.S. military officer. ""Lansky"" earns four stars. I highly recommend this movie if you are someone genuinely interested in understanding the motivations of a Meyer Lansky. He may not be an American hero, but Lansky cannot be ignored if you truly desire to comprehend the difficulties of many to assimilate into our national culture.",4.0,0

But from their the jokes were ok, solid for a few good laughs and moments, but not as memorable as many of his past performaces, and nothing that will stick like them either. HE has so much work, at some point you expect a bit of a let off.  But, it was good to see him out still doing it. Although his political correctness is probably the worst ever, what do you expect, it's Carlin.

"This is Mudd.  Backlash, an epidemic of violence and abuse against people who have the courage to stand up and speak out against it, is the backdrop for a film that is very moving and heart-wrenching.  I am very pleased to have it on DVD.

Mudd is a film that is the most emotional, heart-wrenching and heartbreaking film I have ever seen.  It is a film that is on the cusp of making a profound impact on the lives of people who are not only gay, but who are also people who are just as flawed and loved by their families.  This film is a film that can only be seen in the context of the lives of these people, and to them, and to the rest of us, as a film that has the power to change lives.

This film is a film that is about people's courage to stand up and speak out against violence and abuse.  It is a film that is about how people can make a difference, but also how they can live life without it.

"This ball is great, our Catahoula Heeler, Rambo, loves to play with Timmy (we named the ball this when Rambo shoved it into the well ).  The only thing I will caution is the ball is made of heavy duty hard plastic, so if you have a fast dog (like ours) or small dog be careful if  you throw it overhand or it could injure your dog ( I strongly suggest throwing it like a bowling ball at all times).  Also, if you have a Heeler, they love it.  Rambo will play with it for hours and hours and hours, so if you live in the country make sure your dog isn't hurting his mouth or nose with this ball when they first get it.  Rambo rolls on this ball, chases the ball/does soccer moves, cleans the dirt off the ball during rest times and cutest of all will go and and get ball if you ask where Timmy is(he always knows where he put it afterall). The ball has been carried around and chewed on for over a month now by a 70 pound puppy with no bite marks to speak of. The giggle part still works great even though Rambo plays with it on every outside surface imaginable and loves to shove it off ledges and down hills. If he's playing with Timmy we always know where he is, the giggle part is loud enough to hear if you are inside and the ball is being rolled around outside.

"I was looking for a white plastic mailbox post that would fit a large mailbox (Solar Group E1600), that wasn't over $100. I liked the idea of the vortex anchor for this, but the reviews of that were horrible, so I used a standard pressure treated 4x4. The post slides right over it and then you use lag screws to secure it. Oddly you screw it at the edge/corners and not the center of the sides. It made it slightly more challenging, but not impossible. The base also fits snuggly, but is not secured, so you can raise it up to trim grass. The best feature is that the mailbox support is not part of the post, so when you install it you can put it at the exact height you want, so you don't have to plan EXACTLY where the base will be to get the mailbox height correct, you can adjust afterwards.

An installation note, if using a 4x4. You don't have to make the wood post as tall as the mailbox post, the instructions tell you only to make it a foot or so above ground. While I bought an 8' post, and made mine almost as tall as the mailbox post. I could have bought a 4' post instead and would've been fine. (I actually looked for a 6' one, but all Big Orange had less than 8' was the 4'.) That might make it easier to install, and bring the post home. I also thought it was worth renting a post hole digger, I wanted it deep, I knew the roadbed was close (no curb here), and I wanted to save time.",5.0,0
"This is a good quality container and it looks good enough to have ""in the open"" in my kitchen.  The large container is very spacious, I typically buy 13-18 pound bags of food and they fit very nicely (I leave the food in the bag).  The casters are fantastic - being able to wheel this around makes it so easy to clean and keeps the container off the ground.  There are two things keeping me from giving it 5 stars, (1) the scoop is way too big and awkward and (2) the small container is always in the way when stored on top of the big container.  I have bought two of these; I use one big one for ""long term"" storage and keep the two small containers on top.  The other big one I use to hold the food my dog eats on a daily basis.

"Judy Holiday won an Oscar for this film, and no wonder: her performance of Billie Dawn, a ""dumb broad"" who suddenly wises up in a most unexpected way, is certainly one of the finest and most original film performances in 20th Century American cinema. The story, from the stage success, concerns a crass junk yard tycoon (Broderick Crawford) who goes to Washington to buy a Senator--and promptly considers that his blonde-bimbo mistress Billie Dawn (Holiday) lacks enough poise for such refined circles.  He accordingly entices a reporter (William Holden) to ""smarten her up.""  But things soon get out of hand: once her mind is awakened, Billie Dawn begins to perceive her lover and his political intrigues in a very different light.
The comedy is genuine, and Crawford and Holden are as memorable as Holiday herself.  But there is some serious stuff behind the hilarity: issues of personal integrity, honesty, and civic duty become increasingly important as Billie evolves, and ultimately she must make a choice between her old life and a new one.  The film very neatly balances its comic elements with its serious side, and neither predominate nor throw the film off center; director Cukor steers a perfect course.  A must-see and a must-own.",5.0,0
"While our daughter is serving time in the US, we've tried a lot of different foods and we've found that the best thing for her to get through her food bowl is to go to the bathroom and look at the food in her bowl. If she doesn't like the food, she'll eat it.

Our daughter also loves the chicken and rice dishes. She has a tendency to just eat the chicken and rice dishes and that's fine because she loves the food. She doesn't like the chicken and rice dishes, but she does like the chicken and rice dishes.

Overall, it's a great bowl that doesn't have a lot of waste. It's a bit difficult to clean, and we're using the same bowl for our dog. It's also a bit heavier, so it's not the best for small dogs.

"The toilet was making a lot of noise while flushing. I discovered that the similar float unit was leaking. I ordered this part, got it two days later and installed it with no problems. Previously  I had a plumber retrofit all the stop/shutoff valves to the new quarter stop valves. This cost a few hundred dollars, but it is well worth the cost. The old screw turn valves with the spun steel water lines are notorious for leaking after they have been installed  many years and you try and shut them off. The new quarter turn valves eliminate that problem and also come with a high pressure braded steel hose that is easy to disconnect. That made changing this fill valve a snap. I turned off the water at the quarter turn valve, flushed the toilet, got a sponge to dry up any water left in the tank, disconnect the water line, remove the old valve, compare it to the new valve and adjust the height if needed, install the new valve, turn the water on. Check for leaks. DONE!  The new valve works great, and was delivered to my door for about the same price as it would have cost to go to the hardware store.",5.0,0

"Use With Care! This product worked wonders on the hair algae I couldn't get rid of. I tried everything first. I moved my tank away from sunlight. Changed to a lower light source. Set my lights on a timer. Sprayed things down with 3% hydrogen peroxide. Cleaned hard items in Clorox and then soaked in anti-chlorine water. Boiled my gravel. I mean I tried EVERY THING! I tried AgaeFix, but it caused my harlequin rasbora tetras great distress. I finally purchased this. I cleaned my tank very well with a 75% water change. I did the dosage of 1 drop per gallon. The tetras and Cory catfish took it well. My live plants looked fine. In fact I completed the 3 days of dosage with no trouble. My tank never developed algae after this for a month. The sand, rocks, plants, glass look great! Wow!!! So here is the caution. I believe from what I read that the chemical can lower the oxygen level in the water, the first time cleaning my tank for maintenance, I thought I would do this again-as a preventative. My tetras on the third day are clearly distressed again. From what I read if you see your fish gulping at the top of the water, they may not be getting enough oxygen. Mine were not this time, but I have two very busy air stones and a good filter system in my 20 gal tank. My small goldfish in my five gal did not do so well, and died. I think the were not able to tolerate this stuff. So, this is what I think. If you have tried everything else, try it. Use it when you really need to get the algae under control. If you have not used it before on a particular type of fish, go slow, and maybe try half the dosage. More is not always better.",4.0,0

"It seems reasonably well made, but they didn't mention that it takes a T6 bulb in the description. The body is too thin to accept anything else, e.g. a candelabra base flame bulb.

Also, the switch is next to the plug which means that to turn it off, you have to get down to the outlet where it's plugged in! Not very convenient.

It's also not really very well made. When you put a bulb in it, the socket sags so one end of the bulb is visible. Overall it's a bit flimsy.",3.0,0

"My cat only likes to drink running water.  Before we bought this, he would beg at the water faucet when we washed our hands.  We feared that he was not getting enough water so we purchased this item.  It came fast and was easy to put together.  It came with one filter that will eventually need to be cleaned or replaced.  It is not as loud as I expected after reading other reviews.  I put ours on the bathroom counter for our cat and you can only hear it if you are in the bathroom.  It sounds like a water fountain which I think is nice.  Several people have complimented it not realizing it was a cat water bowl.  The cat loves it and took to it right away.

I like the size for my dogs, but I like the fact that they don't have a leash on their body.  I also like that the harness is adjustable, so they can't pull or jump out of the harness.  I like that the material is soft, not too soft.  It is also made of tough plastic and the dog doesn't seem to mind wearing it.  It's also a good quality dog collar.

I guess it just seemed like a lot of people were so bored with Star Trek. This season seemed to be pretty good. I don't know if I'm going to watch this again, but I will. I love the characters, the story, the special effects, the acting. I really liked the actors, the humor, the dialog.

"Pet diapers are a must for me, as they are the perfect size for my small baby girl.

"Michael Weiss and the other creators of this redux of the Jules Verne classic posit that someone who actually made the trip to the center of the earth through a volcanic tube told the story to Verne. In short, Trevor Anderson (Fraser) is a struggling geologist who has been trying for ten years to prove his brother Max's theory that the Jules Verne tale is real.  Trevor's inherited project is about to be closed down when his sister in law brings his 13-year-old nephew, Sean, (Hutcherson) to stay for a couple of days.

Along with Sean's baggage is a box of Max's things, including his hand-annotated version of ""Journey to the Center of the Earth."" Based on Max's notes, Trevor realizes that his brother actually was close to proving his theories before he disappeared. Coincidentally, the geological conditions are perfectly matched to those under which Max died.

This brings Trevor and Sean to Iceland, where Max was last seen.  They hire mountain guide, Hannah (Briem),  who was also the daughter of another Vernian, to take them up the mountain to one of Max's monitoring sites.

Through a freak accident, they end up falling through a cave down into the center of the earth.  Thus, their journey to return begins.  You will see elements of the threats from the original novel--in 3D if your theatre supports it.  Much of the film is a wild ride with vestiges of ""Temple of Doom"" style mine shafts and water slides that will leave you gasping.

The 3D effects are pretty stunning, which is probably the best part of the film with a few touching scenes included between Trevor and Sean.  Overall, seeing the remake was a satisfying experience intensified by the special effects.

Note:  Due to 3D, my theatre had a surcharge for the glasses which made the matinee price of the film close to $[...].

Warning:  Those with vertigo, migraines, seizures or other motion-triggered illnesses might want to use caution in seeing this film.

One would only eat if tablet was crushed, but did so readily after crushed and bits/powder hidden in pocket.

At least they worked (with some additional trickery) on 4 out of 5.  And not having to brave the claws and sharp teeth when trying to stuff a tablet or capsule in mouth of 4 out of 5 is EXCELLENT !!

Very easy to use, but a bit ""greasy"".  So much easier than trying to force pill down their mouth or chopping up and carefully slicing center of hotdog to hide pill in it, and probably a lot healthier for them  (and me!).

"My pit mix loves this toy. The only problem is that it's kind of hard to put together. If you don't get a solid piece, the plastic part will fall apart and you'll have to put it together again.

"So, I wanted to remove an item from my tank. First, I should say, I have a 25G aquarium with a Cascade 700 filter. Which is a canister filter for aquariums up to 65G. Obviously I'm over filtering and it creates a strong current, which I like because I primarily do a planted tank.

Pros;
1) It kept my tank at a very stable 82 degrees. I kept it high on purpose as I breed German Blue Rams. It was fabulous, and I temp gauge always seemed to be working. It turned on/off appropriately.
I really like this stability because it can be harder to get it with glass/titanium heaters that are inside the aquarium.

2) Another item out of the tank! Seriously, it was so nice not having a heater in the tank.

Cons;
1) The main reason I'm sending this back is that it extremely and negatively impacted the water flow rate. In the instructions it says to put it on the outfilter tube -- and I did, but because this device has to be VERTICAL to avoid air bubbles getting trapped, rising to surface, and damaging it-- I had to have a lot of extra tubing. This significant drop in outflow made it impossible for it to properly aerate my water, and it also allowed for algae spores to settle.

Now, a solution to this would be ideally to put it into the infilter tube instead.  However, because I have a planted tank I ultimately decided against this. I didn't want to to deal with lots of gunk getting in the heater pipe. =/ I mean, that's the idea essentially to putting it on infilter over outfilter. It would be easy enough to clean out, but I looked at it as another frustration.

So, because of the cons, I ended up returning it. I mean, even with a circulation pump in my aquarium, I hated that the filter had been impacted so dramatically.",3.0,0

"We previously had the Tetra Waterfall Globe which was pretty, until the extremely thin glass shattered in my hands during a cleaning. So... enter our new tank (and new fish, sadly our old betta met an unfortunate - not tank related - end)...

We have a fancy goldfish that is absolutely loving his new tank, as are we.  He's been in his home for a week, his water is still crystal-clear, and the tank was a breeze to set up and maintain.  I honestly couldn't be happier.  My only (slight) concern is that the tank goes get a tiny bit warm when the light is on (up to about 76/78) so it's not perfectly ideal for goldfish if you want the light on all the time, as apparently they prefer a bit cooler water.

There's plenty of room to play with decorating (I have the 5gal hex), and I'm just itching to go buy at least a snail & couple of tiny companions for Turkey-the-Goldfish because this is such an enjoyable tank you really want to take advantage of it.

Honestly, I can't recommend it highly enough.",5.0,0

No wonder an illustration is shown not an actual image of the item.  I will add my own.  I thought the bottom portion would be a beautiful chrome.  NOPE.  1970s kitchen plastic!

I did love the way it will stay in the spray mode, you don't have to keep pulling down on the fitting to move it from solid flow to spray time after time like you do with all the others on the market.  Yes its swivel hips moved smoothly as the gears in a great engine, the twelve hours I owned that is.

BUT
- lot of good it did to have all of the nice features when all of it disassembled and bounded across the room.  I tried repeatedly to re-seat it but things kept getting worse.  With the upper fitting being totally plastic every time you grip it especially with pliers its soft threads (whether you protect it with a rag or not) get more misshapen and you can forget ever getting it back to working order if this happens to you.

I had never had one come apart like this.  I didn't even know that the insert which you screw to the faucet was also threaded at the bottom and connects in screw fashion to the swivel element too.  I assumed that area was soldered or otherwise adhered.  Well in this Moen it was just threaded on so when the threads came undone they came undone in two places.... the upper end toward the faucet  and toward the bottom piece!  Ka Boom!",1.0,0

"The OxyLED SL30 is a shining star in the field of compact LED outdoor illumination. I have purchased over a dozen small solar powered outdoor lights in the last few years. Whats not to like in a light that powers up from the sun and helps you see things at night that might be prowling through your yard? The eight chip light panel is rated for 100 lumens, seeing it at night and comparing to an 80 lumen LED flashlight I would tend to agree that the output is correct. You get a nice clean white light with a good spread. No it's not a 300 watt halogen - but at the Amazon price you can build a nice simple array of these to either light a path or walkway. I used double stick tape and applied it to the metal fascia of my shed. It gets full sun most of the day and it lasts an impressively long time into the night. Without too many full brightness triggered events the light ran all night.

All night on a solar light is NOT the norm. I have a dozen models of lights from the local Menards and they won't give a reliable four hours on a charge, one season of weather and they are all junk. The only other path light I use is made by GE and runs about $35/light and can make the overnight haul with power to spare. I am going to add several more SL30's to the line posts on my fence and see about creating a ring of solar lighting around the yard.

The only thing that could make this better would be a remote solar panel. I have a few areas that just don't get any direct sun and a LED unit like this would be perfect with an 8-10ft panel extension.",5.0,0

"I purchased this backpack because I read that this was a way to drain more energy from my dog during our walks.  He is a hound mix and he pulls me all over the place when we are walking and I am by no means a small woman.  As of right now we are at the point of him carrying one water bottle on each side for added weight.  It took a bit for him to get used to wearing this so I didn't want to push him too fast.  I imagine that the most I will work him up to is two water bottles per side as I read that they should carry about 5-10% of their body weight.  I have been very pleased so far with the results, while he does still pull me, he gets tired much quicker which saves my shoulders from his yanking.  I am very impressed by how sturdy this is made.  It was easy to adjust to fit him well, he weighs around 65 lbs.  I anticipate this lasting for many years because I have not even noticed a bit of wear and tear in it yet.  I have had many compliments on how dapper he looks in this backpack and folks seem to love the idea that I am giving him a job to do.  Very pleased with my purchase.

"So, at first I hated this thing. I purchased this for my Oceanic Biocube 29 HQI and I couldn't find a good place for it. I tried the display portion, but the Aqualifter wasn't powerful enough to fill the level correctly within 0 minutes, and the water level had to change at least two centimeters before it would even kick on. I felt it was useless. Then, I relocated the sensor into the 3rd chamber. With my Tunze 9001, it's really tight in the last chamber, but it does fit and it works flawlessly. The water level is topped off about twice a day now and my salinity is stuck perfectly at 35 ppt. I've had no errors with it and I like the many 'safety' features that the controller includes.

This is a good buy for those who want a low-profile level sensor with built-in redundancies to prevent malfunction.",4.0,0
"I was a ballet student and huge ballet fan growing up in the 60s-70s, and had indulgent parents who would stretch their budget to allow me the occasional journey from Long Island to Manhattan to see visiting and NY ballet companies.  I was privileged to personally see a Fonteyn & Nureyev performance with the Royal Ballet, one of their last, of ""Marguerite & Armand"" at the Met in NY, and she was an aspiring young dancer's dream - beautiful, graceful, classic with perfect form, and what EMOTION; she was the only ballerina I ever saw who put her whole heart and soul into the character, and owned it.  It is wonderful that some of this talent is preserved in films like ""Evening with the Royal Ballet"" and also Czinner's ""Royal Ballet,"" both of which feature Fonteyn in select acts of famous ballets.  I have also recently purchased the Fonteyn biography by Meredith Daneman which was interesting but mostly speculation; if you really want to learn about Fonteyn, her art always came first, and it is much better to snap up as many performance DVDs or tapes as you can find like this one, to have a true understanding of this amazing prima ballerina assoluta and why she was so beloved.",5.0,0

After all, it was the prettiest fountain out there, plus it is mostly ceramic. My poor boy loved drinking from it! I had concerns because of all the bad reviews but was optimistic that I would have a good experience. I returned the first one to Petsmart, which is where I purchased it and decided to take a try on another one ... some of us take longer to learn than others! That one started leaking all over the floor after cleaning it for the first time when I had it for little more than 1 week. Yes, the nut on the bottom was tightened. Same experience a number of other reviewers wrote about. The water was no longer coming up through the top end of the fountain, instead started coming out the bottom. I was so disgusted I just through it in the box and drove it back to Petsmart. I will try one of the cheap ones now and see if it works. At least if it breaks, I won't feel like I got taken for a ride. I paid over $80 for this piece of garbage! LISTEN TO THE BAD REVIEWS!!!",1.0,0

"I'm pretty impressed with this litter trap mat. The material is spongy and soft for the cat to walk on and it's big enough to cover the entrance to our litter box while still providing a lot of cover on either side and in front so the cat can't just jump over it on the way out. The spacing of the material is wide enough so that it really can be vacuumed and shaken out (the previous litter trap mat we had was made from a similar material but once litter got in there it was very hard to get out even after vigorous shaking or vacuuming). It's also a little thicker so that it doesn't feel flimsy. I've had some half-circle litter trap mats and they seemed like a good idea but left too much space on the sides of the entrance. This one covers everything. I really like this thing. Some reviewers mentioned a strong plastic smell when opening this and that's true but it's not a big deal. It's a mat that sits outside your cat's litter box, so plastic odor is not a big deal.

It's definitely not perfect and doesn't catch all litter, but with good positioning it captures most and that perfect product that does it all hasn't been invented yet.",5.0,0

"Only needing a CO detector in one room, I don't think these combo CO/smoke detectors are a very good idea.  (Maybe if I needed a lot of CO detectors I would, however.)  Make sure you save the directions, as well as memorize how many horn beeps there are for smoke and how many there are for carbon monoxide.  Also, the directions make it seem like there is a smoke LED and a CO LED, when there is only one for both.  In addition, you are not suppose to need to replace the batteries during the 10-year-life of the detector, since it has ""sealed, ten year lithium batteries"", yet the directions state there is a ""low battery chirp"" and tells you to install ""2 new AA batteries"" if that chirping happens?!  (Can you or can you not replace the batteries without deactivating the detector?)  Moreover, if you end up having to deactivate the detector for any reason, it becomes that week's trash.

Now that we've had this for a while, I'd like to add a few things.  We bought two.  We use these as car seats.  The first trip, I put them up high so the dogs could look out the windows.  It didn't go well.  The dogs wanted to jump out and play around so it was a bit of a mess.  Now, I set them on the seat.  I put a towel on the bottom to keep the dogs cozy.  I clip their harnesses to the inner leash and adjust it so they are free to move around but unable to jump out of the seat.  These adjustments have made for much more pleasant traveling.  They ride with the mesh door down and sometimes with it zipped shut and both are well tolerated.

When taking them out to the car, I roll one and I back pack one.  I find that both options work well.  I wouldn't want to roll one long, treacherous distances or do too much backpacking but it works for getting them in and out.  As previously mentioned, I sit the traveler directly on the seat and seat belt them in but when I hung it up higher using the headrest, it worked well and seemed stable.

The pockets allow for leashes.  That's about it.  It's not big enough to store toys or food or whatever.

I am pleased with this purchase.",5.0,0

The size is perfect for our pup. Great for the price. I have a German Shepherd and a German Shepherd mix. I've had this for about a year now and I love the fact that it's made of a durable, tough material that doesn't crack or tear. The smaller size does, however, feel a bit small for a German Shepherd, and the larger size doesn't hold a lot of weight. It's also made of some other sort of plastic, so I don't know why the material feels like it's made of a plastic. I have to give it a 5 for the price. I wouldn't go wrong with this one. It's very durable. I would recommend this for a German Shepherd. I love this food. I have been feeding it to my cats for about 2 years now.",3.0,1

He was a little skeptical at first, but since it was a must for him and was a huge deal for him he has bought it for him for a few years. He also loves it. It is made of metal and has a plastic base. It is very sturdy and well made. It has a very nice grip to it, and the plastic is a nice touch. It is made of nickel and has a soft rubber coating to it. It is very well made, and very easy to use. It is easy to set up and work with. It is very sturdy and it is easy to adjust. It does not come with a hook, and it is a small plastic hook, so if you are going to hook it up you will need a small hook, but for most people this is not a problem.

If I could give this 0 stars I would. We have 2 cats and 2 litter pans making us have to change the litter once a week. This stuff clumps and is ultra fine making it nearly impossible to scoop because half the pan becomes like solid clay when liquid is introduced and the litter gets everywhere. We now have to change the litter about every 2-3 days. I will never recommend this garbage to anyone and will never buy it again. With how many good reviews and buys this had I was really excited but all we got was a tiny bag and complete disappointment.

The plastic gate does not move and it does not feel secure on my dog's collar.  I have used it a couple of times, and it is still working.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone.This is a great product for getting your dog to go in and out of the crate.  I have a 10 year old Lab and he is not quite as active as I thought he would be.  He is very active and has not gotten into the crate and there is no pain or discomfort in his neck.

One other thing, I found some cheaper bulbs that looked like the dark amber bulb but I decided to call the place to assure that they were the dark amber they had pictured.  I wanted assurances they weren't gold.  I was told that they could not guarantee anything because it depended on the manufacturer.  Sometime the bulbs they got were gold, sometimes dark amber, and they didn't know what they had in stock at that time.  Needless to say I didn't order them.

"Well, it just came in the mail and I was so excited (my 7 months old adopted dog is a mad chewer, particularly on cords) that I opened it immediately and began to put it on my iPad cord. I carefully put it in and squeezed it shut to be sure no actual cord was exposed. It stunk like mad, but I figured that would die down and at least my cords weren't being destroyed - heck, if I had to I could charge it in another room, right? I had the 10 foot size open because it's a long cord, so only a small piece had to be trimmed. My fingers are reeking by now, and I'm about to eat lunch, but hey, the dog won't chew on it, right? I deliberately left the cord on the floor while I went to make my lunch, peeking in on the puppy. Stayed away completely, so I couldn't tell if it would deter. Went in to eat (or try to, it really smelled fresh out of the package) and the puppy was sitting off to the side, behaving himself, so...... WAIT! What's that. He's chewing on the small piece of cord protector I cut off. And as I watched to see if it bothered him at all, he continued to worry it and chew.
Maybe this stuff works on some dogs. I'm going to have to try the bitter Apple repellant spray I bought along with this and hope for the best. Sure wish I hadn't gotten 2 packs of each size though. With that smell, and the poor results, no way I'm using it.",1.0,0

"I bought this for my dog  and he likes it very much, which says a lot because he is usually a picky dog. This food actually looks similar to corned beef, minus the white colored fat, this just has a spoonful of congealed juices at the bottom of the can. I did think it would have more gravy in it given its sold as a gravy cravers dog food but that's alright, I can add just a little warm water for gravy. Its mostly a smooth pate of food, except the Filet Mignon, that has slight chunks along with the pate. This doesn't smell nasty, it actually does smell quite good. Similar to canned beef stew. All and all, this is a very good canned food for the price. Its also nice that I can have it shipped to my home with prime. Another thing, I wanted to mention, I've seen the reviews others have left saying their dog had gastrointestinal upsets, mine did not, I think it does vary from dog to dog, but I've not had any issues.

"Ok, a few hours earlier, I reviewed a fan that even had a speaker in it. It really didn't blow much air. So, I get home earlier today and this fan had arrived. So, i charged it all day. I didn't have much in the way of expectations. It doesn't have as many features. Let's see what features it does have, according to the manufacturer...

Features
1X Handheld palm sized portable fan, powered by a rechargeable battery (included) or by the provided micro USB charging cable via computer/notebook, car charger, power bank, 5V wall USB charger, 5v solar charger etc.
3 adjustable speeds plus an LED light on the side, perfect seaming, made of top quality ABS
Highly efficient yet practically quiet; powerful yet energy saving, perfect for your office, dorm, home etc.
Please make sure the battery is placed correctly inside the slot before you turn on the fan.
Best cooling effects can be achieved when you hold it in your hand. Great fan for when you are out and about.

I got home from work tonight and as soon as I saw the fan, I went straight for it. As soon as I turned it on, I immediately felt more are than the other fan on high. It had two more higher settings! And it also has a light, so if your power goes out, you have a fan AND a flashlight! I love this thing already! Five stars for this little powerhouse of a fan! Oh, and it's cheap too!

Without that, these are cool white (I ordered the 6000K bulbs because of the covers). I had 4 of the 25 watt halogens in my chandelier drawing 100 watts total. With these bulbs, I am drawing only 3 watts each at 12 watts total. It is just as bright. The bulbs should last a lot longer and didn't cost any more than the halogens I bought at Wal-Mart.

Have had this drill for about 4 years.  Carried in my pickup for quick repairs on family jobs.  Have now gone through 4 sets of batteries (8).

"I have a lot of assorted bungee cords. They have come from a variety of sources: Costco specials, Harbor Freight, etc. This S. Main Hardware collection of various sized cords compares pretty well with my herd of cords in all but one respect.

Pros:
+The size assortment is good for many tasks
+ The container makes it easy to toss this set of cords in the van, ready for taking home the next _____ thing that needs to go on the luggage rack.
+++ The hooks are very nicely done. Instead of being a single thickness of wire with a rubber protector or other flimsy treatment on the end of the hook, the hooks are doubled over so that there is no sharp end that needs protection. This is great!
+ There are a lot of cords in the can.

Cons:
- I don't think these have quite the elastic range of my other cords. Not a deal killer, and I take a measurement in percent of unstretched length, but I'm gonna say these have about 20% less reach than I would have expected. I have been thinking of a way to verify this by getting a scale like those used for fishing and then pulling the end of one of these to see how far it goes with 10# of pull and doing the same with others. I'd have to have an assistant to measure the length it pulls, then do some calculations. In the meantime, my observation is as above.

Summary:

I'd still get these if they are a good price because of the hooks, which are safer for you and your gear because of the nicely finished hook tip.",4.0,0

You do not have tell a lie when you do not have to say something. In the movie it considers you have to say what you are thinking. It is not real.

What people say is not always sure it is true or ""not true"". For example, if I say I am going to meet you at 9AM, and I show up at 9:05. Is it a lie?

"This is our 2nd time buying this litter. We have 2 cats and 2 litter boxes. This litter helps to keep the cat urine smell away and reduces cleaning  time significantly. The urine does not clump so you simply swish through it with the litter scoop and it blends away. I also notice that solids seem to dry up more in this litter. Litter box smells are something that I was constantly battling since I am always worried when guests come over, especially since 1 box is in the guest bathroom. Our screened in porch always had a faint cat urine smell because our 2nd box is out there and the cat with the strongest odor uses that one. After using only this litter for over a month, there isn't an odor anywhere anymore.

I am able to fill up each litter box and the litter lasts for about 4 weeks before needing changed. You can tell by the urine not swishing away as normal and starts to get tiny clumps in it. Even then, it doesn't leave a strong urine smell.

I honestly wouldn't use another litter as long as I can help it. The ONLY thing I do not like about this litter is that is has a ton of dust when filling up the litter boxes and a little when swishing through it. Because of this, I usually fill it up outside.

"My son actually wore out his videotape copies of Scooby Doo and the Cyber Chase, Zombie Island, and Witch's Ghost. That's how much of a Scooby fan he is and has been since he was first introduced (he's 10 now).

This is actually a much better movie than some of the latest efforts (e.g. AbracadabraDoo) in my son's opinion. It was scarier (I think Zombie Island and Witch's Ghost are scary too and he agrees) and less ""campy"" then some of the others we've watched lately. He was mesmerized by it from the moment it arrived - and has watched it several times. I thought the music was good and the voice acting decent enough. A bonus episode from the TV series is included which my son enjoyed as well.

"This movie is wonderfully simple and sincere in presenting its message. The story is based on the life of Patrick ""Tyler"" Doherty. It presents the question ""Why God?"" Here is an upright church-going family, where firstly the father and main bread winner dies unexpectedly, and then the younger of two brothers is diagnosed with a rare breed of brain cancer, that is quite aggressive.

Most Christians believe in divine healing, but what is the response supposed to be when a much needed healing does not take place in the life of a young innocent boy? This is the scenario that is presented. Each member of the family suffers from the pressure of this situation and Tyler's grandmother steps in as a source of help and encouragement.

Tyler keeps his faith and starts writing his letters to God in order to keep his perspective of things and those around him. In an apparent answer to one of these letters, a new postman shows up and befriends the family. He has his own family challenges, but Tyler's resolve and determination motivates him not up give up on trying to solve his own personal problems.

""The Last Man on Earth"" is a two part series about the last man on Earth, a man who is in his late twenties and early fifties.  The story is told in a rather idyllic setting with no real name or place to call it, but the characters and the plots are so convincing that it is easy to understand why they chose to go to the location.  It's very refreshing to see the characters in action, and the setting is absolutely gorgeous, with colorful scenery, great music, a great musical score and a beautiful soundtrack that doesn't detract from the story.

"Well to start with I really wonderd if this tool was going to save me time removing 75 years of paint on my mother in laws house. I orderd it and went right to work with it,about 3 days later I had a large old ranch house down to bare wood and ready for priming. I found that the house had been at least 7 different colors in it 75 years. When using the the stripper  I also used a full face shield and a resperator along with a long sleeve shirt and I put a bib on so that i wouldnt have paint going down my shirt. I also found that the metal disc. would sometimes clog with paint, so I would take a propane torch and burn the paint of the disc and then continue on. I did end up wearing one disc plum out and so I bought a new disc to finish up with. The stripper is a little heavy and your arms are going to get tired but my wife used it after I suspended it with 4 long bungee cords above the location she was working. The bungee cords helped suspend the tool and take the weight off the user. Anyway, the tool is very well made and plenty powerful and it beats trying to use an acid stripper. I will probably use it next to strip the paint off the cabinets in the old house and then make new doors. I can see where a home owner buying an older house could really save alot of money buying this new tool. I build high end custom furniture so i really nit pick my tools not only in there upkeep but in their performance as well and i don't keep any tool that doesnt perform. This new Porter Cable does perform very well and I feel that if your need is for a tool like this the Porter Cable stripper is the only way to go. No more messy & expensive chemical strippers.",5.0,0

"I wasn't bothered by ""Extremely Dangerous'"" obvious borrowing of a central premise from ""The Fugitive."" It was the lack of suspense and surprises that got to me. I expected a thrill ride of a movie, but it never materialized over the long 3-hour 20-minute DVD.

Obviously, the script is the greatest weakness here. In terms of suspense or mystery, it is a total flop. None of the clues amount to much, you can see the supposed plot twists a mile away, and the villains are easy to spot.

The worst part was how the scriptwriter got the protagonist out of scrapes -- much like an old-time serial, there is even a scene where he dives into the water and is surrounded, seemingly without escape. Then, fade out. Fade in to Sean Bean back at his apartment. How he managed to escape is never shown or explained!

What I assume was the lack of much of a budget seems evident by other odd choices. In one scene, a skyscraper is said to be burning to the ground, but instead of seeing any part of it, we're told about it (with the sound effect of sirens in the background). A low budget is not always a liability, if it spurs creativity, which was not the case here.

What might have made this bearable -- an interesting main performance -- is not forthcoming from Bean. He exhibits no range or subtlety. That leaves the interesting bits to supporting actors -- in particular, Nitin Ganatra as a Pakistani cab service operator. His scenes crackle, but little else in the movie does.",2.0,0

"Our Vet recommended these Pill Pockets for our 4 kittens when we switched from using a topical flea medication to a pill form.  When we got home, I placed my order and I was excited to see how this would work!  When this product was delivered, I quickly tore open the package to see what it looks like and exactly how it smells.  Well, I was bummed when all the pill pockets were smashed together instead of being individually separated into a pill pocket form.  However, I did make it work by tearing off a piece, rolling it into a ball and then I placed the pill inside of the ball I made.  I would have returned it but, I did not want to wait any longer since the kittens were overdue on this medication. As for how it smells, it really does not smell like a Salmon flavor to me anyways.

Out of the 4 kittens, 3 loved the pill pockets and wanted more!  Each kitten had their own pill because of their weight so, I kept them separated.  My first kitten, loved the pill pocket, she swallowed it with the pill included.  I was very happy and thought this would be a breeze! Not so much, LOL!  The second kitten ate the pill pocket but, he spit out the pill so, I tried it again and the same thing happened.  The exact same thing happened with the third kitten! When I got to the fourth kitten, she ran away after taking one sniff of the pill pocket.

So, 3 kittens out of 4 love the pill pocket taste but, where smart enough to know that there was a pill inside. Needless to say, it was a very funny experience!  Not to mention what it took us to finally get them to take their pill!",4.0,0

"While I like the idea of my dogs having better breath, this stuff isn't the solution. Pro-Sense has some good products - I'm using their hip and joint supplement for my 14 year old dogs with real success. However, this water additive is a failure here.

None of my dogs will drink the water with even a teaspoon of this added. I keep three huge water bowls through out the house at all times - 6 dogs tend to empty them all at least once a day and twice a day if it's hot. I did two bowls with this added and one plain water. Not one dog would touch the water with the rinse in it. All six went to the untainted water bowl - I had to refill it three times yesterday. This morning I just emptied and scrubbed the other two and refilled with plain water.np Two dogs went right to them.

I lay towels around the house and use the ""beep"" and say ""leave it"" and she does not touch the towels.  I even throw the towels in the air and she does not go for them.  Next I will use the ""shock"" to reinforce.  I always use a tiny treat when she responds positively.  Eventually I hope to leave the bathroom doors open and the towels on the rods without her grabbing them.  I highly recommend this system.",5.0,0
I bought this product because it has the quality and durability of a regular shampoo. I have used it twice before and the hair is soft and shiny and the hair is not pulling at all.

"a lot of the reviews say the consistency is too dry, i was a bit hesitant to buy it after reading that... but i went ahead and purchased this type because i was on a budget and its $10 cheaper than the venison and sweet potato pack. received it today and both of my dogs devoured it. i was feeding them chicken soup for the puppy lovers soul wet food mixed with 1/4 cup dry chicken soup dog food (was still using up the puppy cans, both dogs are on to adult food now) and that stuff smelled like canned dog food. nothing special. they ate it and it didn't make them sick... but i wanted something better and preferably grain free. ran out of the wet the other day before making this purchase and substituted with a scoop of pedigree puppy formula wet food and pretty much within 5 minutes after finishing eating my boy was throwing up. scrapped that can. this stuff smells ALMOST like human food, you can see the potato chunks in it, wich i didn't think were too overbearing, my dogs love potatoes so its not a problem anyways. so far, so good. its been about an hour and neither one has puked.

as for the dry consistency, its not really an issue for me since i just use the wet to entice them to eat their dry food. my boy dog will not eat plain dry kibbles, period. he really seemed to enjoy this stuff.",5.0,0

"We own this bone and went to buy a second one. When I saw it only had 3.5 stars on Amazon, I felt compelled to write a review.

This bone is great. We fill it with peanut butter and freeze it every day for my 40 lb pit bull before he goes in crate.
(1) Very durable. My dog has chewed on it every day for the past 3 weeks and there are no dents in it.
(2) I prefer the glossier material of the Bionic Bone over the more rubbery Kong. The Bionic Bone feels less gross when you pick it up wet.
(3) The Bionic Bone is easy to fill with peanut butter because both sides have holes in them, and it is hollow all the way through. The holes fit the shape of a butter knife well and it is easy to scrape PB off the knife while loading it in.
(4) For the same reasons, it is easier to clean than a Kong (PB tends to get stuck deep in Kongs).
(5) I think that it is better shaped to fit a dog's mouth than the hole of a Kong - my last dog would lose interest in the Kong because he could not reach all PB stuck inside. The Bionic bone is the perfect combination of challenging while not frustrating.

(Sorry Kong - not trying to pick on you.) In conclusion, this is a great product and we are buying a second one.",5.0,0

"Saw Jaws in 75' when I was 7 and then Grizzly came out in 76', the time was about 6-8 months between these two films and it was plain to see this movie was a cash in on the killer animal craze that ran through the mid to late 70s starting with the famous Spielburg film. Stars Christopher George as the park ranger , Richard Jaeckel as a naturalist and Andrew Prine as a vietnam vet running a helicopter service. A 18 foot two thousand pound grizzly goes on the rampage taking out campers , a couple of park rangers before coming to the final showdown with the George character who instead of a scuba tank uses a Lors rocket launcher to destroy the bear. I still enjoy watching it after all these years could have given it 5 stars but that might be pushing it a bit to far. This 2 disc edtion is far better than a earlier version I brought.

"This is a generous portion of cat food with a lot of higher quality ingredients compared to other types of cat food. Primarily, the first ingredient is actual chicken and it includes taurine. It also does not include grains of any kind and, as anyone knows about cat nutrition, grains are not a part of anything a cat needs in its diet. They are junk food and fillers so the primary selling point of this product is that it provides what your cat needs to be healthy without things which it does not need or that can damage its health. So, I'm very pleased with the ingredients list for this product, though I will note that one pays a premium price for the quality.

I can't speak to whether or not the nutrition is as good as the ingredients list indicate it should be, but I can say my cat throws up less after eating this than some other types of food. I can also say that she tends to rapidly lose interest in dry food that I feed her and has held interest in this longer than other types of dry food. I don't know if she's finding it more appetizing (possible, since it has a strong smell and she seems to like stronger smelling food) or if not having digestive issues after eating it makes her favor it.

In terms of value, if my cat continues to eat this up over time, I will keep buying it because, though it may be more expensive, if she will actually eat all of it and I don't have to throw out uneaten food, it'll save me money in the long run.",5.0,0

This one is a little softer, and the smell appears to be better, from my cat's reaction, so it's a partial success.

Update:  (July 12)  She no longer will eat it, and the negative review regarding Consumer Labs' findings about this supplement convinced me not to try to persuade her...sometimes my cats have a good sense of what is healthy for them (or maybe she just doesn't like the taste/smell that much).",3.0,0
"I'm a perfectionist, in all I do and in my work; I expect the same pride in workmanship and design as I put into my own designs and products...

This cheap, thin, tin-like metal has no substance to it at all; its tantamount to a polished tin can. The 'anti spill' ring (atop the bowl) is too large for small breeds such as my 20 pound Shih-Tzu.  It arrived with the rubber, anti-slide/anti-skid, gasket detached, it falls off very easily and is nearly impossible to replace without stretching it, which totally defeats its purpose, in that it falls off almost every time you pick it up.

There is a hollow space under the anti spill, upper rim, that is impossible to keep clean.  Having no instructions, enclosed, who could possibly know that upper anti spill rim is designed to come off?  Good luck managing that feat and be careful not to pinch your skin both wrestling it off and getting it back on.  Having shopped finer boating and camping stores, I found this is a really bad knock off of the ones I have found since.

My really good dog food bowls are stainless steel, incredibly heavy and have lasted 3 lifetimes (dog lives) they cost a small fortune when I bought them 20 years ago, but were more than worth it.  I was looking for comparable water bowls when giving this a try; and it is not even close to being close.

Unless you only need this for the boat or camper for a week or two and a few weekends a year...  Do yourself a favor and buy heavy duty, stainless steel and don't have names put on (unless removable).  Spend the money once and never again.

"My dogs are fairly rough on toys - very few last for more than a week, and many die within a day or two. Obviously I am not alone in this: anyone reading this review is likely looking for a solid, durable toy which will survive the rough play of a chewer or large breed dog (or both).

This ball is not solid, and it is not durable.

The ball looks exactly like the 4.5"" model of a ""Soft & Tough Clutch"" ball I purchased last year. The cyan colored 6"" Soft & Tough Clutch that I purchased is easily my dogs' favorite toy, and has survived for many months now (I think I bought it in November) with nary a scratch. I decided to purchase a second ball because they loved it so much, and I went for the 4.5"" grape ball the next time around.

I took it out of the package and I could immediately feel the difference in the texture. I can't quite explain it, but the Soft & Tough feels exactly how its name describes it. This ball felt soft and rubbery, like the cheap $3-$5 Walmart toys I used to buy before I realized that they only lasted 10 minutes. The difference: this ball didn't even make it 10 minutes.

In less than 3 minutes, my dogs had begun taking chunks off of the ball and it had to go to the trash can. Put another way: prorated out, I was paying about $180/hour for this dog toy!!!

Bottom line: I am not sure if I got an imitation/knock-off, or if the balls are made by different companies. They look the same and are advertised the same on Amazon, but there was a clear and discernible difference in texture between the two balls, and that translated into the difference between a long-time favorite toy, and a 3-minute pile of garbage.

So buyer beware: the ""Soft & Clutch"" line earns 5 stars and then some, while the Soft-Flex ball is solidly in the ""don't waste your money on this"" category.",1.0,0

"Originally released in 1934 as ""Babes in Toyland,"" this film is far and away the best of the Laurel & Hardy operettas.  The evil Barnaby (Henry Brandon), wants to force the lovely Bo-Beep (Charlotte Henry) to marry him.  Towards this end Barnaby banishes Bo-Beep's beloved Tom-Tom (Felix Knight) and attempts to take over Toyland with his demon army.  Fortunately, Stannie Dum and Ollie Dee, the assistants of the Toymaker (William Burgess), save the day with the help of the marvelous giant-sized Wooden Soldiers.  Based on the operetta by Victor Herbert (several songs are omitted), this film was directed by Gus Meins and Charles Rogers, and is much superior to the Disney version that ended up replacing it on television.  You will find less slapstick than usual in a Laurel & Hardy film, but the boys are better integrated into this musical than any of there others and Brandon's Barnaby is deliciously wicked.

"I've used this for years on my front lights to welcome us home. In the driveway an infrared type light makes sense, but on the front lights using this timer in the automated setting is best.

Installation:
I fist use a contactless voltmeter to find the Hot Wire (has 120v current)  hooked up to the light switch and mark it with nail polish. Then go turn off your circuit breaker. Next go an connect the BLACK wire to the one which you just marked with nail polish. You will need to find your neutral, which is generally white and NOT connected to a standard two pole light switch. Just find the neutral and some white 14 gauge solid white wire and create a pig tail; then connect it to the white wire with an electric wing nut. Lastly, connect the blue LOAD wire to the wire which was connected to your switch. Sometimes you might have a green wire which was a ground wire. I just loop it around the screw as I reinstall all the wires. I also tend to wrap everything in electric tape as I go to ensure no shorts anywhere.

"First off, this thing is big. If you don't have an application that requires a big, long spout, this is probably not a good choice for you. I did need one because I have a large soaker tub with a wide rim and a wall mounted faucet. It was really tough to find a long wall mounted spout that wasn't really expensive.

Its why Go Pro makes curved helmet mounts. Its a big deal, because enough of the VHB tape does make contact. Also, the holders are two different sizes. There is no instruction as to which goes where.

"Acorn Media has provided the DVD with english subtitles which are helpful not only to people who have hearing impediments but to foreigners (specially when politician explain very quickly intricate schemes, with names of men we know nothing about). The story is very interesting from an historical point of view. It begins with Napoleon III being dismissed and ends some times after the Second World War is over. Politics are not seen from Sirius, but through magnifying glasses: dayly and often cynical calculations, fights against political ennemies or so-called friends. Randolph's every days life is a sort of thrilling gambling. For instance, he resigns his charge, thinking the government will become aware it can't do without him; in case it doesn't  Randolph will found a new Tory group, modern, kenner on social issues, and overcome the old Tory party. We see how times are changing: at the beginning of the story, upper classes are extremely conservative, prjudiced with birth, wealth, morals, etc and at the end, one of Jennie's niece, an artist, goes to Russia on her own to see what communism is like. Lady Churchill is a fascinating woman! Clever, brave, ambitious, free, quite different from the other women of her time. With such  ""political beasts"" as his father and mother were, we understand why Winston Churchill (remarkably played by Warren Clark) was so outstanding a stateman. Love stories don't lack in the movie; I found particularly moving the love affair between Jennie and the long-suffering Count Kinsky (embodied by the wonderful Jeremy Brett; if you like him, look at ""posthumous Bafta for Jeremy Brett"" on facebook).Though many tragic events occur (Randolph illness and demise, wars...), the dialogues, always brilliant, are often amusing: clever, cynical, sparkling with wit. People of the high society are depicted in a satirical way. Everything is beautiful: houses, costumes, music, actors: Lee Remick, Jeremy Brett...I find 361 minutes were hardly enough.",5.0,0

I did get a free item for review purposes and so far the cats love it.  They are able to go outside on it and it is well made and does not leak.

"I feed two indoor fairly picky cats, and a colony of about five outdoor non-picky cats.  So I have a built in team ready to help me test cat food!  I was eager to try this dry food.  It's always good to read on the bag about the caring people that put together foods for our feline friends, and this one looked well thought out and full of interesting and nutritious ingredients (although I always do wonder if cats really need cranberries or sweet potatoes or the like, but they are used to take the place of grains, which I am sure cats don't need).

Well, my feline crew did not care much for the food.  The indoor cats did eat it eagerly for the first few bites---they must have liked the smell or the look---but after that, they shunned it.  They would not eat it at all, and in fact found things around the house to put on top of the plates of it---something they do to bury food they really don't care for.  The outdoor cats were not much more of fans.  They ate a bit of it, and then looked at me with annoyance, wanting their usual cans.  I left the dry food down, and later in the day they did eat a small amount, but most of it was left by the end of the day, which is quite unusual.

So---no matter how well made and well meaning a cat food is, if your cats won't eat it, it's not really worth it.  I can't say what it is they didn't like---I wish I could get that information from them!  Perhaps you have less picky cats---lucky you!",3.0,0

The Directors should have done their home work on the German regalia. Uniforms and emblems where worng. At about 1 hour 20 minutes into the film it shows a date Agust 21st 1944 and the apparent Russian attck which drives the Germans out. In reality this happened in July 1944 when the Red Army re-took Przemyael.

"This was a pain to assemble (you need strong thumbs to force the clips onto the wires), but so very worth it!  A friend bought me this as a gift, and the shelves are so much bigger than the other pen I have that full-sized cat beds fit easily on them.  In fact, it's assembled in my living room and operating as the ultimate cat tree.  I have a cat bed on each shelf and 2 in the bottom, and the cats spend a good chunk of time in there voluntarily.  I'm thinking of attaching a couple of dangling cat toys to the top so that they can play in there as well, but it's turned out to be their favorite napping place other than next to the human on the lounge.  I have 7 cats and would seriously consider getting a 2nd one, so that they can all nap in one when I'm not here to curl up next to.  Also considering putting litterboxes in the bottom of one... may just encourage use.

Clips were changed between original instructions and shipping, there were updated instructions in the bag with the clips, they weren't hard to understand, but took some serious torque with my thumbs to get them clicked into place.  And, while they work fine on the sides, for attaching the top they seem a bit iffy.  I am using nylon slip ties to help tighten that up since I have cats who like to scale the outside of it and sit on top -- I may even put a pet bed up there and tie it in place for my 2 serious climbers.

"Positives:
Great acting performances by Pippi and her penguins. Mostly good by everyone else except Carrey and Lansbury, at times, reverted to their stereotypic past learned phrasings and characterizations.
Enough uniquely humorous lines and skits to make the movie a mostly novel laughable experience. So, kudos to the writers for those parts.

Negatives:
Studios with their crew of writers, directors and producers know that making money takes precedence over creativity so with that thought in mind we have the following too predictable scenes:
A stereotypic plot framework of a newly divorced couple with teens.
Teens have their own issues as well as navigating/mediating the divorce.
Dad, as usual, had his own father family issues growing up.
Dad is seen as more in love with his monied vocational interests than the kids.
Mom, has a new male friend that ends up to be a boor. Yes, gets booted.
At stake is a prize piece of property that is predictably going to be procured by Dad after he re-prioritizes with the help of, guess who, penguins.
Dad also wins kids and wife after he re-prioritizes with the help of, guess who, penguins.
Penguins, at first, were presented in a clever way but towards the end the writers ran out of ideas and the animals just did the same made-up cute tricks found in most animal movies.

In summary, if the movie just had Pipi and the penguins to build around it would have had the potential to be creatively - spot on.",2.0,0

James MacArthur who played Danno in the series preceding the eleventh and twelfth seasons is sorely missed.  As good as the new characters are such as William Smith (always a pleasure to watch) it just isn't the same, along with weaker and almost ridiculous story lines.  It is the opinion of this viewer that perhaps Jack Lord was not the easiest individual to work with.  His character overall tended to be rather absent of nuance and depth.  Without Danno and all the other wonderful personalities around him, he rather fades into background.  The very final episode has Lord as the sole ""hero"" finally ensnaring his nemesis Wo Fat.

"Ever season of Beauty and the Beast has woven its spell around me a different way. In the first season, we learn of the development of Catherine and Vincent's relationship, as well as being introduced to the wonderful people Below. In the second season we saw the two hero's love fourish and the different trials and tribulations they had with separation issues, and Vincent's internal demons.

The third season, in my opinion, is what really shines out of the entire series. While there are only 12 episodes, the excellent writing and story arcs completely make up for it. Ron Pearman is at his best as Vincent. Really, in my opinion, his best acting the entire series. You also really get to know more about what makes people tick ""above"" and how Catherine really touched everyone she met.

You gain more respect for Eliot Burch, Cathy's on-off boyfriend from earlier times. Joe Maxwell gets a real backbone, and I kind of disliked him at times. New character Diana certainly does NOT take Catherine's place, and her and Vincen't relationship is far from being a romantic one.

"When my Yorkie was about to leave, she jumped in front of me and just brushed her teeth. I had to get a tooth comb out to get the toothpaste out, but it worked well and she didn't mind it at all. I bought this for my dog who is a chewer. He will go to the vet and the dog will start to notice the difference. It does not smell like dog food and he will be able to feel better. It's very easy to put on and it seems to really help with his teeth. I have a vet who makes a lot of money and does a great job on dog teeth. I am very pleased with this product and will continue to purchase it. I would recommend this product for anyone with a dog with a sensitive tooth. I have used this for about a year and it still works. My dog is a big chewer and I thought this would be a good toy for him. Unfortunately, he was just too big for my 18 pound dog. I took it to the vet and he told me that he had found a new toy that was very different and I was worried that it was not a toy he would be able to play with. I took it back and it is a great toy for him. He loves it. He has a very picky eater and will eat anything and anything. I love that it is made in the USA. My dog loves this toy. I put him through his paces in the sandbox and have never seen him tear it apart. It is a great toy for a little girl with a long and strong coat.",5.0,1

"Ok, I received this blade about a week ago and decided to replace the 60T stock blade on my Kapex for a large built in job.  This required me to cross cut a LOT of 3/4 and 1/4 oak plywood.

Will post more info in a few weeks.

If you have been looking for a pair of the best ear plugs in the world, you're in luck. This ear plug is made in China.

"After reading the reviews, I was hesitant to order the Revolution.  I watched some of the YouTube video reviews and was a little more encouraged.  I ordered it from Amazon because they had the cheapest price, and I know they have hassle free returns if needed.  The saw arrived today and after unboxing it I am impressed.  It showed up without any damage, and was set to go right out of the box.  Took all of two minutes to put together.  I do agree that the hold down clamps are cheap, but I don't really need them so not a big deal.  The blade was square and true right out of the box.  I am only using it to cut metal and the couple test cuts I did were no problem.  For the money, it beats the metal chop saw that is slow and leaves way to many burrs.  This saw did not leave any burrs.  I will update in a month or two and let you know how things are working.  But so far, would recommend it.

Update:  I have been using the saw for a few months now and love it.  I cuts clean, burr-free, and with little spark.  The laser guide is dead on and makes cutting miters a breeze.  I sold my Dewalt abrasive saw and don't miss it one bit.  The blade still cuts like butter even after months of constant use.  I use it only for cutting metal and would highly recommend!",5.0,0

"I bought 1 of these to compare against other bulbs because it had decent reviews. This one was ok, but not as nice as the G7 Power G7GU10300WW for the same price. Please consider trying the G7 bulb and read my review of it.

UPDATE Dec-31-2013:

HitLights has sent me the updated bulb for 2014 to compare with the older bulb, and I'm pleased to say it is much improved from the old design. I'm also pleased they offered to send my a new bulb free of charge to try. Thats good customer service! First off the height of the bulb is now normal. It will not stick out of the fixture you place it in, like the old bulb did. The bulb looks exactly like what they have in the current pictures. I measured the new bulb as consuming 3.9 watts, which is more efficient than the old model (4.4 watts) and the same as my old favorite, the G7. The new bulb is a lot brighter too. I measured it at 5100 lux @ 1 foot away, compared to the old model @3860 lux. Its still not as bright as the old G7 at 7200 lux. But its acceptable. It comes on instantly and has a fairly linear dimming ability with a standard Lutron dimmer. It does have a little bit of yellow fringing at 1 foot away, but over several feet onto my dark brown granite countertop, it was mostly unnoticeable. Since the G7 is not available now, I would not hesitate to give this bulb a try. G7 however has redesigned their GU10 style bulb and it should be available soon. I always prefer products made in the USA, like the G7. I'm pretty sure this HitLights is still made in China.",4.0,0

"Just switched my cat to this food and he really likes it. He's eating it more than the Purina One Beyond he upgraded from. The vet suggested to give him Innova Evo or Blue Buffalo which are both excellent foods but he didn't like them and he actually dropped down to 9.5 lbs. He's slowly gained weight back after switching to Purina One Beyond but I wanted to buy something that was a great quality food rather than the supermarket junk he likes. Purina One Beyond is better quality than Friskies or something but still not the quality I want my pets to eat.

He is now 10.6 lbs and rising so I'm hoping that he'll eventually get up to the 12 lbs that the vet wanted him at to be ideal weight (he's a large breed cat).

Price was $3 more expensive than the Purina, so he gets a 5 star food at a great price!

"Should really have been called ""The Men from UNCLE before they became the Men from UNCLE"" because this is actually the run-up period to the creation of the United Network Command for Law and Enforcement. So if you're hoping to see the UNCLE HQ and hear ""Open Channel D"" then you are going to be slightly disappointed.

Nevertheless this is a great film. The story is far superior to any James Bond movie and the characters are necessarily brought up-to-date (I saw an original TV episode and it was stunningly cheesy and out-dated). Some of the photography is highly innovative and there is a considerable injection of humor throughout the movie. Overall it had the right feel for a Man from UNCLE film without being ridiculously trapped in the past.

Cavill nails Napoleon Solo but Arnie Hammer struggles to reinvent the original Kuryakin character. Overall I'm okay with his performance but really there is no substitute for David McCallum. Truth is, his assignment was unenviable.

"The prduct description for these toys says they are ""ecologically responsible"".  I personally don't think killing animals for leather is an ecologically responsible action.  If you love your pets enough to buy them lots of nice toys, then you're an animal lover like myself.  If you love animals as much as I do, then you're probably a vegetarian and don't use animal products like leather.  When I purchased these cat toys I was not aware that they were made with leather because the product description omits this detail.  As soon as I opened the box from Amazon and saw the genuine leather fish heads I was absolutely furious!  Why on earth would I want one animal to suffer - a cow used for its hide - so that I can provide a play toy for another animal - my cat?  I would never kill a cat to use its hide to make a toy for a cow!!

I did end up keeping the toys because I didn't want to deal with returning them - which would also be ecologically irresponsible with the resources going in to the shipping process.  Also, one of my cats absolutely loves feather toys which was the main reason I purchased these in the first place, so I gave him the fishies and he loves them.  They aren't the most popular toys in the kitty basket, but they haven't gone unused.  If my cats are really hyper and I toss the fishies in the air for them they will go after them, but if the toys are just laying there the cats don't go up to them and start playing with them.

"Outstanding product -- I needed a place to feed my skinny cats at their leisure, feed my handicapped kitten, and keep my fat cat on a diet. This works GREAT -- skinny cats love to play all over and jump up to the top house to feed when they are hungry; fat cat has a food timer next to the whole setup to feed her limited diet: she can't jump up and too fat to really want to go into the small house below, and the handicapped kitten gets fed canned food on the first level (she's learning where the food is still). Great solid product... it's rather large (we put in the basement - works out great), easy to put together, If you are a real cat lover - this is definitely a good investment. I have house rabbits too, and once things are set up for them near this condo - I think they will enjoy jumping on it and in the houses.

The fleece covering I'm sure will have to be replaced at some point - its not the highest quality: this is my only ""complaint"" if you can call it that,  but it's good enough. The product came quickly and fully intact.",5.0,0

"There's 14 of these now so people should know that THESE ARE NOT TRADITIONAL ANIMATION.  If you go in expecting the 90's X-men cartoon you will be very disappointed.  This is merely a limited animation rendering of the artwork with music and voice acting.  In this case it's pretty well done and I personally think they are getting better as they go on.

This one is a lot more ambitious then the prior installments in terms of action.  I originally thought this would be another Wolverine story but it does a good job at show casing a range of characters.  I enjoyed the Terminator by way of super heroes plus some Robocop for good measure story even if Jason Aaron can be hit or miss with me.  The voice acting is improving as well and I've come to accept Brian Drummond as a pretty good Wolverine.  Besides he's Canadian so he's a shoe in.

It was cool to see a rather under used character like Deathlok get show cased.  I hope Marvel Knights starts to move more in this direction as they continue.  Also surprised they couldn't interview Aaron for this.  Made the special feature seem less interesting.

Another complaint is I didn't think it was made clear that the Deathlok internalizing is supposed to be the same one every time.  With that little bit of spoiler free information the whole thing makes a lot more sense.  They still don't explain him that well though or why he has Wolverine claws and an Ironman hand.

Anyway let's see some more.  Ghost Rider, Moon Knight, Iron Fist, Dr. Strange, Hawkeye, who is next?",4.0,0

"I prefer realism over Hollywood story telling.  This film is a great ""Popcorn"" type of War Movie, that in a way reminds me of the old 40's war movies.  The plot centers around a tank crew led by Brad Pitt's character ""WarDaddy""  (right away, when I see a War film with the characters all having nicknames, I know I am in for less than realism and more Hollywoodism).

There's a lot to like about this film.  It is entertaining, the sound effects are awesome (LOVE LOVE LOVE the .50 cal firing), there's suspense, tension, and afront to innocence brought into a combat scenario.

The tactics, movement, command and control structure, and even discipline are all Hollywood screen writers (by that I mean, they are not realistic, but written for the screen to be entertaining).  The combat is intense, although a bit too contrived.  I think actual combat would've seen the engagements they depict not turn out as depicted.

Still, I feel this film is worthy of 4 stars (the only reason I didn't go 5 is because of the realism factor)... I don't feel at all like I wasted my money.

I haven't addressed a story synopsis or plot lines because, to be quite honest, I don't want to spoil your viewing (if you've not seen it), and if you have, you know those speak for themselves.

I highly recommend this film if you're looking for a really really good war film that will keep you on the edge of your seat.  Just don't expect the same level of immersion as other films, such as Platoon, or Saving Pvt. Ryan...  I don't think that was the filmakers' aim in making this.",4.0,0

"Our 3 year old golden retriever has softer fur, unlike our female whose coat is shinier and sleeker, so he tends to need to be bathed on a weekly basis to keep him smelling fresh and clean. He's like a little boy, he loves to explore and especially loves to jump in every puddle, pond, any body of water he sees basically which leaves his fur smelling what can best be described as fishy so I'm always looking for a great shampoo that won't irritate his sensitive skin.  This medicated dog shampoo has done absolute wonders for the dry, flaky skin both our goldens have on their front elbows.  We had tried creams, sprays, even oral meds but nothing was helping but since we started using this the skin has softened and fur is growing back and they are no longer scratching themselves to death, thrilled with the results, highly recommend.  This item was supplied to me at no cost during a promotion by the seller in order to evaluate and share my experience. All opinions are 100% my own and they reflect my honest & unbiased opinion.

"Strangers With Candy is a perfect send-up of insipid topical  teen shows like My So-Called Life and the After School Specials that spewed conformist propoganda into the ears and eyes of America's youth every weekday afternoon during the 1980's.  I remember watching it back when I had cable, as well as a slew of other top-notch shows that were on Comedy Central at the time (Upright Citizens Brigade, The Daily Show, South Park, T.V. Funhouse etc...).  Strangers With Candy may not have been the best of these shows, or even the edgiest, but it very well may have been the darkest.  South Park and T.V. Funhouse were/are certainly caustic and dark, but 'Strangers' was pitch black.  This humor is truly without reverence.  Nothing is sacred, all is petty, and the mere concept of morality itself becomes the joke.

Comedy Central is truly a great network.  Whenever possible, complete creative freedom is given to (gasp!) the CREATORS of the show.  Strangers With Candy certainly benefitted from this policy; its vision is clearly uncompromised.  Every aspect of the production contributes to a consistent representation of a unified concept.

I recently rented the first and second seasons and the latter is the better of the two.  I am looking forward to renting the third season.  If you are a fan of black comedy, Strangers With Candy will tickle your funny bone - and then break it.",5.0,0

The plastic part on the back is very thin and it does not hold up well to the biting. This is a very thin plastic with no edge. I have to leave it on the floor and it goes out of the way. I would recommend this product to anyone who is considering purchasing this product. This is a great product for dogs that need to be chewed up, but they can't chew it up!  This is a great product for dogs that have chewed it up too. We bought this for a puppy that had chewed up a huge chunk of his front teeth. It's a bit flimsy, but it's sturdy enough to keep him from chewing on it. It's a bit on the smaller side for the size of a small dog. It's a little stiff for a small dog, but it's worth it for her to chew on it. The only downside is that it's not very easy to clean, and I find that it doesn't hold up well for her to chew on.

"In 1988, British ITV did a documentary called ""The Burgh"" on the Burgh, the infamous British army camp in Iraq. The Burgh is the most infamous camp in the world today. The Burgh is in fact a fictional story about the soldiers and their families. The documentary also includes a behind the scenes look at the Burgh and how the Army came to be involved in it.

The documentary also includes a brief interview with British author and critic Michael Wilbon. Wilbon talks about his work on the Burgh, and how he created the Burgh.

The documentary also includes a short documentary that covers some of the things that went into making the film, and some of the questions that Wilbon has raised in the documentary.

The documentary also includes a brief interview with British film director Alan Richardson, who was also a director of ""The Burgh"". Richardson talks about the reasons that the Burgh was created, and the reasons why they were chosen to make it.

The documentary also includes a trailer for the documentary, which you can see in the trailer. This documentary is not for the faint of heart, as it is very long, and it covers a lot of things that have been said about the Burgh.

It was an interesting ending, and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to see a good Christian film.This is a great movie.  It has a lot of action, great characters, a good story and great acting.  I was very impressed with this movie.  The acting is amazing and I can watch it over and over again.

"While Case intends their knives to be pocketknives, they have the quality and look of a fine collectable. The Stockman model gives you 3 good blades of varying size and shape.  The large version weighs an ounce and a half more than the medium size and is 5/8 of an inch longer.  The additional size and weight can pull your pocket out of shape.  The amber bone  has an excellent hand feel and is a joy to hold. The blades are very sharp. Stainless steel will require less care to keep rust away but still hold a good edge.
A Case knife is a possession to be treasured that will be with you for years. Case is an investment in a quality knife that will become a life-long friend.

I have a little smaller dog, so it was a challenge to fit him properly. The material is soft and plush, so I can't say I am impressed.

I have had many jobs where I have had to replace a tool that has had to be replaced for many years.

I don't want to have to replace a tool that I have used and to have to replace it for years to come. I like the fact that I can change out a tool with no hassle.

"I'm amazed at how many people love this movie.  I can tell a lot of money was spent to make this movie, and acting was good but the story struck me as overly dramatic and uneven.  I'm glad the library saved me my money on this DVD.  I'll skip viewing the second disc.

Based on J.G. Ballard's novel, I think the late Roger Ebert summed it up nicely when he wrote:

""The movie's general lack of direction leads to what seems like a series of possible endings; having little clear idea of where he was going, Spielberg isn't sure if he has arrived there. The movie's weakness is a lack of a strong narrative pull from beginning to end. The whole central section is basically just episodic daily prison life and the dreams of the boy. Empire of the Sun adds up to a promising idea, a carefully observed production and some interesting performances. But despite the emotional potential in the story, it didn't much move me.""

If you want to know what really happened read this passage from Ballard's autobiography Miracles of Life:  ""For me, the most important consequence of internment was that for the first time in my life I was extremely close to my parents. I slept, ate, dressed and undressed within a few feet of them in the same small room, in many ways like the poorer Chinese families for whom I had felt so sorry in Shanghai. But I revelled in this closeness. Lying in bed at night I could, if I wanted to, reach out and take my mother's hand. I flourished in this intimacy, such a contrast to formal English life.""

"When I saw this DVD I thought it might be good with Penn directing and the cast, but now I can see why I do not recall seeing its trailer at a theatre or on my tv screen....
The dialogue is badly muddled some of the time.....e.g. when Frank and Joe are alone on the porch of their old farm and running around in the corn field......Another instance is when Joe goes to the bar to see why Frank is not at home where his child is being born.
There is also a tendency to leave things hanging.....
I found it a waste of some talented actors e.g. Bronson, Hopper, Denis and others, but admit that it is probably the best thing that Morse has ever done on the big screen...normally he walks thru his roles like a zombie.
I found Mortensen's character, Frank, to be sad and compelling, but the others were fleeting in time and depth.
Finally, are we to believe that after Frank beats the bartender to death, that his brother, a dedicated police officer, just sighs and tells us that he never saw him again?

Finally!! This leash is a God send for my high energy but super shy rescue pup. He can run like crazy and play fetch without even knowing hes on lead. I also found out how far away he can be from me and still feel secure. Overall I end up with a relaxed and happy dog that is so much calmer and easier to train. Its also a lot of fun to watch him be able to get all his energy out safely. I like the bright orange one so people can see Im still in control and I don't have a dog running around free.,5.0,0

"Hey folks, some of you have complained about not being able to get your hand into the disposal to pull things out.  Guess what -- that's a very intentional design measure to protect you by keeping you from putting hands where they don't belong.  If the beast can grind up beef bones, guess what it will do to your hand!!!!  Maybe you think the disposal is safe when turned off, but so have people who considered a gun as safe when they didn't realize if was loaded.  It would be nice if the design didn't have to deal with abuse, misuse and stupidity -- but unfortunately it does.  Don't make yourself a victim.

The booties are very well packaged in separate cylinder bundles. This is convenient so you can keep in attractive containers by the door, ready to be used by your guests. The little bundles themselves come in a plastic bag, nothing fancy.

I probably should give this 5 stars because my Cockatiel ADORES this toy. These are her favorite. I got her in June and I have already ordered 3 of them. She loves ripping them apart and they are the only toy she really shows interest in at all. They also are just the size I was looking for to hang under a rope perch on the top of her cage where I've designed her a little play area. I use the perch as sort of a bridge and this toy is short enough to hang underneath and not touch the cage so she can swing it around and chew it up. I wish I could find them locally because the reason I gave it four stars was the 2nd time I ordered I ordered two since she tears them up so quickly and one came just fine but the other one was missing pieces one of the wicker balls was just in pieces in the bottom of the box and a couple pieces of the colored wood were laying in the box as well. She already tears them up pretty quickly and having it already missing pieces definitely makes it last even less time. It was aggravating to me because the toys came in a box from Amazon with other items I had ordered at the same time and all were individually packaged within the cardboard box except these two toys which were just thrown in with nothing but a tag saying Super Bird Creations. No bag around them no cardboard nothing just thrown in the bottom of the box and the one was damaged. It is still a good toy though and your bird will love it just be prepared to buy them in bulk ;),4.0,0

He plays the pilot at the controls of this 1972 suspense drama, one of the many disaster films (or ""multi-jeopardy"" films, as Heston liked to call them) made during the 1970s.  James Brolin is excellent as the seemingly all-American army man who orders Heston's plane to be flown into Russia.  John Guillermin's direction is pretty good, and there isn't all that much melodrama like we see in many other such movies.

"I am happy with the Breeze cat box system, however it is taking some adjustment as we have 6 cats, (all rescues). Most of them get along well, as 4 of them are related, so I have luckily been able to use less litterboxes than the experts suggest, (one more litter box than you have cats). My current house is smaller than our old one, so we had to go from 5 litter boxes to 3 boxes with clumping litter. I decided to change to this system in an attempt to be cleaner overall. Because of the 6 cats to 3 boxes, I do notice a particular odor from the urine. The cats are all spayed females. I think because this is new to me, I let the pad stay too long, and I was also used to using a litter additive to counteract odor. There is of course no tracked litter all over the floor, which is great, and it is very easy to clean. None of the cats have shown any problem with the change, (I did one box at a time). I now just need to figure out which pads need changing when, based on how many cats use a particular box to urinate in. So I believe it is simply an adjustment phase. I have a feeling I will be changing these pads every couple of days, but as I said, we have 3 boxes for 6 cats. Overall I am happy with this system. I did notice that the Japanese have the same product offered with a dome cover, which would be nice. This system makes the most sense of any I have seen so far.",5.0,0

I (very carefully) drilled out the existing screw holes to accommodate the mlok size screws so that I could directly attach it extremely securely to my MI handguard.

"While this film ostensibly is based on an American novel, its plot and themes seem stolen from ""Martin Fierro,""  a 19th century Argentine epic gaucho poem.  There are plenty of beautiful landscapes and scenes of stampeding cattle to keep you visually entertained---in addition to pretty Gene Tierney and hubba-hubba-hubba Rory Calhoun.  Both wander around through part of the film with strategically torn tops that chastely communicate ""come hither.""  Calhoun is wooden as befits his role, and Tierney just sits, stands, and faints throughout the film, looking Gene Tierneyesque but not having much to do. Hugh Marlowe of ""All About Eve"" fame offers a lot of platitudinous talk of ""progress"", of the end of the barbarous life of the gauchos when confronted by the forces of the city (i.e.civilization).  This is a motif of Argentine history and a standard of Western fare.  See the flick and chalk if off as a Western set in the Southern Hemisphere.",3.0,0

"This is perhaps my least favorite collection of Sansone workouts. Along with a handful of old LS tapes, I have Leslie's '5-Day Fit Walk'....which I really like....and 'Ultimate Collection' (yet to do all the routines).

'Muscle Mile One' is your basic one mile. '30 Minute Walk' (also on '5-Day Fit Walk') is good. When I need a fairly gentle workout and want a cast of very real people (not Leslie's fellow instructors or a group of the familiar faces) 'Walk Diet One Mile' suffices (no production value here). 'Walk Strong Express' is my fave on this DVD. Challenging and makes for a nice change with the interval training (and the participants using different kinds of weights).

In search of variety and options beyond the basic four LS moves I was interested in 'You Can Do Pilates.' I'm not familiar with her solo offering by the same name, which has a slightly longer run time, so it may afford more in the way of instruction. Were it not for the fact I have some knowledge of Pilates this would be way too confusing. It lacks detailed breathing and body positioning cues, and, in my opinion, presumes the participant has an intermediate skill level.(As a Boomer, my Pilates faves are Carol Argo's 'Anti-Aging Method' and Maggie Rhoades' 'Pilates Complete for Inflexible People.')

As with some of the other 'collections' the music of these older workouts....upon which I rely to keep me moving and in sync with the workout...is weak much of the time. The sound quality from one workout to another lacks consistency, as well. Given my other LS workout options, this one is rarely in the rotation.",3.0,0

I didn't expect much since they're cheap, and have the appearance of an economy grade cover. Anyway, I was pleasantly surprised. When I finally ran out (who thinks about buying roller covers from Amazon) and couldn't find more at my local hardware store or home center, I bought others made by Purdy, Shur-Line and other well-known brands. None were ever as good as these. Purdy makes excellent paint brushes, but their rollers are merely OK and tend to make bubbles. Shur-Line makes excellent edgers but I never used any of their covers that didn't shed. Even Shur-Line's most expensive, top of the line ""premium select"" roller covers with their ""shed resistant technology"" shed badly. It's not the paint - I only buy Benjamin Moore and it's about $65 a gallon these days. They even tolerate cleaning well, if you want to you can get two or three uses out of a cover, but at this price why bother?

So after failing to find anything better, I bought another set of these Wooster covers from Amazon. Once again I am pleased. They hold paint well, don't leave bubbles, and absolutely do not shed. They're better than ones I've paid three times as much for.",5.0,0

"My last Rottweiler, Jet, was a little too big for him.  We tried a variety of pet bedding and we had to get a larger one for him.  After a lot of research we decided to try this one.  We were skeptical about the size of the bedding but we were a bit surprised at how well it worked.  It's a bit big for him but it's just right.  It's a nice size for a large dog.

We have a small dog that is about 1 1/2 inches tall, so he was a bit small for this bedding.  It's definitely a bit large for him.  We have to get the bedding from the fabric and we have to get it off the dog.  It's also a little heavier for him than other beds we have.

It's a nice size for a small dog.  We've had this bedding for about a year and it's still in good condition.  It's a little tight on the dogs neck but it's not too tight for the large dog.  The material is very soft and it's easy to tear off.  I've used it on my dogs all over the house and it looks nice and it's a little big for them.

We were both very excited to see the movie based on the previews we had seen & our love for animated movies...

This movie will NOT disappoint you! It was an absolute GEM of a movie!!!
Although we saw it in 2d, it was visually STIMULATING, with STUNNING effects, action sequences & characters!!!
All the characters, scenery, and animation were Simply AMAZING!!!
Not too mention the voices of all the characters were a perfect fit & each voice over was clear and accurately defined!

Now for the story...
It was a well written story with built in Humor, loyalty, friendship and love!
A story that kids of all ages & adults could follow & believe in!

There is something in this movie for Everyone that watches it:)

If you have children, take them to see this movie ASAP... it is the perfect time of year, and will add to the Holiday Spirit...
If your child, ask your Parent or Parents to take you to this movie...
If your an adult, go see this movie... it will most likely bring back fond memories and you will leave the theater fulfilled!!!

"Well I've had this installed for a few months. Ended up purchasing 6 more dimmers. The HomeKit interface is great. The overall quality has met my expectations for the current products on the market. My biggest tangible complaint is the wall switches have a cheap feel. The remotes feel more sturdy and less wobbly when you press the buttons. The app works well on the iPhone and watch. Siri is a bonus but Apple needs to work on their side of the integration a little more. Most of the time I can use Siri quickly for dimming or turning the lights on. The app needs some improvement with the geo location. I added my girlfriend to the app. However, I have the app programmed to turn the lights off when I leave. If my girlfriend is home it still turns them off. Not big deal but this would be a pain if you have a big family. You can easily turn this feature off if you don't like it.

The killer is then sent to a remote place in Siberia where he is forced to live in a cage, where he is forced to kill some people. The killing of a woman is a crime, and it is the last straw for Walker. He has to kill one person before he can be able to go to the remote location and get his revenge.

Love this light. My neighbor was so impressed that he is buying some also. We like the spread of the flood light. We have many oak trees and the light disperses from the ground to well into the top of the tree and just as Impressive width wise. If you are looking for a spot beam this is not for you. But if you want to cove a wide area I do recommend this unit. I also like the output of the daylight version better than the warm white version.,5.0,0

"""The Terminator"" directed by the brilliant James Cameron, is the most thought-provoking motion picture of the 1980's. What if computers controlled the world? Well, in 1984, a man named Kyle Reese and a terminator were sent to kill the mother of the rebel leader of the future. Sarah Connor supposedly gives birth to the leader of human resistance to the machines and his name is John Connor. The man was sent to protect her and the machine was sent to  change the course of time. Arnold Schwarzenegger is the ultimate mechanism that has no feeling and no heart! How frosty! It's the fight of a lifetime between the man and the machine, but unfortunately, the man loses. After many deaths fulfilled by the terminator, Sarah Connor crushes it. I was so perturbed with the extermination of Arnold, I turned it off right then. Arnold should never die in a movie. Good thing Hollywood made the best sequel to have ever hit the big screen to explain themselves.",5.0,0

"You know, I've been a fan of these Paranormal Activity movies since it debuted a few years ago. The first and second movies were pretty decent, although you can tell they were made on a low-budget. The first two relied more on getting to know the characters and heavily on very slow-building tension, which is why I loved them so much. That makes me wonder why this one just went off-track. PA3 is, quite literally, a weak mess of a movie. You'd think these guys would up the wow factor of this movie, considering how the first two were, but no. I know they were trying to tell the backstory to the series but they could do that and still wow us. The acting was very dry and that made it unbelievable to me. I mean, the knockoff movie:Paranormal Entity, was way better than this one. I was really disappointed and just can't recommend anyone buy this movie. If you can find it in a bargain bin somewheres, okay-maybe then. But for full asking price-No. These guys better get their game on in the next movie or fans are going to jump ship, plain and simple.",2.0,0

"WEAK ON CURRENT SCIENCE.
After seeing it twice, I agree with much (but not all) of the positive five star reviews. Out of respect for those who READ reviews, I'll not repeat everything that I like about the presentation. I found the goofy oversize earrings, hairdo, and facial hair arrangement of Daniel Vitalis, (described as a ""Wild Food Expert"") distracting. UGH. Ditto for David Wolfe, who had an extremely goofy wild hairdo. On the other hand, Jon Gabriel, described as an ""author and weight loss expert"" was nicely groomed and a good presenter. His story of personal transformation of a fellow of over 400 pounds (whew) to becoming a jock of normal weight was inspiring. Christiane Northrup preserves her rank as one of America's cutest doctors. A really nice looking woman! Presentations by Dr. Mercola, Jason Vale, Kris Carr, Alejandro Junger were fine. It was disappointing to have Jamie Oliver (so popular in the UK) give Baby Cow Growth Fluid a pass with unscientific but popular ideas on milk. None of the presenters had anything (ZILCH) to say about the work of Doctor T. Colin Campbell. Milk does a body bad. It was good to see all presenters take a stand against sugar. They all agreed on the evils of sugar and refined carbohydrates. With all respect to Dr. Northrup, her ""It's not fat that makes you fat - it's sugar"" statement will not pass muster in the community of experts. Recognizing the evils of sugar should NOT be mutually exclusive to recognizing the proven dangers of fat - particularly fat from dead animals - and EXTRACTED fat of ALL kinds. Olive Oil is NOT a health food.

"""First Blood"" has to be, without a doubt, one of my favorite action films of all time. I believe that I enjoy it so much because it does a nice job of balancing action scenes with drama. Thus, this film does not reek of the overkill violence that plagues the two sequels (as well as the films of other action stars). Stallone actually does some acting in this film. His performance as a Vietnam Vet come home to find a thankless country is compelling and his emotional breakdown near the end of the film is fantastic. There is a lot of suspense in this film and the characters are certainly memorable. Rambo has a clear enemy in this film, played by Brian Dennehy. He is not taking on the country of Vietnam or the Russians-he is simply defending himself from a small-town cop. My recommendation is to see this film and forget about the two sequels. Of course, any die-hard Rambo fan will tell you that the action sequences only become better as the movies progressed, but they sacrifice much to do this in my opinion. If you enjoy action films with a little class, you'll love ""First Blood.",4.0,0

He's a little hard to keep clean, but he loves this.  We use this on our cat and he doesn't seem to mind it.  It works great.  It's not a miracle formula, but it's good for him.  He'll go to the vet for a checkup if he hears the bell sound, and the vet will tell you the formula is good for him.  He's a very picky eater, and he doesn't want to eat anything that he doesn't like, so I'm giving this a try.  It seems to be working well, and he's a bit more flexible, so we can't be too strict.My dog loves this toy.  I put him through his paces in the sandbox and have never seen him",4.0,1

"I simply can't understand the vitriol that has been heaped on this movie.  I didn't see Alexander in the theatre, so my only experience with it is the director's cut DVD, which I thoroughly enjoyed.  Oliver Stone brought Alexander and his times to life for me, and Colin Farrell did an excellent job putting a human face on a man who thought he was a god.  Don't be put off by the jabs of spoiled movie critics - watch this lavish and engrossing film, and enjoy!

The only flaw I saw with the film - and it may be an insurmountable one - is that so much went on in Alexander's life, that it is probably impossible to present it all in a single movie.  Stone gives us a glimpse into the political, military, and personal aspects of Alexander's story, and these really can't be fully appreciated unless one has first familiarized oneself by reading the various accounts of Alexander, especially those written by his ancient biographers.  I may be reading too much into it, but I think the central theme of the Stone film is given us when, on Alexander's wedding night, he responds to his new bride""s question about whether he loves Hephaestion by saying, ""There are many kinds of love, Roxane.""  Oliver Stone's Alexander has many loves - his father, his mother, Hephaestion, Bagoas, the army, glory, war, his vision of a united world empire - and his attempts to give full devotion to each one drive his extraordinary career and, it would seem, eventually lead to his own self-destruction.",4.0,0

"I wish there was not an end to the ""Twilight"" saga.  This was the best series that I have seen by far.  I also feel this series followed the books closely and tried to put in as many aspects as possible.  My boyfriend and I went to see ""Breaking Dawn Part 2"" together in theaters.  He is not as into the saga as I am, he just goes with because I make him.  He enjoyed the crowd more than the movie.  He laughed at the crowd's reaction to Alice's vision. He said you could hear everyone sigh with relief.  I think this movie was great.  It always kept you on your toes, never knowing what to expect next.  After seeing this video in theaters I was extremely confused.  I loved how the movie took you off course, but I had a hard time keeping track of who was killed.  I was almost in tears seeing everyone get killed.  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  This is one where I could watch it over and over and never get sick of it.  ""Breaking Dawn Part 2"" was the perfect ending to the story.  Knowing that Bella and Edward can finally live in happiness and peace together is elating.  I would highly recommend the entire series.

I think the Delta would be harder to assemble if you didn't already have a drill press or some similar means of drilling a perfectly squared hole.  The rolling action of both is pretty comparable.

While I really like the bulb I wish the company had included instructions and other elements about the life and uses just in case there would be other uses or functions that I have yet to encounter.  About the only extra information included is that the lamp is dimmable and it has a 3 year 25,000 hour warranty.  If it were to break in less than 3 years I would not know what to do.

"Buying an 18v drill a few years ago after doing much research I concluded that a Ryobi would suit me fine, but I have since tore the internals up.  This Milwaukee 2601 is smaller, lighter and better built.  The specs said it has more torque but I wondered if I would be able to tell the difference.  Absolutely.  I could more or less controll the Ryobi if the bit ever got stuck, but this one will twist your wrist right off.  I have to use much less effort in both drilling and driving applications, this drill does all the work.
  This milwaukee is the best in the class of compact drills with compact batteries.  This drill is a most excellent and capable tool.  It has the shortest head length of any 18v drill, it will bring 18v power to places others just can't fit.  While not being the lightest, it is the lightest to have all metal gears.  The battery lasts quite well for anything you shouldn't be using a full size maybe even hammer drill for.  A 30 min recharge time on the battery isn't the quickest, but not doing it too quickly most likely extends the battery's life.

  As to some other reviews, when considering a drill, be smart about it. Get the right tool for what you're going to be doing with it.  For anyone considering this drill, if you want a lightweight, compact yet powerful drill to reach for everytime and anytime a hammer drill isn't required, this is it.  You aren't going to be breaking into a concrete bunker with it, and it's overkill for hanging a picture but it will handle just about everything in-between.",5.0,0

I do not know why bulbs with this type of bayonet connector are priced less than the screw-in type, but with using these adapters, your purchases of the GU10 bulbs will be less (usually) than buying bulbs with the regular type base. You'll add about an inch overall to the height (or would that be length) of what the GU10 bulb would be if it were affixed into a bayonet base style socket. But for the most part GU10 bulbs are much shorter than their regular base counterparts - so not a prob.

I'm thinking that you'll recoup your $$$ using these for the very first time (not to mention how much you'll save on electricity if you switch to LED bulbs).",5.0,0
"We have it on our balcony at the far end. We leave the door open, because the air in Los Angeles is toxic and prevents flying critters from existing long enough to fly into our apartment. Our dog knows that if he has to go, that's the place to do it. He knew, instinctively what it was for, probably because it's very similar to grass. Have had it for a couple of months and washed it several times. It's held together very well, and am so happy I spent the money. Game changer for having a dog. No more house accidents. Well once, but he was just trying to get attention.",5.0,0

"I installed this thermostat on a single stage Water Furnace geothermal unit.  Despite a minor glitch in the beginning it has been running very well.  When I first installed it there was a firmware issue that shut my unit down and led to a very cold morning, but customer service was great and they updated the firmware over the phone.  I do wish the thermostat came with more technical details as I still had multiple questions that were not covered in the manual, once again customer service was great in answering them.  My goal in installing this unit was to eliminate my electric backup heat from kicking on in cold weather.  It has succeeded in doing this.  It can be -10 degrees out and my geothermal unit will not need the backup.  It does run longer but it is still more cost effective than paying for the electric heat.  I like how it learns how long it takes your house to heat up or cool down and then automatically adjusts the run times to have the house at the correct temperature by the time you want it.  Having a geothermal unit is a lot different than a regular heating system as it cannot handle large swings in temperature especially in heating mode.  I have my house set to 65 in the day and 63 at night / away.  That's about the biggest swing my geothermal unit can handle.  Even with this small swing in temperature I am noticing lower electric bills by about $30 a month.  I love the computer interface for programming it and the graphs that show you detailed usage reports and data.",5.0,0

"This thing is the bomb!! Easy to use (with two people), and does the trick thoroughly. My vent was super clogged (and I knew that going in to the cleaning process). We proceeded slowly, doing only the top ten feet first, then proceeding down to the next sections. So, we probably lowered it down a total of 5 times. We used cell phones to communicate with each other. The person on the roof lowers the hose down (with the air flow off), then turns on the air flow and slowly pulls the hose up. Pounds of lint came out with each pass. It helps to loosely cover the lower vent opening with a bag (or pillowcase) when the air is switched on, to save from a big mess inside the laundry room. When the hose finally makes it down to the lower opening, and the air is turned on, a nasty blast of lint will come out of the end (as it should), but nothing like what comes out of the top of the vent. The direction of the blast coming out of the ball on the end of the hose systematically keeps the lint rolling upward and outward. There was nothing left in my dryer vent after the last pass. My clothes dry TWICE as fast as they used to.",5.0,0

"""Beyond Borders"" was originally to be an animated movie, but was cancelled after only a year.  The story was not very good, but it was still fun to watch.  I enjoyed this movie.  It is a good film, and one I would watch again.The series was cancelled by a network after a season ended.  I had to wait a year for the new season.  I watched the new season on Netflix and decided to give it another shot.  I'm glad I did.  It's the best show ever.  This is a must have!

You will be glad you did!  A must have for any fan of the show.  I'm glad I gave it to a friend.I loved this movie. It was a good movie and I was impressed with the story. It was not the best of the bunch. I think the fact that it was not filmed in a location that I thought was a good location was a good thing. This movie is about a good guy, but he is always doing something bad. The movie was fun to watch, but was a bit long and the acting was not very good. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes good movies.I'm not a big fan of the old ""The Sting"" films, so I watched them for the first time on DVD with my 4 year old.

Make no mistake, Tom Naughton is super smart as well as funny, and he has solicited the help of some of the best minds in the field of nutrition and medicine to show the public where Morgan Spurlock went horribly wrong in his conclusions.

"This has become an essential tool to restraining my ever growing labrador. She is not out of control by any means, she just gets very excited about her walks and has a very powerful 4 wheel drive system that I cannot compete with.  She was also pulling hard enough that she was choking herself.  The choke collar would be counter productive in those terms, so decided to go with the pinch collar.  We tried a harness, but that only let her pull harder.  I was about to send her to Alaska to become a sled dog. Just kidding, we just need some time to work through it.

The first day I put this on she pushed the limits and yelped a couple times.  Since then, she has learned to respect the collar and we have not had any issues since.  She only goes to the end of the leash and lightly tugs at moments where she is really excited to meet another dog, while still respecting the collar.  Otherwise she has learned to leave some slack in the leash which is comfortable for both of us.  This product has made our walking experience infinitely more pleasurable.  I highly recommend.",5.0,0

"I got the 3-pack and put one of them in an old torchiere floor lamp I had sitting around and the other two in my garage. The floor lamp had been pretty much useless because it was rated for a 60 watt bulb and I needed more illumination in my living room than that, I put in a couple of sets of halogen track lights years ago and I hadn't even bothered turning it on since. These actually only consume 11 watts, making it safe to use them in the lamp so now I get to use a 100 watt equivalent bulb.

But wait, there's more. I did a little informal comparison between this bulb and some other lights and I think that it's a little better than two 60 watt soft white bulbs when it comes to lighting up my room, and it's just as good as one of the halogen track light units. My family agrees with me on this; so, while it's hardly a scientific analysis, practically speaking, it'll do. (I think the main reason is that daylight spectrum reflects better off the white walls and ceiling than soft white.) It's also way cheaper to operate. I also prefer them in the garage to the soft white bulbs they replaced. They do cost a bit more up front than halogens, and quite a bit more than incandescents but with a much longer life and a small fraction of the cost to operate them I think they're an excellent purchase.",5.0,0

I thoroughly enjoyed this Poe-twist story line.  It gave some detail in the beginning of the movie (his anguish, tormented life), to keep you hooked to the end.

"Lifeboat (Alfred Hitchcock, 1944)

You take a John Steinbeck story, have Jo Swerling (Pennies from Heaven) adapt it, and get Alfred Hitchcock to direct, with a cast including Tallulah Bankhead, William Bendix, Hume Cronyn, Henry Hull, and Walter Slezak, among others. How can you not have a hit?

Lifeboat is a simple tale: a ship has gone down, torpedoed by a German U-Boat that was destroyed soon after. A number of survivors struggle to a lifeboat, one of whom is a crewman from the U-Boat. Second-guessing, paranoia, and power struggles ensue. The best thing to do: get out of the way. And that's pretty much what Hitchcock does; each of these characters is invested with a distinct, well-drawn personality, and given the situation, they're bound to clash on their own. Change a camera angle here and there, perhaps, but let the characters do their thing. There's a minimal plot (regarding, of course, the eeeeeeeeevil German-- let's remember this film was released during the darkest days of World War II), but this is a movie that's really about these characters and how they interact with one another. And it's fascinating.",4.0,0

"Barbet Schroeder is a very talented director. His main concerns have always been related with the dark side of the human soul.

This singular movie is a very careful analysis of the human psyche seen under a prism. Schroeder would have minutely followed the traces of ""The crime considered as one of the finest arts"" , the smart essay of Thomas de Quincey. Hitchcock, certainly inspired himself to make his famous movie: ""The Rope"".

But if you analyze the smart script with major intensity, you will find clever clues, like the first shot, in that enraptured camera movement that came into the hall window reminds us to: Psycho.

But there is still more, the well known mechanism of oppression and subjection between this weird couple is expressed with genuine fineness through expressive narrative ellipsis.

On the other hand we have to Sandra Bullock' s character who decides to investigate them through the night with a camera; which suggests us a modern Peeping Tom; I mean: James Stewart's role in ""The rear window"".

And finally we have the climatic sequence is another glorious tribute to ""Vertigo"". If you take into account all these hidden traces you will have to admit only Schroeder avoided this thriller had reached so higher peaks.

Perhaps, the only default of the movie resides in the limited scale of psychological grimaces of Sandra Bullock, but this is a minor failure in this intelligently unusual thriller.",4.0,0

I can therefore say with some measure of authority that it's not necessary to walk around topless or nude. Yes, birth is perfectly natural. So is sex, urination, and defecation. I'm not going to do any of those on screen.

2. I like home-birth because it feels so right, I have no other way to explain it. I'm a major advocate for home-birth, but what I can't stand is the ""movement"" associated with it. I do the home-birth because it's better for the child being born, the rest of the family, as well as myself (barring an emergency comes up, obviously). It's about mommy and baby, not ""empowerment"" and ""I am woman, hear me roar"". It's irritating and, in my opinion, it degrades women who choose to home-birth.",4.0,0

"I bought this because my sheltie is Houdini when it comes to getting out of collars and harnesses.  He's eight years old and this is the first harness he hasn't been able to work his magic on and get loose.

I didn't give it five stars because the sizing is a little screwy.  My sheltie weighs 35 pounds (he's a significantly larger than average sheltie), and he's right in between the small and medium size, and actually I bought both because I wasn't sure which one would fit.  I would have preferred to keep the medium as that fit him with some room to spare on the strap cinches, but the medium harness was too long, with the back strap almost touching his you know what on the underside, so I ended up keeping the small, even though the middle strap has to be almost fully loosened to go around his chest.  The other thing that's a minor inconvenience is that you have to pick up the dog's front leg and manually put it through the middle strap to get it on, because of the way the front strap and the middle strap are connected.  Not a big deal, unless your dog has an issue with you picking up one of it's legs to get this on.

I wish I had known about it before I bought it.It's an old fashioned, classy, and pretty. I love it. The color is a little too warm for my tastes.

"After one of my cats (Cats) died in two days.  He was a pretty healthy cat and had had a lot of health issues but the vet told me he was going to be a 50 lb. cat.  I was skeptical but he was fine.  The vet said if it's too small, the vet will tell me to try something else.  I got this for my other cat and it seems to work well.  I have a 60 lb. cat and it is a little too big for him.  I will definitely continue to try it out.  He has had it for a couple weeks and it seems to be doing great.

"This stuff seems to work.  We foster cats and ringworm is a constant problem as many feral cats carry the fungus and it is easily transmitted from cat to cat.  It is a bit expensive, but I cannot complain as it seems to work.  We applied it to a all white cat that had developed the classic ""bald"" spots and under black light glowed brightly.  As I applied the diluted product to the animal I notice strands of the fungus breaking away from the main body of the infestation!  I have never seen this before.  It has always taken 3 weeks or more to get the infestation down and for hair to start to grow back!  It is a tenacious fungus and infects humans as well!  It's not perfect and it is not an overnight cure.  After about two weeks, I can say the cat (kitten) is fungus free and suffered no ill effects.  We foster up to 15 kittens so it's a chore to isolate those cats with infestation from the others as the spores are airborne.  So it takes a lot of vacuuming, cleaning changing bedding and treatment to get control again.  If you have ringworm on a cat, give this a try.",4.0,0

"I had a Tekton mini bolt cutter, but this is much better.  The HK Porter has a maximum opening of nearly 1/2"" (7/16ths of an inch at the very top of the V opening) which means it opens more than twice as wide as the Tekton.  There is enough strength to cut through framing nails (.131"" or thereabouts) with little difficulty; wood screws cut like butter.  Also, while the Tekton has a flip-up wire catch at the bottom to hold the tool closed, the HKP has a slightly clumsy but perfectly effective thumb catch at the top, just below the cutter head - it works from either side, making the tool left- as well as right-handed.

The tool has a very comfortable soft plastic grip.  It feels solid and works effectively.  It does lack the Tekton's limiter screw.  It would not cut the only bolt I tried it on (neither does the Tekton), but scored it enough to guide an oscillating blade.",5.0,0

"My only recollection of the TV version of ""The Green Hornet"" is when they did a guest appearance on ""Batman"".  Robin(Burt Ward) fought Kato(Bruce Lee) to a draw(?!).  Kipnapped heiress Pinky Pinkston left an SOS for the Dynamic Duo in her alphabet soup.  The guest villain was the incomparable Roger C. Carmel as Colonel Gumm.  What does all this have to do with the price of tea in China?  Absolutely nothing but I figured I'd write some totally superfluous and extraneous remarks for the Hornet haters who'll get all over me for loving this movie.  I never read the comic books or saw the Tv series so I accept this movie for what it is and it's a total blast.  Star/writer/producer Seth Rogen took a character that is sacrosanct to many and fashioned it to fit his devil-may-care persona purists be damned.  The nocturnal adventures of the Hornet and Kato come off more as a fraternity pledge prank than as some altruistic endeavor and I thought that was a hoot.  What would Kevin Smith think?  Rogen is aces in my book but the real find is Jay Chou as Kato. Chou's Kato has a real alliance with the Hornet instead of just riding shotgun and displaying his karate moves.  Christoph Waltz extends his street cred that he established in ""Inglourious Basterds"" as the head of the Russian mob and he's as equally chilling and funny as he was in that movie.  James Franco has a terrific cameo as Waltz's ""competition"".  And how can you forget the cool cars and stunt work.  I love that Rogen took the material not too seriously but just serious enough.",5.0,0

"I bought this dog door 8 months ago and am on my fourth collar (for two dogs).  They are fragile and not designed well.  I don't know why they have the battery indicator light as the light works well past when the battery has enough juice to power the door signal, as far as I can tell.  When you open the case, the button often falls right out.

If you have two dogs, both have to have the water-resistant transmitter or both the non, because they have different signal strengths so one dog will be opening the door from 10' away while one will have to be right in front of it.

To get around having the silly second collar on the dog, I use the flimsy nylon strap to tie the transmitter to their real collar.  I like the zip tie idea better.

"I used the longer version to install a fairly heavy 60' wide headboard (about 50 lbs.) and even though the product feels very light-weight, it seems to hold the headboard securely and I have no concern about it falling.  It was easy to install, the included level was spot on (I double-checked it with my own longer level, and the multiple drilled holes made it easy to ensure that it was screwed into two studs.

The only concern I have is that in an earthquake, there's nothing to prevent the headboard from being dislodged from the track and landing on my head.  In a high-traffic area or with active children running around, you'd have the same risk of the item being jostled enough to do the same thing.  I've installed a shelf directly above the headboard, screwed into both the headboard and the wall, to prevent that, and if you didn't want to do that you could probably install braces above or below the hanging item to prevent upward movement.  But this problem is true of most methods of hanging heavy items on the wall, so it shouldn't be considered a defect in the product.

30 years can show a lot of age on some movies but Annie is a breath of fresh air for a catalog title. The films 2.40:1 framed production design and muted color scheme shines bright and clear with a beautiful restoration. The picture maintains a wonderful film-like appearance with a solid grain structure that maintains depth and detail without compromising black levels.

"If you don't recoil from the idea of a school teacher in charge of your children's education who smokes dope, lies, steals, manipulates those around her, uses movies to babysit her class while she sleeps off a hangover every morning and is totally devoid of any sense of professional responsibility to her students, then maybe you'll find this film funny.

The overriding conceit at the heart of `Bad Teacher' is the idea that the audience will somehow look past the reprehensible moral bankruptcy at the core of the central character (played to perfection by Cameron Diaz) and root for her, because she's good looking and has a few memorable one-liners so all can be forgiven. The character Diaz plays so well is dishonest, greedy, lazy, irresponsible, rude, utterly self-serving and in every way despicable. She is educating your kids, folks, and her manipulative, blackmailing ways win out for her in the end. This is funny, OK?

The film gets two stars rather than one because, on a purely technical level, it works as a (very improbable) narrative. The storyline is coherent and the editing snappy, the actors give their all, the script does have its moments, it's watchable. But somehow it's hard to get past the overall message the film leaves you with: if you're a selfish, lying, morally bankrupt, pot-smoking, drunken, money-grubbing whore willing to blackmail and deceive all around you whilst having complete contempt for any kind of professional responsibility to your students and their futures, this is in some way admirable. You will win out over more honest and responsible people, and it's hilarious.

"James Cameron has possibly given movies a new life where 2D movies just do not compare to a 3D visual sensory extravaganza. Going to a theater once again feels worthwhile. This movie is possibly the closest you could get to experiencing what life could possibly be on another planet. I was constantly amazed at the little details like a shrinking plant, a lizard with a parachute thing, bio-connection with other lifeforms and so many other little things within the movie.

The story was not too unique and from a sci-fi perspective, there are better stories out there (Enders Game for example). But what this movie has done is to create a benchmark for a new genre of 3D computer generated movies. The benchmark being both in detail and production quality.

This is possibly the first time I have seen a movie where despite a lukewarm story, I still was 100% focused on the movie and left the theater with the feeling of having experienced a new civilization. It took me some time to digest all that I saw within this movie and I may do another trek to the theater to look at the finer details in the forests once more.

There is a strong eco-friendly and anti-war message throughout the movie with the good and bad guys clearly defined. This one is a monumental work and definitely worth watching.",5.0,0

I it simple, elegant, and does exactly what I want.

"One of those increasingly rare ""wow, this is way better than I thought it'd be"" purchases. Barn doors are trendy and seem like a thrifty way to salvage a used door but then you go to buy the hardware and you're hit with a $300+ price tag. So, a $75 option seemed a little suspicious. But I trusted the reviews, and went for it and I'm thrilled with it.

The good:

 - The hardware is hefty and feels 'well machined'
 - it looks good. Not overly stylized so would fit in well in most rooms.
 - installed fairly easily.
 - Came with a matching door 'handle' (which while noted, was something I didn't realize initially)

The minor nit-picks

 - The roller hardware that mounts to the door isn't adjustable in or out. As such, the rollers will hang over the edge of the door a bit so the door isn't balanced on its center of gravity. Maybe this is intentional, but felt a bit off to me.
 - The instructions could have a bit more detail to them.
 - if you are installing this for a bath, note that you will have a gap between the door and frame (see below).

But, again, for $75, those are certainly nit-picks.

As for the bathroom issue, I don't think barn doors are really designed for bathrooms. In my case, I took off the top casing around the door frame and replace it with one that was twice as long. I then mounted the rail hardware to the casing (through into the wall studs, of course). After mounting the rollers and hanging, you are left with about a 5/8th of an inch gap between the door face and the casing. This can feel a bit awkward in a bathroom. I think the fix will be for me to just get clever with the door trim and fir the gap out a bit with some corner bead or the like.",5.0,0

"Got the Jebsens LED light in earlier and decided to try it out. I got 4 AA batteries, which install in two compartments in the back, and installed them. I have taken some pictures of the light. One in a pitch black bathroom and the other on our bar with a watch for size comparison. The light has two brackets on the back for hanging it. Screws are included with the light. One thing I really liked about the light is that the lens is frosted. That way, I don't get blinded by the super bright LED's. It puts off tons of light. I was really surprised. There is a three position switch on the side. Off, On, and Auto. When switched in the auto position, it is motion sensitive. I tested this in both low light and no light situations. The light will come on when it detects any motion. I walked in front of the light, then out of it's field of view. The light went off in about 5 seconds. As soon as I walked back to the light, it came on again. It will stay on as long as there is motion in front of it. This will work great in our pantry or under the sink, where there is no lights.  This is a really nice light and is going to make finding that lost can of furniture polish  a lot easier.  I received this product at a discount for my unbiased testing and review.

"""Old Joy"" is a movie about a dog named Lucy. Lucy has an owner named Mark who is about to become a father. With his wife about to give birth, Mark takes off for an overnight road trip. Lucy likes this because she gets to ride along. Mark goes and gets his old friend Kurt. Kurt likes to smoke hoochie-choochie weed, but this is okay with Lucy because Kurt will pet her head enthusiastically and throw a stick for her. Lucy runs in the forest and finds a nice big stick. Kurt is taking Mark to a natural spring. Kurt gets lost. The men sit on an abandoned sofa next to a fire and play with an air gun while Lucy looks over at them. Lucy is played by Lucy the dog. She has wonderful dog expressions and a very perky tail that wags wildly with enthusiasm. Her owner Mark is played by Daniel London who was in ""Rent,"" ""The Minority Report"" & ""Patch Adams. ""  London turns in a good subtle performance as he says the right things to his friend, while constantly talking with his wife on the phone and being critical of Kurt. It's obvious that Mark has moved beyond this old buddy relationship. Kurt the buddy is played by Will Oldham who was in ""Junebug. ""  When they get to the sauna, the guys take off their clothes and Kurt tries to give Mark a massage. Mark is not comfortable with this. There are a lot of trees in the film.

"$50 at the big box hardware store, or less than half that for what is functionally identical?  Seems like a no-brainer, but I was concerned about the quality.

I built in a huge custom dresser in my wife's closet and needed sturdy hardware.  The drawers are 45 inches wide, 23 inches long, and 11 inches deep made of 1/2 and 3/4 inch wood.  A nearly 4 foot by 2 foot by 1 foot drawer is ridiculously heavy and requires two pulls per drawer.  I was worried these less expensive pulls wouldn't be up to the task of hauling such an enormous drawer out of the wall, but my fears were unfounded.

They feel identical to the $5-each pulls at the hardware store, and even came with two different length screws to install them!  Bear in mind that there is no template for drilling holes, but frankly I would have thrown that out anyway.  The holes are 3 inches apart on-center, so just get your level and a tape measure and you're in business.  The screws have so far been able to hold the pulls in nice and tightly, and the metal seems reasonably hard.

If any issues develop, I'll update this review, but I highly recommend these pulls!",5.0,0

"Two of Jack Nicholson's best ever tantrum scenes
If you've seen this movie, you probably know what I'm talking about. There's one scene in which Nicholson REALLY doesn't want to invite his ditsy girlfriend (Karen Black) to come along to the family home to visit his dying father - and when he realizes he can't get out of it, he sits in his car and comes unglued. Then he get out, goes back inside and very calmly says, ""Rayette, you wanna come with me?""
The other one is in a roadside caf when the laconic waitress won't alter the menu selections by one jot - and again he comes unglued as only Nicholson can do when he's at the top of his performance, which he usually is.
But the rest of this movie is dark, dark, dark - a mood piece of a dysfunctional family. Nicholson plays a wounded outcast, a former piano prodigy who has been estranged from his father for years, spending his time as an oil worker in Texas, shacking up with his annoying girlfriend. When he learns his father is dying in Washington State, he sets off for 'home.' Most of the rest of the film is an odyssey, a road trip back to the family mansion and all he's left behind: his attachments, his family, his problems, his fears, and his failures.

"Normally I feed my cats Fromm Four Star dry foods but I was looking for something a little more budget friendly available with Prime shipping that was still a better brand. With four cats it gets expensive! After doing some research I found Earthborn which fit the bill. Normally 3 out of 4 of my cats are not picky so I wasn't worried about them liking it. However my cats had different plans - they ALL refuse to eat it. It's been a game of chicken over the last couple of weeks with me refusing to buy any other brand and my cats loudly voicing their displeasure with this food. I finally gave in and bought another brand because I was sure they were plotting my death! I don't know whether it tastes horrible or bland, or if it's the tiny kibble that turns them off. Since they hate it, the only compliment I can give it is the bag I received had a slider to close the packaging to keep the kibble fresh. I wish more brands did this.",2.0,0

"I bought these despite a previous reviewer concerned with the ""cheap plastic"" not being able to ""dissipate heat"".  The  reason you SHOULD by these lights is because there's no heat to dissipate! That's the beauty of LED's: instead of making light and heat like the halogen lights we're replacing, LED's just make light, hence the energy savings. BTW., if the reviewer is that worried about heat dissipation, he should hurry up and get these because the old halogen lights in recessed ceiling cans get way to hot for my comfort level. Even the heat protection devises to make them safe for installation in attic spaces don't do that good of a job.

Not sure why he had such failure. I'm not sure if LED's can be used outside, in wet exposures. Curious to know how the guy who said they fit in the Malibu (exterior) lights from the boxed store are holding up! I hope well...these would save me a ton of money if I can replace those as well!!",5.0,0

"Ok, this is one of those bias reviews that people write about.  For example, a huge Aerosmith fan may write about how great they were and are, going on how Aerosmith is the greatest band in history, blah blah blah.  But when one is talking of professional wrestling, the first name that pops in peoples minds is Hulk Hogan.  With that, he is the greatest, biggest, and most popular name in the history of sports entertainment.  I could care less about his technical wrestling skills, because we all know that pro wrestling is fake and how good of a technical wrestler someone is has no effect on the outcome of the match.  So, charisma, charisma, charisma is where it's at and no one had more or better charisma than Hulk Hogan.  I have watched this on more than one occasion.  It is money well spent.  I would have easily paid 100 bucks for this, but thankfully it was no where near that expensive.

The only downside of this DVD is the lack of biographical material.  But it makes up for that with tons of matches.  The overall match selection was really good.  It covers matches from way back during his first run in the WWE in the late 70's to his championship run in the 80's and early 90's to the WCW/NWO days all the way up until his last match with Randy Orton last year.  The DVD was only missing one or two matches that I personally liked a lot.  Those were the matches with Earthquake from Summerslam 90 and the match against Sid Justice from Wrestlemania VIII.  These two matches really showed the ovation Hogan commonly recieved, but amplified many times due to the circumstances.

My personal favorite was the match with The Iron Sheik from January 1984, where it really all began.",5.0,0

"I reviewed this movie after seeing it in theaters and gave it 3 1/2 stars. It has grown on me after seeing it a second time. I think it is on par with the first film, but the FF movie series suffers from too much comedy! I like comic book films to be fun but, it took away the drama in this movie and our heroes seemed to be in no danger. When the Thing gets hurled into Mr. Fantastic and they are imbedded in a wall the Thing's states ""That Smarts""! and peels Reed off the wall like a cartoon!

Although funny, too much of this just made it seem like a parody. The Thing's rocky exterior looks much better this time around and so are the effects. The Silver Surfer is a welcomed addition to the franchise and his FX are done extremely well! I know a lot of people were disappointed in Galactus being presented as a cloud but, I think an armor clad giant with a purple helmet would look ridiculous floating though space eating planets. The film is a bit short, but over all it's fun and captures the essence of the comic book.

This film is not perfect, but it is entertaining for fans of the series. I hope there will be a third entry in the series. I would like to address some problem with the Thing. I can see cross over's galore in the future and the Thing as he has been presented in these films wouldn't last one second with the Hulk if they ever do battle in a live action film! Anyway there will be lots more Marvel in the future.....I can't wait! The DVD transfer looks fantastic and there are plenty of extras to keep you busy.",4.0,0

"If you are interested in getting a feeling for the awful events that plagued Rwanda during the genocide acts recently - this is a great presentation of the events, based on my knowledge. It is kind of documentary and drama blended together.

What is striking, given the date of this review, is just how ludicrous the world can be. It is shameful! People knew the events were taking place but with no oil or resources for nations to maul there was no interest to lend a hand. There are no acts of humanitarianism by super powers, just self fulfilling acts that benefit leaders of nations - self interest. Take the wikileaks for example that are surfacing today. The ""problem"" is the leaks? How can that be? The leaks are documents of criminal acts by leaders of governments - so why is the site questioned and not the leaders?

If you want to get a sense of international mismanagement - I feel we have the responsibility to do so, please watch this video. Other sources on the topic would include Darfur now, and The History and Sociology of Genocide (see below).

This video is a great entertaining presentation of an event we should not have to document.

The device itself works fine.  I think it may have been better for my particular picky cat if the waste was stored at the back, not by the entrance, but beyond that it rakes and stores and is super easy to change.

Where I'm less satisfied is the litter itself.  I've gone through a lot of it transitioning my cat over from his old stuff (on my 4th refill) but I can't imagine it lasting an entire month.  Beyond that, it gets everywhere.  It's a little sharp/uncomfortable when you step on it; and I'm starting to wonder if I just traded one type of work (cleaning the box) for another (cleaning all around the box...and into the other rooms it gets tracked).  I tried using the hood to contain it a little better but had to stop because my cat refused to go in that way- I'm not sure whether it was the smell, since the waste is stored by the entrance; or if it's also a little uncomfortable on his delicate paws.  But he's picky, even for a cat, so maybe that's a unique issue.

"I've used a few timers and have never had a problem with them.

The only downside is that the timer seems to be a bit too small for my liking. The light is so bright it can be heard in the dark. The size is not very useful for such a small light.

The only real negative is that the timer is too small to fit in my pocket. I just put it in my pocket and it is on my belt. It's very easy to move it around in my pocket. The light is too small for my liking.

All in all a great product and a great price.I was skeptical at first but after a few months I was very impressed with this little light.  It looks amazing and I can tell you I am very impressed with the quality and the light quality.  I have no complaints about this light.

I have a few other reviews that have stated that I have a tight spot on the back of the light and the small size makes it difficult to see in the dark.  I have seen this light used in a commercial kitchen remodel.  I will be putting this in a couple of kitchen fixtures for the kitchen that I have in my living room.

If you like horror, this is how it should be done.",4.0,0
"I really can't suggest anything that would make this film better.  The acting is top notch, not just from DeNiro and Grodin, but from the entire cast.  Each character is well defined and believable. I especially liked Dennis Farina's parody of the tough-talking Mafia boss (""Shut up or I'll shove this pencil through your heart!""), and his two flunkies (Moron #1 and Moron #2). The dialogue is great, and the film is laced with humor--the best kind of humor, situational.  There is even a tender awkward moment (when Jack, DeNiro, visits his daughter whom he hasn't seen in years, and she offers to give him her babysitting money, which he feels he shouldn't take, although he needs it).  The action is non-stop, and if you have to suspend your disbelief at times, it is a small price to pay.

The evolution of the relationship between DeNiro and Grodin's characters, as has been mentioned, is the core of this picture. It is done magnificently and is the reason the film is so great. There are so many great scenes: when DeNiro and Grodin are eating dinner on the train, when they pretend to be from the Treasury Department in order to relieve a bartender of his ""counterfeit"" 20 dollar bills, the scene in the diner when Grodin, really hungry and broke, asks what's the special today, and the waitress says chorizo and eggs (dig the look on Grodin's face). DeNiro says they can't afford it, and Grodin counters ""How about your cigarettes?"", and DeNiro says, ""I need these.""  The film is chock full of these delicious scenes--I really can't think of a dull one.

This film is forever.  Buy it and see for yourself.",5.0,0

But now it's dull now matter what type of plot they try.
This one is about a pot grower and a school teacher.
Maybe this might of been interesting if they had used real twins
as the actors.
Instead Edward Norton does a poor job of switching accents and
pretending to look at himself as a twin.
This very old visual trick never works.
You can tell when people do not make real eye contact with
each other.

two different actors who look kind of alike.

"I purchased this light when it was on sale for $29.00 and I wish I had ordered more because I love it and all my friends love it. When it goes on sale again I will order at least six of them. It is so easy to install and use right out of the box. I have a ""Florida"" room that everyone uses as an entrance because it is the door closest to the driveway.  When someone came into that room at night and I always leave that door open, I would never know it and they might fall before they got to the doorbell. When I came in that way at night  I would need a flashlight. Now I know everyone is safe when they come in the door because the light comes on right away. Deliveries from UPS etc. are made in good lighting now. I just don't have anything negative to say about it. I have had it a few months Without a problem. My husband just told me he loves it too. We don't live in the city so we don't get a lot of extra light from neighbours. It gets pretty dark out here where we live. Animals don't set it off because it is set to come on only when you step inside the door.
Update!
 I had the same problem with the battery dying, I found the solution,thankfully:
Ok so I figured it out. When there is a LOT of activity like I had with a cookout you should probably turn it off until after the party but if the battery goes down and it stops working just turn it off and let it charge up again for three days like you did when it was new.  I will buy more now that I know the battery doesn't  need replacing just because it went weak from excessive use. I really do LOVE it for my ""Florida"" room and will get more for my other doors.",4.0,0

He has every right to be angry,he has lung cancer and hates what is happening to his neighbourhood. a gang of thugs so vicious even the police are afraid of them  have taken over and rape,steal kill and destroy whenever they feel like it. The only who cares beside Walt is a pudgy, young priest who has no idea what he is doing.
So Walt starts taken care of things on his own,he also helps a wimpy kid get it together so he can make it in the world.

I read directions in manual just because wise thing to do. I opened the fly nut 6 or 7 times and ran it until air was out of hydraulic line. After retightened I decided to check oil on the stick after reading reviews about oil being at lowest line from factory. I tilted it up on end and put 7mm hex in nut and will not move. I mean will not turn loose. So I called 800 number. Got a very pleasant gentlemen on phone that told me that's because they use thread lock so it will not leak in transit. He said you have to give the hex wrench a hard tap to break the glue or use a lock creasant  wrench (vise-grips) to lock on the round end of hex dip stick and give that a tap to loosen. This is not in the manual. Word of advise: Do not strip your 7mm hex nut, use the lock wrench and tap it and behold it is loose. Then screw it out with hex wrench that is included. I found the hydrologic oil to still be between the lines. Then I spent about 3 hours splitting about half a cord of wood. it went through my hard sweet gum ball wood like butter( if you get it with the grain). Stacked it and covered it and done. Also use some kind of silicone spray on the black and red back and forth stuff. Oil will cause wood chips to stick to it. And it helps to prevent screeching sounds. Great price, great design, great one handed control. I'll never wear this thing out. I bought from amazon there 50 foot 12 guage 15 amp cord and it works great with no issues. great price also

"I was contacted by this vendor to provide a review in exchange for a discounted price.  That said,  I'm glad I purchased this toy.  My male cat especially goes crazy over it.  My female cat hasn't bothered with it as much but hasn't been feeling well in general.

Height/Size is good and rope is wound and secured tight to post.  Base is solid and stands tall when cats scratch.  As my pictures show, my male cat has long legs and body and this post height fits him fine. Assembly is easy, only requiring a philips screwdriver.  My young niece and nephew had fun assembling it for the cats who started using it immediately.  The feather is a nice tease and so far still in tact after a few days of use. My cats seem to like the course texture.  From the pictures you'll see the cat playing with it in different rooms as we moved around looking for the right spot. Placing it where he stalks helps keeps him from scratching the carpets and furniture. My cats do well when we stimulate them with toys preventing boredom. The quarter circle shape fits nicely in corners or along walls.  We already had a post  with a square base and spring with pom-pom, which I don't like as much as this post.  I've never seen my cat go for the Pom-pom but the feather gets them going!  Having more in the house is not a problem, one upstairs, one downstairs.

"Putting one of my all-time favorite books, Robert Kurson's ""Shadow Divers,"" into documentary form could not have been better served than having the two men who actually lived it, John Chatterton & Richie Koehler, reenacting their roles!  John Chatterton is a total man with his perfect code of ethics, his raw courage & experience, his class 'A' intelligence and heroic handsome features.  Richie Koehler originally hung with a band of bad boys and had a major problem at home, as well.  However, Chatterton knew and valued his abilities, raw courage and superb  knowledge, so he went to work to get him on the right side of history with himself.  John & Richie have created one of the richest stories of modern times; and, by doing it have solved one of the last persistent mysteries of WWII.  (Add to this the amazingly nail-biting writing style of Robert Kurson from the original book, and you have a story for the ages.)  It further contains the sorrowful father & son tragedy which also happened for real.  This documentary presents the best of human exploration with the very compelling and heartfelt knot in throat conclusion.  I recommend this DVD to all who have read the book, and all who enjoy the heartbeat and heartstop of stories of buried treasure.  This is the ultimate, as it happens underwater with zero room for error!",5.0,0
"As some of the other reviewers has stated, this is definitely a version 1.0 product.  I'm on an Android phone and the app is missing the ability to view the camera remotely. You can't simply use the Skybell app to see if everything is OK at the door.  The motion detection doesn't work, and you have to press the door bell before it'll send you an alert.  This was supposed to be working when they shipped.  I emailed them directly to check before ordering.

The Android app is crashing when you try to configure some things.  Android tablets are not all supported so you can't use all your mobile devices inside your home to view the Skybell activity. I have an Acer and the app will not install on the device. This is limiting as you always have to have your phone near you.  Hope they fix this soon.

I had my WiFi access point configured for N-Only as I do not have older 802.11b/g devices.  It never connected to the 2.4Ghz N-Only radio.  I had to go back into the WiFi AP and reconfigure to support the older 802.11b/g devices.  It says it's N compatible, but looks like it may not be.  This delayed the install procedure as I tried 5 times to get the device connected to the WiFi before taking a look at the WiFi AP settings.  So if you're having problems connecting it to your WiFi, double check this setting.

I think the concept is a really great idea and hopefully these items are simply version 1.0 growing pains.  Wait a few months for the product to mature.  If they can get the rest of the features in and fix the app bugs, it'll be a cool product.",3.0,0

I am supposed to admire his kill, revive it (I guess) and throw it down the steps like a Slinky (boing-boing-boing-boing!) (well, they don't ""boing"" but they bounce!). If I sleep through ""Pink Ball"", it is placed on the rug while he hunts for ""Blue Ball"". ""Blue Ball"" is usually dead and on the rug by about 4:12 AM (just enough time to fall back asleep if I fake slept through ""Pink Ball"". ). Well, if dumb Mommy sleeps through ""Blue Ball"" presentation then it is placed ~6 inches to the right of ""Pink Ball"" and off we go for ""Yellow Ball"". Repeat.

"McQuarrie is clearly a movie junkie.  This is evident by his Peckinpah-esque story arc and settings and his pair of anti-heroes; the John Woo-esque excessive gunplay, the subsequent and frequent showers of bullets, and the limitless supply of people to kill, and guns to kill them with; and the Quentin Tarantino-esque self-conscious subversion of the genre.  I didn't mind all his overt nods/homages/rip-offs (whatever) because it still made for a heady mix that was fun, albeit a little too violent for my tastes.  Even the slow, slow-speed car chase, the failed-but-then-successful kidnapping attempt, and the cell-phone bit were fun although it's clear that McQuarrie is too conscious of the trademarks/cliches set down by his predecessors and is trying his darnedest to put a fresh spin on things.  But what weren't fun for me were the complex turns the plot took about halfway through the film.  Last week, I saw another overplotted film, ""Nurse Betty"", and I forgave the turns in that plot because LaBute dutifully made sure each of them paid off (although not all of them worked).  Here, the complications get piled on top of one another for no reason, and some are left to dangle without ever being resolved or even referred to again.  In McQuarrie's defence, I did get the feeling that many of the needless plot devices were meant to set up that final line of dialogue.

Then, it would slowly (and randomly) retract again for no apparent reason.  I kept using it hoping that the stiffness in the locking mechanism was responsible and it would loosen up.  No such luck.  It just continued to get worse.  The final straw was when one of my dogs got the retracted lead wrapped around her back legs and fell hard on the sidewalk.

"Entering the theater today I saw a movie with the same name.  This is a movie that is a little too old for the age of the video, but it is a very entertaining movie.  I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to watch an old-fashioned adventure movie.  It is a must see for any movie lover.I didn't think this was going to be a great movie.  I was expecting more.  I expected a good, thoughtful story that could have been told about a very interesting subject.  I'm not sure why I was so disappointed.  The acting was okay, but the story was not convincing.  The movie had a lot of clichs and was a bit too ""raw"".  I don't think I've ever seen a movie with a good story, but this movie didn't seem to be that bad.  I don't really know what the problem was with the movie.  I was hoping to see more of the ""real"" version of the movie.  I guess it was supposed to be a story about a real person.  It seemed like it was going to be about a couple of men who get into a gang of robbers in a beautiful city.  It was a bit cheesy at times but it was a good story that could have been told about a guy who is a pretty good actor.",4.0,1

The Fugitive had pixel problems in all players and the same happened to the unforgiven. the only movie that was OK was The Last Samurai.

The story is supposed to be about Voldemort (and the mystery of the half-blood prince), getting harry prepared to face things, in one of these ways letting him get to know his enemy and his origins through memories (the relationships between characters is important  just not as important to the story as EVERYTHING they left out!, and other relationships Harry forms are important too but these characters such as dobby never really appear in the movies after they are introduced in one of them...)The director that did this movie is a MORON, and they should be forced to film all the missing story gaps and a few more memories and re-release the movie and if not that at least film all of the stuff and extend the movie on blu-ray by at LEAST 30 minutes!  The movie makes no sense, even my wife who had not read the books said it feels incomplete and half-made...  I hate that they cut out the battle at the end of the book too, oh yea we'll just strut out  of the castle...

Hint:  Use the funnel and no drops go on the counter top.  Instructions are on the back of the box.

Installation was quick and easy.

"I am a big Beatles fan but always had mixed feelings about John. He was obviously a great musician and showman. His Imagine album is wonderful, and his plea for peace in the title song is downright anthemic for the peace movement. He truly believed in love; his favorite lyric was ""All you need is love."" At the same time, for much of his life he was often nastily sarcastic, hotheaded, and abusive, especially when drinking. My understanding of his boyhood before I saw this film was that Lennon liked to exaggerate how difficult his situation had been, separated from his mother and raised by his Aunt Mimi, when in reality he had a very comfortable, secure, middle-class upbringing. I continued to hold this view throughout the film, thinking how good he had it: a reunion with a mother who was fun, doting, and indulgent while being watched over by a strict, but loving, aunt. That is, until the moment when Mimi revealed to him exactly the circumstances of the loss of his father and separation from his mother. Then I got it. And when he finally lost his mother for good, I can see why he described his growing up years as hard. I have much more sympathy for him now.",5.0,0

"Our little mini-beagle boy is a hyper chewing monster!  Every toy we get him gets destroyed in a matter of days.  (The ones with ""chew guard technology"" last after he's ripped a hole, pulled out the squeaker & stuffing, etc, if anyone's interested LOL)  This ball was his new favorite as soon as he saw me take it out of the box.  It's still his favorite, and he'll go NUTS playing with it all by himself as well as when we throw it for him to fetch.  I got the big one, so he rarely can bite it enough to hear the squeaker, but that's ok.  As for chewing, all he's managed to do is chew off the eyes, but hasn't been able to rip a hole in the ball.  I think the ""fur"" is so long & fuzzy, it tickles his nose LOL.  All in all, this ball is the BEST TOY we've purchased for our little guy (11 mo old).  will definitely buy a replacement when the time comes.  for now, this thing is still in great condition and ready for its first washing.  we've had it for a little over a month.

"It is now my go to litter for my cats.  I am traditioning away from the regular Tidy Cat clumping litter in the 35 lb buckets. Among the litter boxes I currently have are two identical litter boxes side by side, one with regular clumping litter and the other with the lightweight litter.  And my experience is that the Tidy Cat clumping litter has more dust then the Tidy Cat lightweight litter, and tracks less.  My cats don't show a preference from one over the other, but lugging around 35 lb buckets is making me make a preference.  This lightweight litter actually seems to clump harder.  And when you have to scoop through 3-4"" of litter to remove the clumps, the lightweight litter makes a big difference.  In the past, I have kept 200-300 pounds of litter on hand, now I can have half that weight on hand, which is easier on me.  And yes, litter tracks.  I don't care what type you get, they will manage to track it.  I don't smell urine odor, but feces odor depends on whether the cat decides to bury it or not, or how well.",4.0,0

Then, gave him some Benadryl to help make him more comfortable! Finally after 45 minutes he was able to sit still and sleep since the Benadryl made him a little drowsy..

"I love this DVD! Rodney Yee DVD's from Gaiam have become some of my favorite practices. You really need to know a bit about yoga (like the warrior series) before you do this practice. There are no detailed instructions, so I think it would be disappointing for a beginner.

I loved the flow of this practice. Yes, the sun salutations are a bit fast, but is okay since this warms you up for the floor stretches to follow. He holds you in downward facing dog to rest, but I think the pace is perfect to warm you up quickly. It is a short workout of only 30 min., but perfect for those days when I don't have a lot of time. You will definitely get the flexibility on the floor postures after the warm up.

I use Rodney's ""Power Yoga Total Body"" which I love too, but it is 1 hour. This practice is very similar, but 1/2 the time. You really can't go wrong on this one for $7 on Amazon.

One of them is disdainful towards any kind of scratching post -- but the other has ripped through several of the inexpensive $9 throw-away boxes. In fact there are at least two or three of them spread through the house, not counting the little crunchies left behind from enthusiastic scratching.

When I bought the PetFusion Cat Scratcher Lounge I worried a little bit whether spending this kind of money would be evidence that I've turned into a Cat Lady. Well, maybe I have... but at least I know I did not waste a cent. Because from the first moment that Shaka met this ""lounge"" (as you see in the video) she has claimed it as her own. It's a good thing that the other cat thinks it's ""meh,"" because Shaka would defend this with a temper tantrum.

Yes, it's on the large side. It's probably as big as some people's side coffee tables. That's fine for us because it has becomes the cat's regular perch, and (for a small cat) she stretches out very comfortably. And then she indulges in some dainty ripping-apart-of-cardboard as she scratches to her little heart's delight.

Fortunately as other reviewers have reported, it's constructed very well, with the cardboard FAR more dense than in the cheap scratching boxes you're thinking of. I won't need to replace this for a good long time.",5.0,0

"The construction of this Mag-Lite Solitaire is really quite good.  It's very sturdy and I've had one run over by my truck and had a 150 pound (68kg) Television drop on another without much visible damage (scratches).

The problem is that it runs through batteries pretty quickly if you use this for anything more than looking for your keys on the ground or the deadbolt on your door when you forgot to leave on the porch light.  The lens cap tends to turn itself on in your pocket or bag... draining away the power.  I haven't ever used it as a keychain device as I don't like a lot of bulk.

I haven't ever experienced the reported problem with the end cap loosening.  The best task I've found for this light is to hang it on the keyring holder in my laptop bag.  It's simply not well suited to a pocket or to a keychain, and I believe that was its intended purpose.

I found the light, itself, to be fairly bright at full power, but with a more robust LED, it would probably be a better unit.  It does have a better light distance than an LED would produce, though.  All-in-all, a bit of a miss, but I'm a flashlight hound, so I still like it.  If you are looking for a good keyring light, get a smaller LED with an on/off switch.  This would probably make a good light for a purse or in a glove compartment.  I would recommend pairing it with a Lithium Battery (Technuity L92BP4 Battery, Lithium Aaa Photo Battery for example) - especially if storing in car or bag for long periods.  Make sure you tighten the lenscap well so it doesn't accidentally turn on.",3.0,0

"Really great movie. Burton is at his best and the rest of the actors are as well. A well-measured approach to a perceived real world look at what being a spy must be like- true to form. Not much James Bond like action here but that isn't what this movie is all about. This is a character study that almost feels like a stage play: every scene is set and paced to take the viewer deeper and deeper into this hidden and bleak world.

  Viewing this film over Amazon prime was a treat. Although in B&W, it was very sharp and very close to true Blu-ray image quality. Of course with any movie enhanced by the Blu-ray process there is always something one never noticed before that catches the eye. In this case I couldn't help but be distracted by the small growth under Burtons right eye. It was distracting because I've never seen it before in his other films. But I guess every diamond has its flaw and IMO that was this the only thing I found about this film that I didn't like.",5.0,0

"We've had to switch brands multiple times when buying bully sticks.  The last one we loved but they are out of stock and no ETA on when more will be in.

These seem to be larger on average than others we have purchased, like someone picked the best ones ahead of time.  That was nice since even at the pet store, you might not have enough to pick that many choice ones.

But more importantly, they are the darker color my dog seems to prefer.  Some brands started out this way but then started selling packages were the sticks were more golden in color, and my dog didn't like those much.  I don't know if it's a change in how they process them, or what animal it comes from, but the dark ones seem to be the best.

I have a male Samoyed and when he's in the mood he'll reduce one of these by half or less in pretty short order, maybe 30 minutes or so, then finishes the entire thing later.  When they are good he'll even eat up any small pieces.  He's a big dog at almost 70 pounds though, and only water buffalo horns and bones last any length of time.

I've seen many reviews on many bully sticks wanting 'odorless' sticks.  I've not noticed them to be overly stinky but, it is a dried piece of animal, it does smell a little bit.  I don't even notice it unless I'm sitting by my dog, though.",5.0,0

It did cut my dog (poodle) very well. I guess I can not say great because I had a Laube clipper and it was amazing. However at this time I could not afford it. I also ordered another clipper that cost a lot more money then this one and I returned it because it was to big and too bulky.

I kept looking at a lot of reviews and came upon this Wahl. The reviews of this item was amazing for the price. It is lite like my previous clipper. It did cut very well. The combs that come with it does pull somewhat but still works very well. One thing too that no one mentioned before is the blade does pop off so you can clean the blade. Just remember that it is so important to keep the blades cleaned and oiled. That is the life of the clipper. I really did not keep my previous clipper maintained like it should have. If I did I would not have to have bought  another clipper right now.

I am not new to cutting my poodle. I have been doing it for a little over 2 years so I have got pretty good at it and pulling hair out of ears, squeezing anal glands, cutting under the pads,and cleaning teeth. There is just so much more to clipping a dog.... I would buy it again",4.0,0

"I really love these night lights! They are slim, visually appealing, and very bright without being glaring. My old night lights had the sensors mounted on top, which could present problems when used in locations under kitchen cabinets or other areas that were ""shaded"". The senors on these lights are in the center and work no matter how they are plugged in. I like to use mine in the top receptacle, leaving the bottom one free for plugging in other things. This also makes the 3 way switch easily accessible from the top. Yes!!! I did say 3 way switch! You have the options of two brightness settings, and can turn the unit off without unplugging it. This is so very handy for me because I work nights and don't need to leave things lit up while I am at work. If you want access to the top receptacle, and don't need easy access to the switch, you can flip it over and plug it into the bottom. Easy!!! The ""HIGH"" setting really lights up my bathroom for those nocturnal visits. I never liked to turn the lights in in there if I am half-awake and plan on jumping back in bed after the deed is done.

Some people may not like being able to see the separate LEDs glowing in the ring, but I find it to be very decorative. I also like the bluish glow they give out much better than a glaring white or yellow light. Place a few of these in some strategic locations, and you'll have no trouble navigating through your darkened house at night. Fumbling in the dark for the light switch will be a thing of the past. You get two for this great price. Have a basement? Get at least two more! Two of these has replaced four of the old style lights for me. I'll never go back!

I had never seen this movie, so I didn't know what to expect.  I was a little worried that they would find out the truth behind it, but I was a little disappointed.  I don't know why the people who did this didn't get this movie, but I guess I just didn't expect it to be so funny.  I guess it was supposed to be funny, but I guess it was more like ""One More Time"" and that would have made it more interesting.  I guess it was just a little too far fetched, but it was worth watching.  I think it was really good.  I think that people who are not interested in the movie should watch the movie and not buy it.

This lamp is replacing a smaller 3xAAA type headlamp. I wanted something more powerful and this fits the bill.

I prefer some other designs where you can turn it on/off back to the same mode depending on how quickly you pressed the button. One thing i may try is putting in an inline on/off switch on the exterior wiring.

"I have no doubt that this is an amazing showerhead. I was confident in this when I got this showerhead because I have other Grohe fixtures in my home, and they are awesome. So, I have every confidence in the quality of this fixture.

My problem with it is that while it says ""retro-fit,"" which would seem to indicate that it can be retrofitted to just about any shower out there, assuming that the shower has enough room to fit the unit, which mine did. The problem (for me, anyway) is that the fixture is so heavy, it needs to be anchored into the wall with huge screws both on the top of the unit and the bottom. So, you have to have the structure inside the wall of your shower in order to have something to anchor those screws into. I happen to have an older home, and while my shower was re-done recently, (not by me), the structural integrity just isn't there. Luckily, the plumber I hired to put this unit in, realized this before he got too far into it.

So, the bottom line is that, again, while this is a ""retro-fit"" showerhead, it will not work for every shower, and you need to be very careful to know whether or not your shower can work with this unit...not just in terms of size, but in terms of structural integrity inside the walls...before you buy it.

I was unable to install this unit, but I'm still giving this a four star rating. Why? Just based on my previous experience with Grohe products...knowing how great the quality is with this company. I also thoroughly inspected all the parts of this when the plumber opened the package, and all parts for this are heavy, well made, and high-quality. I'm keeping this unit because I plan to re-do my bathroom one day soon, and I am definitely going to use this once I do.",4.0,0
"""The Facts of Life"" is one of those great television shows that defined the 80s. It had comedy but easily tackled issues young people were facing such as drugs, sex, and simply morals and things like self-esteem.

This DVD release does what few first season sets don't; it packs in two seasons, includes some actually good extras that includes interviews with some key cast members, and simply gives the fans of the show what they wanted. The transfer to DVD seems okay or decent. The extras, as mentioned, were good ... they included interviews of some of the women who played the girls in the first season (and made a few appearances in season 2).

I didn't remember the show being as funny and engaging as it was from the start into the second season when the cast was downsized and focused on a select few. The writing wasn't too cheesey and the plots were fresh and still are today. This is one of those shows, and DVD releases, that I'd have to say is a ""must own."" This was a piece of television history when T.V. wasn't loaded down with reality shows and poor shows. Get this show on DVD, you won't be disapointed.",5.0,0
"Until LED's came along I was regularly changing light bulbs in my house, and they aren't cheap. These are more costly but you get the money back in longevity. At this point most of the lights in our home are LEDs, and almost all of them are by FEIT. In the last two years since I started switching over to these I've only had one go bad out of about 30-40  lamps.

They produce less heat than incandescents. This saves you more money when you are cooling your house, less money when you were warming it anyway with a furnace. But either way, less heat generated.

The light is whiter than incandescent.

They dim down to a point then go out suddenly. They may buzz a little when dimmed, depending on the quality of dimmer you use. Some dimmers are not designed for LED or CFL bulbs.

"I've read a number of true crime books, but haven't delved too much into movies.  I was actually steered towards this one - which I'd never heard of - by a review on another movie, so three cheers to Amazon reviewers for helpful recommendations!

The movie intrigued me for a number of reasons - true crime, drama, and John Cusack playing a character other than, well, John Cusack.  Don't get me wrong, I love the heck out of a socially awkward, passionate about music, good looking & articulate guy as much as everyone, but I was interested in seeing him portray a different sort of character.  He does so well, the average guy next door with twisted desires and dark secrets, pushed to the edge of discovery by Nicholas Cage, playing - well, not Nicholas Cage.  You know, the somewhat over the top slightly kooky guy?  Not this time.  It's a nice role reversal on the good guy/bad guy dynamic that they had in Con Air (which I'll need to watch again soon) with both parts played quite convincingly and realistically.

The theme and the setting of the movie is dark, a pallor cast over it from early on that makes you want to see if your monitor or TV has changed settings while you weren't paying attention.  The action mainly comes in the form of suspense, with some difficult scenes and little humor to break the mood, or even worse, mock the truth behind the tale.

Given that this is based on a true story, I felt it was written, scripted, and acted out with respect for what happened, and for the victims and their families.  Demons do live among us, sometimes frighteningly close, with angels as passionate about protecting people as the demons are about hurting them.",5.0,0

"I haven't read the well regarded comic book (er, sorry, graphic novel), but this movie is terribly dull. The idea of taking well known characters from the Victorian Era's popular literature (Allan Quartermain, Captain Nemo, Tom Sawyer, Dr. Jekyll, Dorian Gray, The Invisible Man from the novel by H.G. Wells, Mina Harker from Dracula) and rethink them as superheroes sounds odd but interesting. And if such endeavor would make some young people read the original books, one can certainly sympathize with that. But this film is dull. The action scenes are uninspired. And one wonders if the filmmakers even read the original material: here Dorian Gray has more lives than Terminator, Verne's Captain Nemo looks more like Sandokan, Jekyll is inspired more by the incredible Hulk than by the character of Robert Louis Stevenson's novel, Tom Saywer is a hothead cowboy rather than Mark Twain's country boy, etc. There are fine actors here (Sean Connery, for one) but they look embarrassed here, as well as they should be.

I decided to purchase a newer canister type filter.  The reason for this is my 54 gallon tank had been shut down for 3 months with only the dried up gravel in it.  So I started it back up in October of 2014 with my Magnum 350.  I decided to test my tank for ph and ammonia levels and found out that the ammonia was 1.0 ppm too high.  Of course I immediately dosed the tank with Ammo Lock.  Other then that the tank was doing well with no fish in it as of yet.  Because of the ammonia I went to my local pet store supplier and purchase the Aqua top CF400UV.  Installed it and within 24 hours the tank started to cloud up.  I made several water changes and cleaned the filter several times over a period of 2 weeks to no avail.  I contacted my local supplier and they replaced it thinking it must have been defective.  Well! The tank never cleared even after another 10 days of water changes and filter changes.  So I thought I would reinstall my Magnum 350.  Within 12 hours my tank was nearly clear.  After 24 hours it was crystal clear.  So I guess I have to say that I either got two defective filters or the Aqua top 400 UV just could not handle my water condition.  I have over 30 years experience with fish and tanks and I am baffled by this.  I found the filter easy to use and to be very quiet.  Just as an FYI for others who are new to this non self priming filter.  You should fill the canister first about 1 from the top and install the cover then fill the in and out inlets.  Hook it up and just press the primmer button twice or more and just turn it on and you are good to go.,1.0,0

The faucet is designed for 4"" to 18"" spread between the handle and spout, but I do not recall that being specified in the advertisements. Our large single bowl sink caused the two to be mounted at opposite sides at the rear of the sink--20"" apart center to center. I soon discovered that the spout grounding wire and the LED spout indicator cable would not reach that distance. The grounding wire is a single conductor so it was easy enough to splice and solder some additional wire to span the distance.

To span the extra distance I purchased an extension cable from Radio Shack--designed for use with stereo connections/computer connections etc. The faucet works well, simply and effectively.

"Home Depot added a store brand line of lower-cost LED bulbs and put their Feit bulbs on the clearance rack. I bought a package of 6 bulbs for $7.90,  installed them and was so impressed with the quality and brightness, I went back and bought four more packages to give to friends and relatives.  These are high-quality bulbs.

They FEEL sturdy. I like LED bulbs that have the ceramic ""band"" around the bottom.  They're less fragile and I have cats!  The metal base is solidly connected to the bulb and it screws in to the socket with a tight connection.  They come on instantly with no flickering.  The light streams from the bulbs in all directions so that you get full coverage.

And they're BRIGHT. I was hesitant to buy them because the package is marked ""warm white.""  I prefer ""daylight"" or ""natural light"" bulbs because they give off more light.  I don't want ""ambiance.""  I just want to be able to see where I'm going.  However, these produce a strong, natural looking light with very little yellow in it. They're supposed to be 60W-equivalent, but the brightness is similar to 75W-equivalent LED bulbs.

Because they're so reasonably priced, I felt that I could use them to replace the CFL bulbs in my basement and the difference is incredible. The four ceiling fixtures in my basement have uncovered bulbs, so I appreciate the sturdiness of the Feit bulbs.

I bought these locally and on sale, but the regular price of under $20 for a package of six bulbs is very reasonable, given the quality of the bulbs.  If you want strong light (especially in a place where the bulb may be bumped into) I think these are an excellent choice.",5.0,0

"Summary: I bought the light in October. I had it until November, then it broke. I got a replacement in April after a dozen emails or so. The light was pretty nice though.

The light itself is really nice: small, powerful, nice-looking, exactly what I wanted. The accessories are good too. But don't be fooled by the 5 year warranty, unless you are ok with waiting for several months for a replacement.

The light stopped working shortly after the 30 day return period. No worries, I thought, I have 5 years of warranty from Olight, no problems at all. I contacted them, this is what happened.

10/08/2015: I ordered the light from Amazon.
11/16/2015: The light broke. I contacted them. They told me to unscrew the tail cap, disassemble and reassemble it and try again. That did not work.
11/19/2015: They told me that they'd send me a new tail cap.
11/23/2015: I received the new tail cap. That did not work either.
11/25/2015: They assigned me a RMA number and told me to mail the light in (at my expense). I did that.
12/09/2015: They received the light (according to USPS tracking).
01/19/2015: I contacted them asking what was going on. They told me that they mailed it back to the factory and that I should get it back ""soon"".
02/26/2015: I contacted them again, asking what was going on. They told me that they're sorry and that their usual turnaround time is 1-2 months.
03/29/2015: I contacted them again. They replied immediately and told me that the shipping was lost and that the light was discontinued. They offered me a free S30RII Baton, R20 Javelot or S2 Baton. The S30RII and the R20 are both more expensive than the light I originally purchased, and the S2 is about the same. I chose the S2 nevertheless because the S30RII and R20 are significantly larger than the S20R that I originally bought.
About a week later: I received the light.",2.0,0

"I'm not a purist, I thought where LOTR deviated from the book it was done to good effect and often brought in material and character background from Tolkien's own notes.

The Hobbit movie does not have the same reverence for the source material.  Clearly the makers thought the book story was too boring for modern viewers so they turned it into an action-and-adventure movie with no subtlety or sense of discovery.  Orcs are brought in much earlier in the story to tack on fight scenes and drive the party (rather than boring old cold and hunger).  Computer animated scenes and cutesie additional characters are thrown in to market to kids.  The action in the stone giants scene is right out of Transformers and the orc dungeons are shown as vast Moria-like caverns to allow gratuitous animated tracking shots.

The beginning of the Gollum scene was the end of the movie for me.  Instead of Gollum creeping out of the gloom, he is introduced in a made-up action scene and the ring pops out of his pocket in a flash of animated effects so no one can miss it.

If I was a purist I'd give it one or two stars but if you take it as a standalone action movie and not an adaptation of a great book it's not bad.  So I'm giving it a 3.  Just don't expect the experience you had with LOTR.",3.0,0

"This was my first real viewing (start to finish) of the movie. It's worth a watch if you've never seen it. Not sure if it's one to watch every year, however (as I do  the 1951 ""A Christmas Carol"" with Alastair Sim as Scrooge, or ""It's A Wonderful Life"" with Jimmy Stewart & Donna Reed).

There are some amusing moments - and one sight gag (a la Keystone Cops) that is overused. For me, the intrigue of this movie was less about Ralphie (the main character) and more about the eccentric father and how diametrically opposed the mother was. How in the heck did THESE two hook up?

It did happen - in the middle of Hollywood.

He was freaked out by a noise, was spinning in circles, slipped out and ran away - ran around a huge block, me in futile pursuit (he runs like a greyhound,) crossed 2 busy streets twice (Yucca and Wilcox) and almost went to Hollywood Blvd. Somehow he survived and this story has a true Hollywood ending... apparently a taxi driver had just let out a fare and my little guy jumped in - only way he could've gone in was on his own. Driver waved me up the street, ""He's here!"" Pointed to his yellow mini-van/taxi. I thought he meant he was hiding underneath - no, he was locked in the back seat.

I had 2 large dogs for over a decade, always had them on either a choker or a secure harness, to avoid my greatest fear of them getting loose. Never happened, they both passed away recently within 6 months of each other. Found this little guy in between, almost lost him because of this harness. Yes - it was on snug.

"This is a very good LED lamp for the price. Most people will find the light a bit harsh and the range of color temperatures a bit arbitrary. People who like to fiddle with stuff will enjoy this lamp. Let me list the pros and cons.

Pros:
The lamp is lightweight and seems pretty sturdy and stable on the base.
The light is very steady and there is no flicker.
The controls are easy to learn and access.
The finish is nice.
The lamp head is long enough for most desktop applications.
The lamp head can be pivoted and tilted to a wide range of angles.
The head can be pointed backward to bounce the light off the wall for an indirect lighting effect.

Cons:
The lamp head can only be rotated 45 degrees left and right on the base.
The two middle color temperatures are quite similar and the whitest temperature is very harsh and almost bluish.
The lamp uses a power block instead of a direct plug in.
The styling of the lamp probably won't fit with most desk styles. It is sort of  nouveu but also sort of sharp angled.

I will be using the lamp for some photographic work and it is very good for setting white balance and exposure for close ups. My camera can really tell the difference in the colors, and the range of dimming is very wide. I am not sure whether the lamp has any eye protecting value as stated, or not.

"I'm a Buffy novice. Watching only the movie last year, I had successfully avoided the Buffy phenom year after year. Perhaps it was the undue influence of a certain person that worshipped the shows as the best thing on. But it took my current boyfriend to turn me on to the Slayer and her gang of do-gooders that has made me a complete convert. I stand in the awe of Buffy.
Since I have no other seasons with which to compare this first season, I must say this is a delectable, funny group of episodes. Setting the course of the show, Sarah Michelle Gellar proves her talent early on, giving Buffy the appropriate menace and high school angst. She clearly carries the show on her shoulders, yet carries that mantle with utmost professionalism. Her cohorts are equally compelling. Alyson Hannigan plays Willow, a self-confessed computer geek, with a sense of wonderful innocence. Nicholas Brendon gives Xander, a loveable loser, dignity.  Anthony Head's Giles, know-it-all librarian, is stuffy and fun.
The twelve episodes stand up well, with only a couple of brain scratchers in the mix. The first two set up the series and its characters very well. Some of the favorites included the ""Angel"" episode, that finally helps solve the mystery of the character while seemingly adding more to it, and ""Nightmares"" where seemingly bad dreams enter reality. One particularly odd episode was ""The Pack"", where hyenas seem to enter a group of students as they proceed to reign havoc over Sunnydale, but I didn't buy it.
Overall, you can see the promise of this series in these early episodes. I was pleasantly surprised at the developing sense of humor that seemed to grow with each episode. I really enjoyed the comraderie between all the main characters, as they fight both those hideous Hellmouth demons and the trials and tribulations of puberty. Overall, it's been an enjoyable experience.

There is nothing worse then walking bare-foot into invisible cat litter spread on the floor.

We needed a new cat litter box here so after reading more than I wanted to know about the various options, I picked this one instead of the hooded kind, and I am SO glad I did.

I chose the open design because it is so much easier to just scoop and clean it more often.  There is no odor when you clean it daily and it only takes a minute with this design. A closed litter box is too easy to ignore.

This thing is well-engineered:

Most of the litter stays in the box.
It's effortless to reach down into it to scoop and clean.
Very easy to clean.
Anti-microbial without any chemical odors.
Holds a boatload of litter.
Tucks into a corner.

Since buying it, the litter mess hasn't vanished but it's 90% better. And I am getting attached to the new feline member of the household too.  I recommend this product whole-heartedly!",5.0,0

"It's ironic as I bought this ""cheap"" harness because my puppy managed to chew his way through four very expensive harnesses in two weeks. In frustration I purchased this harness and viola - no more Houdini. There is a grommet on the back of the harness that you can tighten to hold the harness securely in place. No matter what size your dog is, the harness will most likely will fit snugly at all parts of the body (neck, legs, chest) which is exactly what you want. I also like the furry underarm straps so it doesn't rub the fur off his armpits when we're walking. And it's nice that there aren't any ""snapping"" parts to accidentally get his fur or skin caught in. You just slide it over his snout and then put his front arms through the straps. In fact, it's the fastest harness to put on when we have to take him out for a quick tinkle (we don't trust him on just a collar with his strong prey drive). The only downside with this harness is that since our dog is a very strong puller, he still pulls against you when walking. He doesn't choke himself though which is nice. I would recommend that a front clipping harness is better for walking when your dog is a strong puller, but this harness is great if you are tethering him, putting him in a dog seat belt in the car, or taking him out for a quick break (and it's the best fitting harness we've ever found for our growing boy).",5.0,0

"What a wonderful movie this is! The triumph of form over content portrayed with icy precision. Characters acknowledge each other  mostly in terms of self-absorbed one-upsmanship. Surface and ritual reign supreme, indeed characters confuse each other's identities with neither thought nor consequence. Sex, for Patrick Bateman (as probably for all others) is  an expression of vanity and power, nothing more. Patrick Bateman's only moments of true passion and fulfillment occur when he kills. Irony and paradox: does he kill so as to feel alive and vibrant, or does he kill precisely to feed his need to suppress feeling, like an alcoholic drinks to suppress his need for alcohol. Feelings, after all, are messy, not very elegant.  Irony itself conveys a measure of elegance. Thus the movie comments on itself. AmPsy is not really satire. There is no real madness or wackiness here, nor does it carry that element of pratfall, grotesquerie, reality turned inside out to affirm itself, which underly satiric points. It's a disquisition on a decade, a perspective, a way of being that is still very much part of us today. Perhaps now we do it a bit more vulgarly.  There is keen pleasure in realizing that the camera itself, more than words, is the scalpel for the irony which defines this chilly tale. I bet the screenplay is relatively short. Don't miss this film. It's also very funny. You just have to meet Patrick Bateman, a really swell guy.",4.0,0

"These made my dog sick. The other night she was vomiting all night long and had terrible diarrhea. The poor girl was so nauseated that she was dry heaving after completely emptying her stomach. It went on and on for hours. She basically was suffering the same symptoms that humans do when they have a very bad case of food poisoning, complete with chills and shivering, very sore abdominal muscles, weakness and dehydration. It was just awful for her. In the morning, of course, we rushed her to the vet. That was Saturday morning and now it's the wee hours of Monday (I can't sleep) and she's still at the animal hospital having IV fluids, anti-emetics and antibiotics. The vet hopes she can come home later today, but it might not be until tomorrow. The ONLY thing my dogs ate that was new and different in the last several days were these T-Bonz. They each got 2 as a treat. I didn't think the treats had anything to do with it until my other dog had diarrhea and threw-up a bit that morning before we went to the vet. Thankfully he only vomited once and only had a bit of diarrhea and soft stools a couple of times. My pup that got sick had a splenectomy last year, so I'm thinking that whatever was in these treats that made them sick, her body just had a much harder time fighting it off than his. I strongly recommend you NOT give your dog these treats unless you're willing to risk a hefty vet bill, a very sick and completely miserable dog, along with a miserable family, themselves all sick with worry. (Also, just in case it helps anyone or helps add some perspective and clarity: my dog that got very sick is a 20lb schnauzer female, 10 years-old. The dog with a bit stronger stomach is a cocker spaniel-mix male that's 37lbs and he's roughly 10 years-old, give-or-take a couple of years.",1.0,0

"I recently loaned this dvd to a young queer who told me they had no idea that homosexuality was illegal in the United States until 1969. This young person is 22 years old.  Needless to say, the documentation of queer history is sorely lacking. Fortunately the American Experience, which always delivers perfect, entertaining yet respectable productions of historical American time capsules, has approached this subject/story of when gay men and women in America stood up to the police (and the mafia) and said ""No more"".  This production delivers the story of how the current Gay Rights Movement erupted in New York City in 1969.

You get much more than just the Stonewall Inn story.  You get a development of the story of a certain treatment of a certain group of people only rivaled by the horrific trials suffered by the Jews during the holocaust. That may sound dramatic to some, but if you objectively step back and look at the entire history of the treatment of homosexuals in human history, you'll agree that the methodic efforts to obliterate this sector of society has been continuous and is still alive today.

"I installed this switch in a standard garage door opener. I chose this one because I was just starting to get into the garage. The garage doors have a plastic ""turn"" light switch that allows the door to turn in and out of the garage. This switch is a great feature for the garage door opener.

I installed it in the garage door opener by using the light switch. I was able to pull the door open by pulling the door close with a thumb and then push the button to turn it on. The light switch will turn the door on when the door is in a closed position, and when it is open, the door will turn on. The light switch is made of plastic, and the light switch does not come with a case. The light switch has a rubber band that allows it to be removed from the door by removing the plastic band. The light switch is on a low voltage circuit that runs from the battery to the switch. The light switch is a single button on the side of the door, and the switch is made of plastic. The switch is placed in a neutral position so that the light switch will be dimmed when the door is in a closed position. The switch is made of plastic, and the switch is made of plastic.

"I like that this doesn't have corn syrup and petroleum jelly in it. I had been using the regular Laxatone and Lax'aire products, but not for hairballs for softer stools. My kitten, now a year old, has had an ongoing issue with extremely dry stools even though he eats 1/2 wet 1/2 dry diet (wish it were all wet food) and apparently doesn't drink enough water. Anyhow, he loved the taste of the other two as I'd just put some on his food dish and he'd lick it up so there was a concern he wouldn't like the natural version. Thankfully he loves this just as much crying for it as soon as he sees me reach for the tube.

As for effectiveness, neither of the other two seemed to help soften much although I feared giving him too much as I didn't want him to become dependent upon it for bowel movements.  It does make me feel better giving him the natural version. We'll see if it helps soften his stool as thus far even giving him about two half inch servings a day hasn't seemed to help :-( And, I really hope none of the ingredients are bad for kitties...

Update as of July 5, 2014: This product HAS really made a difference and my kitten is no longer in distress or crying when it's time for a bowel movement. It's comforting to know this natural product has made all the difference versus the original product. I give him about 1 inch twice a day. He continues to lick it up as I just put it on his bowl.

"I will say it up front, yes this was a film never previously seen in America, maybe it still has not been. It is from the 1970's, and just about outdoes most other genre entries (no pun intended) in terms of the degree of sleaze radiating off the screen.

Another film where you could speed the film up 4-5 times and quite easily follow the plot, what little there is of it.

I found it interesting to study the eyes of the people 'acting' in this film, there is a lot of uneasiness amid the sleaze on show.

It is really a straight porn shoot (and it is without a doubt X-rated) with one or two lesbian scenes which would have been pretty radical for those days (I'm guessing).

To give an indication of the story and plot standard, the short sex scenes which were often threatening to break out into a very laid back orgy, well those X-rated scenes were the actual highlight of the entire mess on show.

It must have cost a fair bit to make, as it is well shot for the era, and whoever was behind the camera had at least some idea of what they were doing.

I cannot comment on the dialogue as I couldn't bear to expose myself to it (it was dubbed anyway I think, which compounds the agony).

And if you are thinking of purchasing this DVD based on the jacket featuring a gorilla obviously rather taken with a diverting buxom blonde, you will be sadly disappointed.

There is a lame sex scene involving the bloke in the gorilla suit, with a young woman who obviously is unhappy, does not want her face caught on film, and raises the possibility whether she was aware of what was going on or even whether she felt under a little duress during that scene.

Which brings me back to the central point, yes, this is sleaze with a capital 'S'; you sort of do get what was advertised, but it is so tame and takes itself seriously by today's 'standards' it is almost quaint.",1.0,0

"If you replace the pump with a Whisper 10 air pump or something more powerful than the pump that comes with the Whisper 3i filter, then you have a serviceable little, low profile filter. Puts out about 25 gallon per hour then. I coupled it with an Azoo Mignon 60 HOB compact power filter. I had several others where I also switched out the pump. (Use for airstone or sponge filter.).  Because I have a lip on one the tanks, I had to modify the attachment system.  I cut and shaped a length of plastic coated wire hanger into 2 S hooks. I coated the exposed metal ends with aquarium sealer. Then I drilled 2 holes, spaced 2 inches apart in the upper back of the filter housing.  Place the S hooks through the holes and hang of over the lip of your tank.  Be sure and measure for correct desired water level. Final touch. Put a suction cup on the lower stud of the filter back. Be sure to clean the area of the tank wall where the suction cup is to be placed. Stiff, coated auto or household electrical wire will also work for making the attachment hooks. Now the formerly deficient filters work great. They use a minute amount of space and now have more suction and outflow. Be sure to occasionally clean the hole where the airline meets the uptake tube. I enlarged mine. I also had one where a hole had not been drilled through. All the other Tetra Power filters, 10i and above are strong, long lasting, quality filters.",3.0,0

"This doorbell system has a LOT of potential.  What I've found, though, is that it does NOT seem to like cold weather.  I went through two sets of batteries in two months.  I learned and bought a large set of batteries through Amazon to accommodate the cold weather months (I live at 5,000 feet elevation).  Customer service is EXTREMELY prompt and courteous.  After my first doorbell transmitter blew through a set of batteries in under a month, they replaced the unit.  The second unit's battery door doesn't shut all the way and I had to tape it shut.  In 'normal' temperatures, it seems to be fine.  But when the battery starts to go bad, the doorbell will go off on its own randomly, many times in a short span of time.  There is no other way to tell if the battery is dying, other than that or missing guests :(  I'm going to keep using this system, though, knowing what I know about it.  The price is unbeatable, you get what you pay for, and I'm sincerely hopeful that they can improve the design for future models, because the chimes are fine (I use the default 'ding-dong, ding-dong' one) and I'm alerted to guests in a building out behind my home where I cannot otherwise monitor the front door.  NOTE: because this doesn't exactly look like a doorbell to guests, I applied a printed label that I made with my label printer (black text on yellow tape) that says ""DOORBELL"" on it and applied it to the surface of the transmitter to alert people to the bell.  Guests verified that my label alerted them to the existence of a doorbell as they would otherwise not have known I had one because it blends in to the white paint on my house.",2.0,0

"In comedy, TIMING IS EVERYTHING.  Subject knowledge comes in a close second.
George Burns' decades of entertainment experience allowed him to master both both aspects of comedy.  Whether working alone or with a partner (Gracie Allen, Walter Matthau, Bob Hope, Jack Benny, Fred Astaire, Brooke Shields, etc...) George often slipped bits of wisdom in with his punch lines.  Sometimes those were the punch lines.  I could say he was at his best with this collection of TV Specials, but the truth is he was at his best each decade since he partnered with Gracie in 1923.  We can only be thankful George continued working after Gracie's passing in 1964.

"Ok thid is garbage plain and simple.  My brother brought one of these sinks and it does have a hairline crack at the base.  However what struck me as horrid is the thin walls of this sink make it as fragile as a china tea cup. It's pretty enough but its walls are so thin the sink is lucky to last a year without a major failure. If you are John Q Perfect and never drop anything or have any bathroom mishaps this sink is for you.  If you are like most of us and are less than perfect in the bathroom please buy another sink.  While pretty this sink is as thin as the sides of a mug.

I see they are not asking much for this sink which is a releaif because in this case you are getting what you pay for.  This sink looks alot like a quality Porcher sink that I purchased here on Amazon.com.  the construction of my Porcher sink was first rate. The walls were thick fireclay construction.  The porcher sink was made from very hard fire clay and looked alot like this.  Key difference the Porcher sink cost me $600 and will likely last the rest of my life.  I brought two for my bathroom and they still look great.

This sink does look good IF you are lucky enough to get one that does not have tiny hairline cracks.  Often to see the cracks youo must look for them using a very bright light source  The sink is so thin I'm not surprised it has a cracking problem.

"I found the Blair (BLR13224) 3/8 in. Double End Spotweld Cutters to be very aggressive. The first one bit in, snapped one of the four teeth right off. I have no clue what broke it. The second one worked for a minute or so and then did the same. So far the third one is going and cut and removed about two dozen spot welds, but is noticeably becoming worn down. The initial aggressiveness has worn off.

For the money... I have found better spot weld bits and will most likely not reorder these as they definitely don't last as I expected. Sorry, but facts are facts. I'm not that impressed. As I mentioned in the review under ""Blair (BLR13224) 3/8 in. Double End Spotweld Cutter in Blister Pack"", the bits were extremely difficult to remove remove from the #13216 Arbor/Retractable Pilot threaded shaft. I had to resort to putting the arbor into a vice, clamping it down, TIGHT, and removing the bit with a pair of vice grips. The threads are common right handed threads so there should be no doubt one would remove the bit in a left handed motion. Every time I removed a bit, same thing. This is caused by the right handed direction the bit turns when removing spot welds. Understandable, but they really become torqued in place.

Sorry for the negative review, but Facts are Facts! When they cut, they cut. But why make this kind of work more difficult than it needs to be. At the cost??? Well, I'll let you be the judge.",2.0,0

"This could potentially be an outstanding tool, but for a few unfortunate short-cuts and oversights.
Short-cut: detachable legs, designed no doubt to ship in a smaller box and possibly save manufacture expense.  My saw rocks back and forth across two opposite corners because my legs are not straight.  An accurately cast one-piece base would solve this.
Short-cut: cheesy plastic clamps that are awkward to use because the holes in the clamping tensioner through which the clamp rods pass do not align easily, and because in the angle-clamp mode the second part of the tensioner assembly that allows use at an angle does not attach to the main tensioner, but rather aligns loosely, requiring something of a juggling act to assemble the three items for angle-use.
Oversight: the clamp is not usable in its normal configuration (through the back, in the v-slot on the bed) for thinner narrow stock laid flat to miter cut because the clamping foot won't rotate far enough down.
Short-cut: mysteriously, the manufacturer takes the time to give a tutorial on geometry required to lay out angles for frames/boxes that are regular polygons, and even gives tips on saw usage, but provides crappy wordless diagrams for most of the assembly of the tool (which is not totally intuitive and takes a little keen observation to pull off.)

To add drama and conflict the film adds a father-son set-to among the Barretts and a love triangle with the younger Barrett, a female intern at the winery and a Latino employee, who would go on to run his own winery.

Chateau Montelena won with its Chardonnay, but nothing is said (until the film's end) about Stag's Leap's victory in the Cabernet competition.  Similarly, nothing is said about Chateau Montelena's winemaker, Mike Grgich, a then limited partner whose great 1973 Chardonnay enabled him to form a partnership with Austin Hills to form Grgich Hills, which is still known for the quality of its Chardonnay, while Chateau Montelena is now known as well for its superb Cabernet.

Bottom line: this is a slightly schmaltzy take on a historically-significant subject, but one that still works cinematically.  The wine country offers fantastic views, of course, and the Montelena scenes are shot at its stunning facility--a castle carved out of the side of the earth, forming, in effect, a man-made cave in Calistoga.

The DVD includes interviews with the Barretts and a brief account of the winery and its standards and aspirations.  All in all, this is a nice film.  I also recommend the often-overlooked film, Year of the Comet, for wine lovers.",4.0,0

"This is a whole new way of looking at wood building and other projects. I also bought a fancy jig system, then realized this adhesive is the only thing I need. I lined the inside of a cabinet, fastened a dummy door pull to the closet, and added a 3/4 inch piece of wood to the bottom of a door in less than ten minutes. Very fast and very strong!
  As suggested by another reviewer, I remove the tube after squeezing out an inch of adhesive and capping it. I store the tubes in the freezer in a vacuum sealed jar. Oh, and customer service by Franklin international is awesome.

Edit: After a using it for over a year, I am more aware of the limitations at home and in my beginners woodshop. It did not replace the pocket screws or the dowelmax, but complements them. It is unbelievable when I have 2 clean surfaces to be joined with enough flat surface area to hold. These are critical factors to remember.

The short set time for the 30 and 75 glues, though, means I have to get things aligned perfectly and very quickly--which as a novice woodworker is almost never! I just assembled a downdraft sanding box trying the 300 (5 min set time) which worked better for me on this kind of project. A more skilled person would use it for even more things. the biggest advantage is not having to wait overnight for the glue to set before moving on with a project. You are supposed to wait 24 hours before ""stressing"" it but it is strong enough to sand or whatever within 15 minutes.

 I just used a tube of the 75 (partially used) and a new tube of the 300 that had been stored in my freezer and almost 1 1/2 years past the expiration date. Very good product IMO.",5.0,0

The Glenns (two adults and two children) are a middle class, church going family from Tennessee. The Brooks are something of an evolving family. They start out as a young man and his father, and become a young man and his new bride two months into the project. The families are very different in background and personality, making for some very interesting, not to mention entertaining, community interaction."" (from epinions)

"This is a long 2 part story. It appears to be made for Canadian TV. No sex, nudity, or bad language. Like American movies, the bad guys are black, except in this one they speak French Canadian. The main bad guys hang out in Switzerland and boast a mish-mash of indistinguishable international accents, including one female (Belladonna Lithia) whose haircut makes me think she was once part of the Swedish Bikini team of the 1980's.

Ryan Carnes plays Chris Mooore, who lives with people he thinks are his parents. Like Luke Skywalker his past is kept secret and then one day he comes home, finds his legal guardians killed by the bad guys and vows revenge. Like Spiderman, he also likes the redhead next door. And there is a corporate meeting which reminded me of the one in Kill Bill.

Chris Moore has lost his memory and doesn't know he is the Phantom, although he does like to jump around the roofs of buildings. Once he is arrested, his DNA goes out on the Interpol network and he is discovered by the Good Guys and the Bad Guys, the Singh. Eventually Chris assumes the role of the Phantom and uses his new high tech bullet proof suit. It turns out his dad died from cancer (must have been those purple dyed asbestos fibers in the old suit). The bad guys have  a weapon called ""Flicker"" or Flickr for you Yahoos or Flicka for you cowboys. This device uses digital TV to turn people into Manchurian Candidates, who will keep the war machine going and the arms dealers rich.

The movie doesn't have long drawn out action scenes. It is long on dialogue and building characters. If this is the first in a series. i.e. an introduction of characters, they did a good job.

"This is my second Moen pivoting paper holder. The first model I purchased was the Moen Wembley Pivoting style. I love how easy it is to change rolls when all you need to do is pivot one end up and remove the empty roll and replace it with a new one.

This model is different than the Wembley model. On the Wembley model only the thin bar rotates up and you can easily slide the rolls on and off--but I found that the bar rattles a bit . On this model the end of the bar that pivots is attached to about an inch wide segment of  the support bracket.  The roll of paper still fits over the segment--and the extra weight on this pivoting end keeps it from rattling.

"I bought an 8 pack of these and have been replacing the CFL bulbs in the house as they burn out.  I've been much happier with these.  Sure they are more expensive, but I expect them to last ""forever"".  So especially in those pain-in-the-butt-to-change bulb locations (you know the ones I mean) you want to replace with these.  Also the much lower power is great.  I replaced some old incandescents which were actually overheating themselves, and these are so much better.

I have gotten Cree daylight spectrum for outside the house security lights and it looks amazingly clear.  For inside the house, these Soft/Warm lights are much better, I find, but it's up to personal preference.

First thing you need to know that none of the guys are Oscar Nominated actors (Dolph Lundgren, Vinnie Jones, Randy Couture) so every film that they star in is about action. But I must admit that they did a surprisingly good acting job in this one. Also a surprise is the shocking depth of  this storyline. Don't get me wrong the plot is not fantastic by any stretch of the imagination but it is 10 times better than the usual plot which either of these actors stars in. The action sequences are fairly well done but this is not your standard shoot em up film.

"What a weird little flick. This 62 minute quickie, directed by Jack Hill and Stephanie Rothman, is about as odd an entry as I've seen in this type of movie. It's set in Venice CA. though much of the architecture seems European. It involves an artist who is the descendant of another, centuries earlier, artist who was put to death for witchcraft, though somehow it caused him to turn into a vampire. He now paints women in the throes of death, kills them and dips them in acid.

I understand this was culled from other movies which explains having two directors and why the villain has two separate visages. But those other movies must have been pretty bad as they still only ended up with a 62 minute flick. The black and white cinematography, particularly in the night scenes, is stunning. And the story contains some odd notes. How many movies have you seen that try to fuse art with quantum physics? And one of the scenes is set up as though it were one of Salvidor Dali's paintings. It's a real eye opener. There is some fun jabbing at the sensibilities of artists and some pretty good cheese cake in the form of Lori Saunders in a bikini.

It's cool seeing Sid Haig in his early days but, like much of the rest of the movie, it's just a curiosity. The whole thing doesn't quite hang together. Plus, the villain resides in a church tower his ancestor resided in in the 11th century. Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't believe there was a United States in the 11th century. Still, though, this is a lot of fun and it's short enough and whacked enough to warrant the attention of ardent film fans.",3.0,0

Shot on location in Australia, the series had excellent production values. The sets and costumes gave it an air of period authenticity. The acting was excellent. The convicts, men and women were suitably grubby.. So, what was the problem?

The scripts were simply sub-par. Melodramatic, with overlays of twenty first century social and sexual mores that effectively kill any authenticity of time and place, the writing is what finished off any chance of a second season.

The blades are wide, so--when open wide--they don't fit between my small dog's toenails and threaten to bite into his pads.

But, for large dogs, this is a nice pair of clippers:  Very sharp blades, nicely beveled; the blades close smoothly, and the handles are easy to grip--if you have large hands.

I have long fingers and these handles, while easy to close, are kind of hard for me to get my hand around.

SIZE INFORMATION:  I'm adding this information based on a question I received in the comment section:
""Refer to the second and third picture down: Opened up, the handles 4 11/16"" from outside edge to outside edge. A tape measure all the way around the open handle shows 11 1/8"". At the blade end: Opened up, 1 1/4"" outside-to-outside of blades; 7/16 inside-to-inside of blades.""

"Home automation seems to be one of the biggest raves talked about in today's electronic industry. Unfortunately, it has not yet reached a point where it is affordable enough for people on limited budgets. Enter this magnificent product. This product comes with the three receivers and one remote. The receivers are pretty large - they plug directly into an outlet and then you plug something into the receiver. I would not recommend using these on a power strip as they will cover at least two outlets and take up too much space. I use these primarily for light fixtures and fans. It's nice to not have to go in awkward places to turn devices on - instead, you just push a button on the remote. Although they are overall convenient and a great idea, the size of the receivers and the limited reception of the receivers from the remote signal (which can be blocked by thick walls or dense objects) can be a major downside. However, if you are only using these in one room, you should be fine. That being said, I would still recommend these. Jump into the future of technology with some indoor wireless outlet controllers. They're fun and affordable and can save you lots of time bending over to turn things on.",4.0,0

"George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Andy Garcia and Matt Damon head a super-cast of stars (among others, Julia Roberts and Don Cheadle -both of them, second timers with director Steven Soderbergh from Erin Brokovich and Traffic, respectively) in a movie about... yes, the traditional robbery theme! Seen it before? Yep! Clooney (Danny Ocean), yet in another ex-convict role (remember ""O, Brother...""?), leads a gang of eleven experts to rob three Las Vegas casinos. Sounds like a familiar plot? Perhaps, but Oscar-winning director Steven Soderbergh manages to pull off a movie that's very entertaining. Not that it's in any way related to the plot of the 1992 movie, but it reminded me of the movie ""Sneakers"" where Robert Redford gathered a group of experts as well... That's where the similarities stop. Then it is very much like Traffic, in its overall feel, music, and even part of the concept. 'Nuf said! Check it out!

"I'm a Huge fan of Will & Grace. I think it is without a doubt one of the best shows on TV. That said this season was about 50/50, and for a show that's previous seasons were 90/10 that doesn't say much. This season for some reason the shows creators decided it was time for Grace to get married. They chose Harry Connick Jr. as her love interest Leo. This decision threw the show completely off the course, and in my eyes changed what the show was about. Two friends.....It became more about Grace getting married, being a newlywed, and trying to deal with a husband that wasn't around quite so much. Karen and Jack remain hilarious as always. Jack continues his career of being a struggleing actor and Karen divorces Stan after discovering he was having an affair with Minnie Driver who was suprisingly HILARIOUS.

The one thing that I will say about this season is that it has some of the funniest episodes of the series. Mainly the season finale which features Karen, Will, Grace, and Jack putting Stan to rest at sea. Without giving away too too much two of the characters go overboard, someone might be cheating, and two characters end up in bed together. By far one of the funniest episodes EVER!

It has been two years and the switch is still working great.

Update:
I wrote an email to Leviton's complaint department after my switch stopped working and after reading all of the negative reviews.  The next day a nice lady called me and told me that they did have a manufacturing quality problem with these but corrected the problem over a year ago so I must have received old stock from the store that was never shipped back.  She said she would ship me a replacement and not to worry about returning the defective one.  The GFCI switch arived a few days later and has been working great since.  I will be sure to come back and update this review if the switch fails again.  Thank you Leviton for doing the right thing.

"This thing is legit.  It's like the extinguishers you used to see in schools.  I think few government buildings keep them around anymore, having gone to dry chemical extinguishers as codes become more and more restrictive.  I do have typical ABC extinguishers in my garage and kitchen, but I bought this to have upstairs to fight my way to my kids' rooms in that fire that wakes you up in the middle of the night--you know, then one where  you hear the smoke detector going off and open your bedroom door to find your hallway walls and carpet completely involved.  I have no doubt this will work great for that.  I don't plan on having to extinguish any grease or chemical fires in the upstairs portion of my home.  Note that it requires a 100 psi compressor to charge (or a really good manual pump).  I opted to use my little compressor which coincidentally kicks off at 100 psi.  When re-attempting to get that last few psi in there, it did spit a little water back into the air hose, which is not ideal.  I recommend either using a sturdy hand pump or a compressor which is regulated to something well above 100 psi.
In an age where everything is made in China, and expected to be tossed out after a year, it's refreshing to find a quality American-made product which should last a lifetime.

"I've had this model for several years and was delighted to find a replacement(s) on Amazon.  They are BIG and 2 of them are perfect for our 4 indoor cats.  I remove the flap in front *and* the upper part of the flap on top (needs some muscling to remove the latter).  2/3s of one of the 38lb green plastic containers of litter from CostCo fills it somewhat deeply.  I clean once a day and backfill litter as necessary.  I do not use the locking mechanisms (see removing flaps!).  One plus to this container is that I have a cat that -tho fixed- occasionally likes to pee while semi-standing up (not true spraying).  The back of the bottom pan is higher than the front which really helps.

Forgot - If you have a very large cat, removing the top part of the flap is key....

LATER 2/28/16 - decided to keep the top part for one box as our female cat is shyer .... ALSO .... you will get a teench of leakage if a tall cat stands absolutely upright to pee (maybe I should have kept both top portions?)  I also plan to try a ""top entry"" box for the schnook.",5.0,0

The problem is that as a larger breed, she was simply too long.  She could easily curl her body enough that she could get to the stitches around the donut without much of a problem at all.  So it was pretty useless for it's intended purpose.  But that's partly my fault for getting the wrong size.  It would have helped if they listed the outer diameter of the donut as well.  For reference, the medium is about 10-11 inches wide on the pup.  The donut itself is about 3.75 inches fully inflated.

"A dozen years ago, this Arnold Schwarzenegger action flick was fairly hot stuff but I wonder if it would have the impact today since special effects continue to be so much better and we've seen so many of these type of action stories in the past 12 years?

One of Arnold's keys to his successful career in films was simply that his movies were entertaining, and that's why people come to the theaters. High-brow national critics often forget that. ""Eraser"" is a prime example. Entertainment alone is how this particular movie survives since common logic doesn't exist here and violence and profanity are overdone. But, despite it's low-brow tastes and stupidity, it's still generally fun to watch if you can put your brain on hold for two hours. It's also fun to hear, too, if you have a nice surround system.

This movie has one of the most outrageous action scenes I've ever seen on film, even to this day: one in which Arnold hangs from the outside of a jet airplane, finally lets go, free-falls to catch his parachute that had been ripped off, and then has to worry about the jet plane which had circled around and was going to smash him!!

The audio came into play nicely each time the super rifle that was featured in the movie was shot. Vanessa Williams plays the female lead satisfactorily and James Caan is very effective as the villain. Robert Pastorelli and James Coburn also add to the fun. A few laughs along the way help this no-brainer to become even more entertaining.",4.0,0

I bought a set of 25' Coleman 4ga Booster Cables with it and they fit without a problem!  So just about any jumper cable size and length combo should prove to work as well.  There are two sleve style compartments on the sides.  Good perhaps for a set of flat tools such as a wrench or plyers or good for gloves.  The stiching on the handles is top to bottom so I don't fear those coming loose.  The zippers are good heavy stock so they should last as well.

One more word of advice save the twist ties that come with your cables, and if they don't come with them get some.  Twist tying them before storage will help the bag keep them nice, neat, and flat.  And the bag will keep those monster clamps from hooking everything around them!

After about a year of use with the bulb I decided to give it a try. It is so bright that I am not using it in the dark, so it is not that bright. I have been using it in a dark room for about a year now. The light is so strong that it is blinding the most sensitive of the eye. It is bright enough to see in a dark room, but not so bright that it causes vision problems. It is very easy to adjust the brightness of the light. The light is very bright, which is why I put it in a dimmed light and put it in a dimmed light. I put it in a dimmed light and put it in a bright light.

"This is a very bright light that is marred by an oversimplified design on the elastic cord that hold the lights in place. But let's start at the beginning. This is a very nice Energizer headset that could have been a lot better except for American corporate insistence on not quite getting things as well as they might have.  They list their light at 150 lumens, which is respectable and serviceable, but certainly not one of the  brightest headsets on the markets. They claim to have made a technological adjustment that makes this four times brighter. But they aren't clear about this. If this is four times brighter, that would mean it is a 600 lumens. If it is 600 lumens, then why not say it? I suspect because it really is just a 150 lumens headset, but they want you to think it is rather more. Regardless, this bright enough for most lighting needs. Where it fails is the headband. I have a couple of other headlamps, and in both instances they constructed the headset with several pieces of elastic. This allows for a couple of things. It provides a more stable perch on the head, which it most certainly provides. It also provides a more comfortable perch for the headlamp. This is simply not a very comfortable headset to wear. The lone band really cuts into your skin when holding it. If you tried to wear this on your head  for any length of time you would begin to experience discomfort and most probably a pressure headache.

This is not a bad headlamp, but there are much better ones available for just about any need.

This classic film, made even as the war clouds were gathering in Europe and armies on the march in Asia, is well-acted and an excellent adaptation of the original novel. I even love the lamasery, even though it seems more art deco than Tibetan.

"I first saw this tool, it was an inexpensive and powerful saw. I have a large collection of other tools and this is the one.  The blade is a solid, strong, straight edge.  It is not stiff like a regular saw.  I use it to cut concrete with no problems.  I have the most common type of saw and it is a solid blade.  I use it on most of my projects and for small projects.  It is very versatile.  I have had no problems with the saw.  I am very pleased with this tool.

Pros:
-Good for work
-Excellent for small projects
-Lightweight
-Doesn't seem to take up a lot of room

Cons:
-No grip on the saw, but it is sturdy

"My fiancee was nice enough to buy me an aquarium for two years ago, complete with filters, cartridges, submersible heater, air pump, etc. I received an Aqueon QuietFlow Filter with my gift, and knowing nothing much about the types of filters that existed, I thought it was fantastic. Now, a little over two years later I know a lot more about fishkeeping and supplies, and I still think my Aqueon is a great HOB filter. It works on my tank alongside an AquaClear 50 gal filter, and the setup more than meets my expectations.

The filter cartridges, however, are terribly expensive. The only ""LFS"" (if you can even call it that) in my area is a PetSmart, and while I try to avoid that store, I have two cats, so I'm there more than I'd like to be. Eventually I wander to the fish section, and I surrender my wallet and its contents to the cashier. This same 12-Pack of cartridges at the store is around $42. I get the same exact thing on Amazon for a little over $20, with tax added. I rarely spend less than $35 on this crazy site, so I usually get free shipping, so that's another expense I am not accounting for.

I get six more filters online for the same price it costs me to get a 6-pack at the store. Crazy!

"Considering all the tools in my garage, this planer and the Dewalt 12"" sliding compound miter are the best investments I have made.

I purchased this from Amazon on Jan 26, and it was delivered on Jan 30.  This is a good compromise of size and cutting capacity for a home or garage workshop.  I bought a dust collection adaptor to fit this to my shop vac, even though it says not to.  It fills up my shop vac pretty quickly, but it works.  I use very small increments of wood removal, and am able to get wood planed down to a perfect .500"" when measured with a dial caliper.  For fitting into 1/2"" cut dados, I couldn't be happier.

"One thing I find a bit inconvenient about this food is that I have to have a spoon or fork to get it out of the can with.  That's a trade off, because that means it's not all gravy and the cats get more real food for the catfood buck.  I also have to always chop it up because if I don't, my cats just look at it like ""What is this strange thing, mama?  You expect me to do what- exactly- with this?""

After chopping it up, the cats like it just fine.  I wouldn't say they love it.  They don't dance around when I open the can.  It's almost like they can't really tell what it is right off.  Once they realize it is food, they eat it all readily.

It has agreed well with my oldest, sickly cat.  She has breast cancer and a very sensitive tummy.  She hasn't thrown up eating it and she's been acting like she feels very good.  She's been totally curious about everything I do and very active.

"This is not a film for everyone. It sets up a challenging mix of expectations and continually crosses from one genre's conventions to another. It is definitely for film lovers who like something far out of the ordinary. Set in war-time Japan, this story of a doctor literally on the run in his efforts to unravel the mystery of an epidemic of hepatitis among his patients, could be taking place anywhere in this war-torn world today. Resources are in short supply, and everywhere there is violence and fear triggered by the embrace of militarism. The doctor, a heroic figure, is surrounded in this film by the outcasts of society - a prostitute, an opium addict, an escaped prisoner of war. Cheered by recognition from his colleagues in the medical profession that his work is valued and important, he is left with little to make a difference in the world, except his determination to do the best he can.

The sudden shifts of mood in the film, the use of a noisy jazz score, the outbursts of violence, scenes of sexual tension, the heartfelt moments as characters reach out with tenderness to each other, all provide a jumble of conflicting impressions that reflect the chaotic world it mirrors. There's not a single point of view in the film though it ends emphatically with the detonation of an atomic bomb on the horizon, as the doctor and his assistant float in an open boat in the sea (an image that brings to mind the end of Ingmar Bergman's ""Shame""). The film cries out to be viewed again for there is much too much to absorb in a single viewing.",4.0,0

"These two movies give Johnny Depp a great opportunity to show his acting range, and he doesn't disappoint.

""Sleepy Hollow"" is perhaps the definitive film version of this well-known tale, though it is not for the faint-of-heart. It gets pretty gory, what with the Headless Horseman out and about his business. We tend to watch this film around Halloween...then see if we can get over its ghastly images by Xmas.

I saw ""Sweeney Todd"" on Broadway with Len Cariou, Angela Lansbury and Victor Garber many years ago. Cariou and Lansbury were spectacular. Garber, not so much - Sondheim's music for the male ingenue role is pretty ungracious, and neither Garber nor Jamie Campbell Bower in this film version has any success negotiating the vocal writing.

Depp's film Sweeney is a great deal more-frightening and disturbed than what I saw on B'way. That's possible in large part because he doesn't have to project his singing voice and stage persona into a live theatrical space (truth is Depp's singing voice wouldn't project well into the open space of a typical B'way theater without major amplification). That makes for a more-intimate, more-human portrayal, and it's fairly disturbing. The rest of the cast is good as well.

Both films were directed by Tim Burton who seems to get the best out of Depp. The ""By The Sea"" sequence in Sweeney is particularly touching in fleshing out the human sides of Todd and Mrs Lovett that might have been in a way that just isn't possible in the staged version.

If you want to enjoy Sweeney as a disturbed horror flick, get this version. If your main interest is hearing the music, get the 1982 ""Tribute"" version with Lansbury and George Hearn.

I put my bull dog on this product and was certainly seeing nice muscle tone but my dog is pretty sensitive and she started getting acid reflux and having issues so I was not able to continue using the product but I would say for the couple weeks she was able to use it I did notice good result with her body structure and her energy levels were nice and her skin and coat looked good. She has a lot of allergies naturally so this just wasn't something she could take but if you don't have a sensitive dog I would recommend it because it does have great ingredients and no fillers.,3.0,0

My two small dogs play a lot and if they happen to skid on the tray while running, the pad would move and they would grab it and rip it apart!
Also, my Pomeranian has a liver condition and as a result he drinks a ton of water and pees a lot! So he always ends up with wet paws, which meant he wet the floor every time he used the pee pad.

"Every review I've read has been quasi-negative but not being one to listen to critics, I took a chance.  I was very pleasantly surprised.  Depending on why you go to a movie, you may not like this because it is not escapism.  It deals with real life issues and things most of us can relate to.  I found the movie to be very refreshing and all the characters real to life.  The main character is a single mom trying to raise a precocious son.  She has to deal with a dead-end relationship and an aging father, an irresponsible sister and a job she hates.  How she copes and what she does is more believable than most of the ""chick flick"" films out today.  I think this is one of the better movies in a sea of fluff to spend time and money on.

"I like this product as it works better on dog toenails than toenail clippers.  I just received the product today and ordered it b/c a neighbor who owns a larger Bully type dog uses the Dremel on his dog's toenails rather than toenail clippers.  The Dremel is easy to use and the instructions are clear and concise.  The dog (98 lb Labrador) was very calm while I sanded his toenails usually he fights me all the way when using toenail clippers.  The only drawback to this product is that the battery life isn't very long.  I was able to complete two paws or 8 toenails and 2 dewclaws before the battery ran down.  The charger plugs directly into an electrical socket and the battery is easily removed from the Dremel.  The Dremel is easy to hold in your hand and maneuverable so I like that attribute.  I would suggest wearing goggles or glasses and a carbon mask due to the amount of dust produced and get a grittier sandpaper if your dogs toenails are very long or over 1/4"" thick.  I noticed that they do sell Mandrels, drums and other types of attachments for the Dremel and different gradations of sandpaper etc.  This product is much better than that battery run ""As Seen On TV"" thing that I purchased, used one time and threw in the trash.",5.0,0

"I'm going to review this movie for 1 reason only, and it's for the HDR (4k release) content. My opinion on the movie itself is too subjective, and some people just hate Zach Snyder so they won't watch this movie anyways. Anyhow, let's talk about the HDR, and you're buying this for the upgraded visuals. Let me tell you something, the last half of the movie is SIMPLY STUNNING and if you have a newer 4k television with the ability to handle HDR correctly, you'll be in for a visual treat. This is the movie you show to people that have not seen 4k and HDR before, because the colors and contrast pops so much it's stunning. You're literally going to be amazed how bright some objects in the scenes look. Zach Snyder is known for loving his darker scenes, and this movie is very dark in tone and in plot, but then he amazes us with a visual treat when the action  picks up and that dark mood is met with explosions, bright glowing kryptonite, and heat vision eye blasts. If there was a way to capture the image to prove this to you, I would do so and upload it. For now, you need the right type of UHD HDTV that is calibrated and can handle HDR content, and you'll know exactly what I'm talking about. The movies for 4k with HDR are lacking right now, and you want to show off? Pick up this title, because even if you aren't a fan of the plot, you WILL be a fan of showing this off to others.",5.0,0

Bert litter system in the world.  I've had this before and they improved the product.  The holes are smaller so the pellets don't get stuck. This is worth every penny.

"Would be a 5 but unlike headlights that use batteries which gradually grow dimmer, when this needs to be charged, it literally shuts down.  So if you're out in the woods on a dark night, you have nothing.  Could be scary and even dangerous.  One note that can be either positive or negative is that the beam is pretty focused, more of a spot than a flood, so you can see far in advance.  I like it, so a positive for me.  Living in AK, I never go anywhere in the winter without a headlight.  Most of the time I only use the low beam, which is plenty to find my way around.

"Although this movie has a far bigger ambition than budget, it still manageed to delight and entertain me throughout all of its 89 minutes.  It's by far the best movie THE ASYLUM has produced yet and while it certainly isn't up to the production standards of big budget hollywood stuff, it is often far more entertaining than the overblown hype Michael Bay and his ilk come up with.  Honestly, the movie has a very striking, almost psychodelic look with loads of wild, garish lighting and lurid color schemes.  The editing is fast and frantic and the visual effects are occasionally almost passable.  The acting is over the top (and lots of fun) and the script is really out there.  I  truly enjoyed and appreciated this thing a lot. The DVD transfer is especially excellent and on an upconverting DVD player it often approaches bluray picture quality.  The super aggressive Dolby 5.1 surround sound will also give your subwoofer a real workout (although dialog is sometimes a bit distorted). Plenty of surround effects as well for an emersive experience. The premise of this one is so goofy and it moves along with a giddy speed that kept me smiling from start to finish.  I loved it.",5.0,0

"This could have been great. Unfortunately the most important feature is useless. The belt clip seems tight and springy, but put in your belt and it slips off with almost no effort. Someone suggested taping it, which is a poor (and ugly) fix. My solution was to drill through the metal clip and rivet it. Just insert a wooden block, drill through the clip, remove the block, insert a rivet from the inside, replace the block, add the cap and hammer it home. It doesn't interfere with the tool at all.

But, speaking of the tool - While this has become my fave for every day use, the CS4 has tools on the outside and they snag the case when you try to insert the tool. I have a Blast, which I use for work, and a Rebar, which lives in my wife's car. Both tools have their bladess mounted INSIDE the handles.

Your heart rate will go up, your legs will look fantastic. There is are rotations available to get maximum results. Again, regardless of your age or size or time, this will do the trick. [and supplement with the downloads! 93+ and counting!].

"STORY: Glenn Ford stars as the rancher Smith, who is driving his family to frustration with his gentle procrastinating ways that have kept the farm from doing well. The hay needs to be cut, and he is distracted with his ongoing friendships with a local Nez Perce Native American tribe. When a tribal member is wrongly accused of murder, Smith comes to his defense. As a sign of the tribe's gratitude, they help train a horse from the ranch, and they help get the hay crop in on time.

BEHIND THE SCENES: Live action Disney classic. Keenan Wynn, Nancy Olson, and Chief Dan George also star in this movie, and a good song written by Bobby Russell for the movie is featured, ""The Ballad of Smith and Gabriel Jimmyboy"". While production was started initially by James Algar, Bill Anderson took over as producer fairly early. One of the studios greatest producers, Anderson saw the fim as a chance to appeal to a more mature audience that a typical Disney film, vital to Disney's growth. Directed by Michael O'Herlihy. The story had been adapted by studio staff storyman Louis Pelletier from a book by Paul St. Pierre titled, ""Breaking Smith's Quarter Horse"". This movie was released to theaters on March 21, 1969, and was released on video in 1987. It never featured on ""The Wonderful World of Disney"" television show. It is 102 minutes in length.

Released almost two years after Walt's death, this film was almost unseen by the public since a top studio executive hated the film based on only a few scenes. He cut all funding for promotion of the film so there was no audience waiting to see it. Even a good review in the LA Times did not help bring the viewers in and it was out of theaters before the word of mouth could send in the crowds. I recommend this hidden little film from the Disney vault.",5.0,0

"I know:  many viewers resented the apparent lack of physical chemistry between the characters played by Connery and Zeta-Jones.  Most of them had vivid memories of Sean Connery playing the always charismatic 007, and  Catherine Zeta-Jones exchanging sparks with Antonio Banderas in The Mask of  Zorro. But is chemistry between a man and a woman just, physical, sensual,  and sexual ?  I find the movie entertaining, as it shows 2 people  enjoying doing what they like best - no, I am not saying you should do the  same thing ! - but as it happens in life, people perform so much better  when they really like what they do.  The chemistry is between Zeta-Jones  youth, outgoing passion for life and Connery's less evident, more inward  quest for adventure which is backed up by his wisdom and longtime  experience.  As they go about doing and accomplishing things together, the  old man develops respect and acknowledges the younger woman's worth.  Slowly he starts to like her and, despite his age, or, perhaps because of  his age, he feels that, to a certain extent he cares for her.  While, at  the same time, she turns from intellectually admiring him to actually  liking him on her side. Admittedly, it is an uneasy chemistry between  Connery, the Scott gentleman and Catherine, the Welsh with long brown hair  and eyes, but the film offers enjoyable action moments interspersed with  occasionally good dialogue and exchanges between the two leads.  Watch and  enjoy the movie, as I did, for what it is not for what it is not !",4.0,0

"This is the dictionary of bellydance- 2 discs- she goes through standing moves, traveling moves, veil and zill introductions, and some combinations.  Very useful and it is voiced over- she doesn't stop moving, the narration explains what she is doing.  I like how she doesn't dissect things to the point where you can't foresee what you trying to do.  She does the movements up to speed, slows a little, but for the most part you have every idea of what you are trying to do and that, in my opinion, is more helpful than drastic breakdowns.  Beautiful variety of costumes, Jehan illustrates that you don't have to have a model's figure to be a gorgeous sexy dancer- she is so beautiful!

I recomend that you also get 'the ultimate bellydance workout' with this dvd set because that dvd is fantastic and this set explains what the dancers in the other dvd are doing.  If you have the other and were discouraged because you couldn't quite get how they were doing certain moves, this dvd set explains it all.",5.0,0

"Having an elderly cat (18) and two younger cats, we were running into issues where the regular food was to hard for my old fellow to chew, and in a very short period of time, he lost a lot of muscle, dropping from 17 pounds to only 10. I tried some specialty ""older cat"" food that stopped the weight loss, but of course both of the younger guys (a 22 pound Ragdoll and a 16 pound tabby mix) thought that the food the elder got was best, and protested their food, too. And, of course, the food is OUTRAGEOUSLY expensive to feed to three large cats, two of which are super active.

Evolve was the fix. It is soft enough that the old guy's soft gums don't complain, and as a plus, we've seen a major difference in cleanup requirements, as none of the cats upchuck or have diarrhea anymore, and the large dander (cat dandruff!) has all but disappeared. We still use a wet food supplement for the older cat (which, of course, the young guys love, too) to maintain his weight and health until he passes, but we are in the region now where we won't have to auction off one of our teenagers just so we can feed the cats!",5.0,0

"Wow, I cut a small dog off my dog!  I used to cut my kids' hair when they were little and they always threatened to hold me down and cut mine one day.  Photos will show I was not good at it.  So with clippers and a dog, what could go wrong?  The dog, a shaggy little Border Terrier who had a 7 month growth of hair.  Never having been a good one for reading instructions, I jumped in and started playing with blade guards.  The middle one was the best place to start and then I started testing guards to see which one cut closer.

After an hour and lots of fun, there was a small dog of hair on the ground, but my real dog still looked like she could lose a little more hair.  Hey, it will grow back, right?

My back took a rest while I had a cool drink, then I plopped the dog on the patio table (duh, should have done this to begin with) and started cutting with just the clippers and no guard.  Whoohoo, first cut took out a divot.  Damn, these things are really cool.  As I developed a smoother stroke, we ended up with a really passable haircut.

What I learned: do not cut a wet dog and it will grow back.

I saved about $40 bucks for a haircut and had an immeasurable amount of fun.  Now, what else can I trim?  The other 3 dogs are all short haired, but wait....hey cat, come back here!",5.0,0

UltraHD Lighted Work Center: Easy to put together and very sturdy, LED work light and adjustable leveling feet. GREAT BENCH. And this is what I expect from Seville Classics.

UltraHD Cushioned Pneumatic Work Stool: Very easy to put together and adjusts to the correct height for the bench. Do not overly care for the small back rest but it it ok. One small issue, it only has 4 wheels, they really should have had a 5th wheel, as it has already slipped out from under me once already. Be careful not to sit on the edge too quickly

Optional 3"" Wheels for UltraHD Work Center: Bad purchase. It not only raises the bench 4 inches, you are now sitting 4 inches lower on the bench. I am 5' 10"" and I had a hard time sitting above the table to work on items. I would save the hassle and $34 on these.",5.0,0

First complaint was there were no installation instructions included. Even the website didn't offer any help, offering just an email to contact.

Second, this was apparently designed to be attached directly to the ceiling and not to a ceiling electrical box as it did not come with the right parts. The cover for the ceiling was also barely big enough to cover the standard-size box I had. After messing around with extra screws and brackets, I did manage to get it installed quite nicely, no thanks to the included accessories.

Third, the set screw that you tighten down to hold the cord in the lamb base is nylon and stripped out with almost no pressure.

"When I first saw Twilight in 1998 I knew I was watching a valuable classic. We need a few more like Twilight these days to add intelligence that recent movies with action and adventure lack.  We need less high-tech-special-affects and more intriguing dialogue which includes humor, wit and wisdom that Twilight provides in abundance.
Listing the cast only was enough for me to go see the film : Paul Newman,
Gene Hackman, Susan Sarandon, James Garner, Stockard Channing, and with a
supporting cast of not-so-well-known actors who add to Twilight's appeal.
Among them (is/was) the late John Spencer, best known as the president's
secretary or chief aid in the TV series West End. Also, Reese Witherspoon
got an opportunity in this film playing the prodigal daughter of
Hackman/Sarandon. There are a few others who play character parts too.
I like the sophisticated decadence of Hollywood which Twilight so cleverly portrays with its sex, money, murder and cover-ups that are unearthed by Paul Newman, playing an aging ex-cop turned private-eye  which implicate friends and foes alike.
Here is a movie about old friendships, soon to be lost lives, and lost
illusions about life and love, that, in my opinion, make Twilight a modern classic for some soon-to-be ""late"" actors we have learned to love so much over the past fifty years.",4.0,0

Now you really don't need a ton of instructions if you know in general what you are doing. But seriously, no instructions on their website? What is this 1998?
As far as the product it looks good when you are done, but there are some issues.
-The returns fit inside the rails and they recommend using silicone to glue them in place. They sit pretty far out from the wall which sort of defeats the purpose. ( they are to keep from people catching clothing or other things over the railing and that causing a fall) the returns stood out I would say 3/4 of an inch. (I should have measured but did not)
-They are hard to get to fit nice and tight against the pipe. This goes about 2x for the knuckle joint if you use that I used wide masking tape to hold them in place.
- The email I received in response to my request for install specs or instructions was a zip file that contained a virus according to Yahoo mail. I tried to download another copy they sent to my phone and I was warned that it wanted to ""install an application from an unknown source"" then It wanted some admin privileges??

ADVANTAGES:  It's easy to put the two halves together by matching tabs to slots. It has a hinged cover over the lock, unlike the Safety 1st which has just an opening. Once assembled, it generally prevents children from turning the doorknob while allowing adults to do so by simultaneously pressing the two ""levers"" on the sides and twisting. DISADVANTAGE #1: A child might be able to separate the two halves (although this item is more resistant to breakage than the Safety 1st covers). ""HACK"" #1: Use a strong glue (like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Henkel-01-82196-Loctite-2-Gram-Super-Glue-Gel/dp/B000ALBZGC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Henkel 01-82196 Loctite 2-Gram Super Glue Gel</a>) on the tabs to keep the cover intact (but not so much glue that you won't be able to remove the cover later!). DISADVANTAGE #2: On certain doorknobs, the rubber-like pads inside the cover might grip the knob too tightly, so that a child will be able to open the door with only moderate effort. ""HACK"" #2: Apply a small amount of silicone lubricant (like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/10141WD-11oz-3-in-1-Pro-Lubricant-Silicone-Spray-Aerosol-Can-SHIP-GROUND-ONLY-ORM-D/dp/B000BBYCUC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">10141WD 11oz 3-in-1 Pro Lubricant Silicone Spray Aerosol Can *SHIP GROUND ONLY* ORM-D</a>) to the pads inside.

With my 80 pound lab it is very difficult to guide him while holding the ramp in place with my foot.

"There are many options out there for small aquariums.  So many questions.  Glass or acrylic... tall and skinny or short and long.... what kind of filter....  As a prior aquarium owner of both fresh and salt, starting with a 10 gal and working my way up to a 75, I have some experience with tanks and took a 10-year hiatus.  In 2010, my young son won a gold fish at the local state fair (imagine my dismay - a GOLDfish?  A dirty bottom feeder? ugh - haha).  We purchased a small 1-gal tank and needed to move up when this fish continued to grow and thrive!  We purchased this Eclipse tank because it was seamless (so I didn't need to worry about leaks on the dresser) and we liked the domed-front which actually makes the tank appear bigger than it is.  I have seen comments that some people don't like having to take the entire top off to maintain the tank, however, if you are going to see this tank from the TOP (which you will on a desktop or dresser), I cannot express how ***absolutely amazing*** it is to have one smooth top versus a hood with a filter sticking out of the back.  The tank is quiet and stays very clean, even with our two enormous goldfish.  We do a 25% water change every 5-6 weeks and rinse the filter cartridge out about every 2-3 weeks (or whenever needed).  Goldie and Diego are so huge now that we are looking for a bigger tank (again).  I've been out there looking (since there are 10 gal setups available for less than the Eclipse system - even an LED one from Marineland), however, we have decided to purchase the 12 gal Eclipse system - largely because of the fully enclosed top.  This is an excellent looking tank and I recommend it highly.",5.0,0

Granted, it's not supposed to be jumped on; in hindsight, the cloth tent is not a good option for cats that are naturally going to jump on surfaces.  Also, the sides of the litterbox lid get stuck on the sides of the tent so opening the lid is not smooth.  The window at the back of the tent that is supposed to allow you to get to the buttons and settings is a joke.  Not only is it difficult to see what the settings are, but there's no way you can stick your hand into the tent AND see what you're doing at the same time.

"We got this as an upgrade to our current Sentry Fire-Safe which is older (circa 2000), smaller, and doesn't have a water rating. At first feel, the dial felt a bit cheap and clunky as it didn't spin smoothly (it was like you could feel it catch every so often) but it didn't hamper the use of the safe at all. I'm not sure if I love or hate the clicking sounds as you rotate the dial (my last one was silent so am used to that). I hope to never worry about needing to unlock it in a perfectly quiet manner.

Regarding the keys, I'm not sure what the other reviewers are talking about--you don't NEED the keys to lock the safe. I locked mine just fine without the key: just close the safe, raise the lever, and spin the dial...and it's locked. The key just adds another layer of security--once you lock the safe with the dial, you use the key to turn the key-lock from Unlocked to Locked. But, thinking I might have missed something (after reading a few reviews) I just specifically went back to test it...and confirmed you do not need the key to securely lock the safe. Right now, my keys are locked in the safe and I can get in and out just fine.

I do like all the room in the safe, but would have liked a drawer (like the one that came with my other safe) or at least another shelf. I was also blessed with a super easy combination, so I'm thrilled with that.

Overall, a very nice safe for the price.",4.0,0

"So I just got these tonight. I didn't necessarily like the price per bulb but hey these are the best I found on Amazon for what I need. ..  I got these bulbs to replace some other LED candle porch light I bought about six months ago. I was going to update and give a really bad review for my last bulbs as they burnt out within six months from running them over night. You do the math but I think you'll find that doesnt add up to 10,000 hours. But that was the old bulbs. These new ones are a different company and style, they are round at the tip, without the fancy angled candle tip some have. But I'm willing to give up fancy tips for a bulb that lights well. It says soft white and it matches better to my other yellowish bulb than my previous bulbs that were more bright white. Hard to explain bulb color in the dark but I'll post some pics.

As mentioned, I barely got these bulbs, but was super impressed with the color vs my old bulbs.  It looks more like a soft porch light than my old. I plan to update at a future time, gotta make sure these babies last.  First impression is buy them, good porch light color, I'll warn you if they don't last.",5.0,0
"I got this in the August Blockhead Box (a dog subscription box).  I have the ""large"" version and, for the record, my dog is an 83-84 pound Rottweiler who is super destructive.

This lasted my dog longer than a lot of cloth-covered toys (I hesitate to call it ""plush"" because it's not particularly soft and doesn't have stuffing).  As in, like five minutes.  Part of the reason was she had a bit of trouble picking it up, but I'm not blaming that on the toy, I'm blaming it on my dog.  She kept trying to pick it up by the middle, while one of her feet was holding the outside part down...anyway, she did eventually get it up.

My dog has the uncanny ability to find the weak point in any toy.  In this case, it is the embroidered KONG logo.  She started gnawing on that after a few minutes and I did eventually have to take it away because she put a few small holes in it near the logo.  For what it's worth, she did LOVE this toy and was sad to have it taken away, and it held up pretty well to tugging.  Also, although there are squeakers, she really didn't squeak this too much (for once, much to my relief...).

In the end, maybe this is not for the heaviest of chewers, but I have no doubt it would work for some dogs (like my last Rottie, who was very gentle with toys).  The large is appropriate for large breed dogs.  Although my dog is on the small side for a Rottie, I would feel comfortable giving this to a dog 20 or 30 pounds heavier, as well.  I would definitely supervise at first, especially if you know your dog is destructive.",3.0,0

"Here's a film where Seagal doesn't just go through those regular paces we all love him for, which is probably why most of the viewers reviewing this film here are disappointed.  I wasn't disappointed at all, and next to Under Siege, this is my favorite Seagal movie.  Not just because of the beautiful scenery, not just because Seagal plays a doctor who cares more about helping his patients get well than he does getting paid, not just because he gives both the government officials and the militia-extremists a real piece of his mind. Not even because of the role that Native American traditions and healing methods play in this film.

Maybe for all those things.  Or maybe because this take-no-prisoners 'tough guy' is a fine role model of a terrific father to his daughter in this film. It's a real treat to see this side of Seagal and it adds a dimension to his character that makes this more than just an action movie.

Meanwhile, there are plenty of enemies to defeat here, and Seagal defeats them all -- including the 'invisible enemy' of biochemical disease.  Not bad, not bad at all.  Better than good in fact.

You can see what I'm talking about in the product picture - where the handle is attached, you can see that circle there and how it is recessed.

The one nice thing (not that it benefitted me at all) is that this kit tries to replace both old & new Moen configurations by providing several inserts to choose from.  This way you can match it to most Moens regardless of how your current one screws in to the valve.

I have had it for a few months now and it's still very comfortable for my dog.  I have a 15 pound Maltese and it's been great for her to wear it.  I wish I would have gotten it a few months ago.  I have a 60 pound lab mix and it's been great for her to wear it.  I'm not sure how she is adjusting to this,3.0,1

"Mall Rats may not be Oscar-worthy per se, but its till worth watching if you're a Kevin Smith fan. The film stars both Ben Affleck and former skateboarder Jason Lee in their film debuts.

The plot: T.S. Quint (played by Jeremy London) and Brodie Bruce (played by the aforementioned Jason Lee) are two best friends, who spend too much time at their local mall, and are then dumped by their girlfriends Brandi Svenning (played by Claire Forlani) and Rene Mosier (played by Shannon Doherty) for being unemployed, immature and overall slackers. TS wants to get married to Brandi, even though he's still in college. But what stands in not only his way, but Brodie's way as well, is Brandi's father, Jared (played by Michael Rooker, of AMC's Walking Dead fame), who is hosting a game show, Truth or Date, at the duo's favorite mall. The two then ""hire"" the famed Clerks duo, Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (film's director, Kevin Smith) to not only help them get their girlfriends back, but to trash the set of said show and get it kicked off the airwaves before it premieres. In an interesting subplot, Willam Black (played by Ethan Suplee in his film debut) has been spending his spare time from opening 'til closing staring at a Magic Eye poster, which is said to be a sailboat, however, he can't see it!

The DVD: This DVD is awesome, it is double sided. It has the original theatrical version on Side A, and on Side B, an extended, unrated version of the film which runs approximately 2 hrs., 1 min. (121 min.) as opposed to the original theatrical version which runs 1 hr. 35 min. (95 min.) Aside from that, the extras are fantastic!

A must buy if you're a Kevin Smith fan!!",5.0,0

"This is probably the best grooming tool I have ever bought for my dog. I have a 130lb shepard mix and he sheds unbelievable.  This tool was recommended to me by a groomer and it works better for me then the Furminator and it is 1/3 of the price.  You do not have to press hard or tug, this glides smoothly and you will be amazed at the amount of hair that comes out.  My dog does not normally care for brushing but I have been able to get him to sit still longer and be *brushed* with this.  I would highly recommend this to anyone who has a longer hair dog that sheds alot. (plus my dog is mostly black so you see hair everywhere!)  Grooming him with this for just a few minutes a day has really cut down in the amount of hair I have to clean up all over the house from shedding.",5.0,0
"If you're a fan of the angelically irreverent Mark Twain, there's a *very* high probability you will enjoy this. It's a delightful interpretation of what Twain's lecture series performances would have been like. I particularly enjoy this performance because of the artistry of Mr. Holbrook's interpretation and delivery of Twain: Twain was supposedly the master of the comic pause for effect, and Holbrook seems a fine practitioner of that art.

Much of the material was familiar to me from reading Twain. Yet the performance certainly adds another dimension to one's enjoyment of Mark Twain's high art of civilized comedy and truthful commentary on the human condition. It is a comedy that is merciful to what is sincere and merciless to what is false - always seasoned with humility. It is a comedy, that with exceptions such as Garrison Keillor, modern America has forgotten. Twain's honesty, perspicacity, humility, and irreverence were what made him the luminary he was: The majority of modern comics only score one out of four on that list. If watching this performance motivates you to read one of Twain's books, I highly commend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Roughing-It/dp/1626360634/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Roughing It</a>.

"We had 3 of these someone gave us for xmas, or wtvr a long time ago.  So we tossed them on the survival shelf, why not right...

So, in Ohio we had no power for 9days 2 weeks back.  On the first night we broke out what lights we had & wanting to save the good batteries / flashlights, I used these as they had really good light for such a small thing.  Using one I could walk around outside quite comfortably....

Used them for 3hrs first night, 2nd as well, then questioning how long they can run on 3 AAAs I just left them on all night, still lit in the morning & then every night through the outage & only once did I change the batteries, and those were cheapo sunbeam dollar store AAAs at that...

In the end, these lil guys that no one would think twice about, REALLY DO WORK!  So, in the end of the 9days, these were sitting 3rd down as to what we need to get more of!

I did receive these as a promotion and I really like these gloves. They protect my hands from heat with a pot I took right off the stove and tried them by holding it in my hand. Didn't feel any heat transfer. The silicon grips are great too as I don't feel that my hands are going to slip. Have used them multiple times and they do not transfer heat. I haven't tried anything approaching the limit of 480 degrees but have taken pans out of a toaster oven where they are 425 and again no heat felt. They are a bit big (got the large) but I find that useful as I don't have to slip my hands in with a struggle. I have medium to large hands but the fit is probably a bit large. Again I find this a plus and not a minus. I would probably like the longer cuff for taking pans out of an oven but it is not like these are short and I don't think I will burn myself but maybe if you are a bit clumsy you might? I would totally recommend them even if I was buying them.,5.0,0

"These bags are much larger than I expected them to be.  It's been a while since I've purchased some, but I don't recall them being so big. They do the job! Makes picking up the pup's messes a lot easier, and a whole lot more sanitary. Especially for my elderly father.  He has a time trying to pick it up with toilet paper without getting it on him or something else.....these are a MUST HAVE item in my house since he's living with me. This will also save money on toilet paper.  My pup is trained to use the potty pad inside, and also to go outside. He's a pomeranian, and I trained him this way so that when it rains or snows, he will be able to go indoors. It's been so nice to not have to get all bundled up in the winter and brave the cold, snow and ice. They've already come in handy, and will last a long time. I know who to get them from now when we run out. The container to keep them in is small, and easy to clip to a belt loop or leash, and am able to grab one easily. The bags are also a good thickness. Some I've purchased in the past were a little thinner than these. If you have a pooch you need to pick up after, these are great to have on hand. They do have a slight odor, but I think it's just the plastic itself. It's not terrible, but is noticeable upon opening the box. They aren't scented with perfume, thank goodness!

"""Tonight or Never"" is one of the ten best movies about opera ever made (There have been at least 10, right?  There is ""A Night at the Opera"" and ""The Great Caruso,"" and they go to an opera in ""Pretty Woman. ""  Does that count?). Gloria Swanson plays Nella Vago, a young singer who has a rather disappointing operatic debut in Venice. Her voice teacher, Rudig (Gerdinand Gottschalk), tell here that her voice lacks warmth and feeling. Meanwhile, a young man (Melyvn Douglas) is following her around everything. Nella returns home to Budapest, where she learns that a scout from the Metropolitan Opera has refused to sign her until she can truly feel her songs. Depressed, she goes to the apartment of the young man and makes love to him. The next night Nella stuns the audience with her emotional performance in ""Tosca. ""  But now she has to choose between a career and the man she loves (apparently having both does not occur to her). Swanson is pretty good in this early talkie, especially since she is dressed up in stunning gowns by Coco Chanel, which may well be the best part of the movie. This 1931 film directed by Mervyn LeRoy was based on the play by Lili Hatvany and this would be a much better movie if it seemed less like a play. Two other interesting tidbits about ""Tonight or Never"": The cameraman was Gregg Toland, the famous cinematographer who worked with Orson Welles on ""Citizen Kane"" and the scene stealing waiter was Boris Karloff, in his first role after ""Frankenstein.",4.0,0

"Decent right angle clamp built with aluminum jaws, and steel threads.  Plenty of clearance for getting the joint spot welded, and the center clamping piece 'floats' so it will hold pieces of different thicknesses at a precise right angle.
In fact, the aluminum seems to be powder coated smoothly enough to be able to hold pieces together for things like wooden picture frames, without marring them, at least until you use them as welding clamps and get weld spatter on them.  There is even enough clearance for a nail gun, to tack the pieces together, if you would want.
Precisely made, I consider these to kind of fudge the line between light duty and medium duty as far as welding clamps go.  I checked the angle with a machinist's square, and it was right on.  Great for small or precision projects.  I would even consider them for woodworking projects, where a right angle clamp would be needed.",4.0,0

"Spider-Man 2 is better than the original Spider-Man. I feel I should get that out of the way first, since most sequels have a tough time topping the first one. However, I feel Spider-Man 2 is only better in the sense that if the same production staff remade Spider-Man, it should naturally be better. That's what this sequel feels like, a literal remake with some spiced up elements here and there. It's a good film, but it's not really the way I thought a sequel should be.

Effects are even better than the first, and the tentacles of Doc Ock make for some truly spectacular battles, including a centerpiece on a runaway train. Tobey Maguire continues to give an excellent portrayal of Peter Parker, and has good chemistry with Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane. Alfred Molina has more to work with as Doc Ock than Dafoe did as the Goblin, and humanizes what was once a wacky villain. James Franco continues to develop Harry Osborn well, and the supporting cast like JK Simmons and Rosemary Harris fill out the high-caliber acting.

But the script needs work. It uses one of the worst superhero cliches as the main plot, that of the hero calling it quits. It's never convincing, and the film drags as we wait for Peter to realize things we've known all along. Character relationships, though well-acted, don't seem to have progressed since the first movie. We're still treading the Peter/Mary Jane love triangle, just with a different third wheel. Harry still has his on/off friendship with Peter. There are nice plot twists that shake things up towards the end, but most of the film is wasted on the exact same angst from the first one. For a story supposedly set 3 years later, it might as well have been 3 days.

We get a dvd with good extras and audio/video presentation. I enjoy Spider-Man 2 on its own, and it's nice to have it in my dvd library, but as a sequel it's not fresh enough for me. Hopefully next year's Spider-Man 3 will fix that.",4.0,0

"I watched ""One Step Beyond The Official First Season"" over the past 3 days. The show is finally getting the release it deserves.

First - Let's get the only video flaw I found in the entire set out of the way:

In the first 45 seconds of the episode ""Echo"" (on disc 3)there was a good bit of scratches/spots from the original film stock. (most of which was pre-opening monologue and opening title) 45 seconds out of 9 hrs 21 min

That's it!

I noticed no missing frames, Jumps, splices, audio problems or the like anywhere in this set. The episodes were sharp and a joy to watch. I suspect this is from the best 35mm stock.

I have some public domain sets, and they were watchable, but this set blows them away! Stories like The Vision, Night of April 14th, The Dark Room, The Devil's Laughter, and The Return of Michael Campion really benefit from the remastering. There are also stories which I haven't seen in the PD issues.

The set is on three single-sided discs. The extras are somewhat minimal. The best being the extended ""The Bride Possessed"" which included a John Newland series promo that I'd never seen before. Also there is another promo, the Alcoa opening, the 1990's version titles, and a 4 min. 1991 audio interview with Don Mankiewicz (with read-along subtitles).

My 5 star rating takes into account the artistic merit as well as the video. I think these are fine stories well suited to these who enjoy Alfred Hitchcock Presents, The Twilight Zone or Thriller.

One Step Beyond fans should really enjoy this well-done set.

For those unfamiliar, One Step Beyond (which began in 1959) was an anthology series which told stories of strange or supernatural events that were based on supposedly true documented cases. Subject matter included hauntings, premonitions, curses, thought transference, miracles, re-incarnation and other bizarre phenomenon.",5.0,0

"From the beginning episode of season 1, I was hooked on this show.  It's a nuanced series of tightly plotted stories with a running series of subplots that slowly build from the beginnning.  The individual stories are not always what they seem - from the outset, the viewer knows that not all the people Reese and Finch try to help are victims - quite often, they are the perps that Reese has to stop before they commit whatever crime they have planned.

Of course, there are some clunkers but even the bad shows are superior to a lot of the dreck currently being aired on TV - broadcast or cable.

Before the show premiered, Jonathan Nolan, the series creator, called it Batman without the cape.  And, like all good hero/anti-hero franchises, this show has its own support 'family' as well as a marvelous rogues gallery with some enemies fixed seemingly permantently in the mythos and others appearing and eventually being handled.  Some, such as Elias, a mob boss out to control the NY rackets, start to slip into the show with mentions episodes before the character appears.

Many of these allies and rogues carry on into the new season which successfully opened with the resolution to the season 1 cliffhanger.  The flashbacks continue to reveal the backgrouds and motivations of Reese and Finch as well as the supporting cast - good guy or bad guy.  Fortunately, unlike producer JJ Abram's earlier success ""Lost"", this are much more defined & explain more - propelling the episode along.  (I love ""Lost"" but the flashbacks and flashforwards did get a bit confusing.)

I watched season 1 again then season 2 before season 3 premiered (several mini-marathons involved).  Each time I watch it, I see or hear something I missed before that enhances the show.  Some even have significance as the series goes on.

This is one of the very few Must-See shows for me.  And the only one on one of the big 4 networks.

Yes, Tammy Faye is a cartoon, a travesty of taste (on the dvd it is easy to focus on her fashion, we kept going back to some sort of hat that looked like she was a huge, religious, heavily made up insect....antennae and all.)  But like all good documentaries, it respects it's subject in a way that you come from it with much love and appreciation.  The dvd has no special stuff but the documentary alone has enough for cult viewers, pop culturists and voyeurs to obsess over for months.  There are puppets(religious puppets that they formed from porky pig heads), there is Jesus as Joy, lots of singing, Jerry Falwell(if you never hated him before, you will now) riding down a water slide, narration by a sedated RuPaul...but under all the incredible tack, Tammy Faye emerges as an amazingly passionate, forgiving non judgemental human being.  Her stand considering gay christians and christians with aids is almost revolutionary.  .......also there is a speech she gives at the end, when doing a sermon, which is inspired and forgiving.  It gives you a very different perspective on the permanantly made up miracle maven......This is a documentary that stays with you, respectful, kitschy(love the jim j and tammy faye show), informative and at times confrontative, this is a really fun watch.

"Bought this especially to support my puppy and she loves it.  She also loves the smell and the fact that it is a plastic bag.  The dog is tall so it is easy to put on and it is easy to clean.  I wish it was stronger so it would have been more durable.  I also like the fact that the plastic is not cheap and so you can use it to put on a leash or a harness for your dog.  It is very easy to wash and holds up well.  The only thing I wish I could give it a 4 is that it is a bit heavier than I expected.  It is not too heavy for my dog.  I had hoped for a lighter weight, but I don't think I got the right size for her.  It has a little bit of a pull-off with the top part of the bag, but she is very well-behaved.  I will say that it does not upset her as much as the small bag that she had.  She is a big chewer so it is not too heavy for her.  It is not heavy, it is just very soft and she is able to run without it being a struggle.  I am very pleased with this purchase.  I will be ordering more soon.

"This is SO lightweight--it's a pleasure to lift. A friend tried this litter and found her cats walked around the house with it stuck to their feet. While all litter sticks to feet, this is light enough to make the trek much farther from the litter box.

"This series is amazing! Even if it only has a handful of episodes, it's so well-plotted and most of the characters are amazingly acted. Heather was underutilized, but I won't get into that for brevity and sanity's sake. I think the best part of the show is that it has a rich cast of characters that bring all different perspectives of society into play. You have the mayor and family, the farmer, the orphaned teen, the school teacher, the government agent, the cops, etc. It's not just focused on one person, and each sect of characters has its own issues. This is especially true of the first season. It also deals with the nuclear fallout issues realistically. Did you know that acid rain would be a problem after a nuclear explosion happened miles away?
 I didn't, but the writers did. They made an effort to make things as realistic as possible. Maybe not perfect, but pretty darn close. Definitely worth purchasing and watching if you enjoy well acted and well-crafted stories. It ends slightly open ended, but it brings closure, so don't worry about that aspect of it.",5.0,0

"These motion night lights are the best.

I'm not the one that likes lights running at night, I like it dark to sleep and even a nightlight in the bathroom glowing is too much light for me.  I installed at first one of these in the bathroom and loved it so much I had to buy more packs so we could put one in the kitchen, on the basement stairs, laundry room, and additional bathroom.

The light turns on only when you need it, when your in the room.  The light is plenty bright to see what you are doing in the bathroom (not for reading though) but not too bright to wake you totally up at night.  It turns on and runs for about 45 seconds unless additional motion is detected.

I find myself leaving the lights off when I go into the basement as the motion nightlight is plenty bright enough for me to sagely climb the stairs or walk in the basement without fear of tripping over the pet.

I had some relatives over and one of them commented on the nightlight so much that I ended up giving her one for her own home.  She afterwards commented how much she loved having it.  Simple devices make life so much easier...

PROS:
- Low Voltage LED
- Uses very little power
- Will illuminate a 10x8 bathroom no problem (not a reading brightness though)
- Only on when you want it on
- Bright enough to see what you are doing without waking you up too badly at night
- You'd better buy the multi-pack or you'll be buying again
- Runs for about 45 seconds unless more motion detected
- Have been using now for about 2 years without a failure

CONS:
- Wish I had found these a long time ago (I hated the 7watt nightlights)
- Cat runs by it to see in her litter box (I though they could see well in the dark)",5.0,0
"As a fan of the work of George Clooney, Ryan Gosling, and Philip Seymour Hoffman, I expected to love this movie.  After watching it, I thought it was just ""OK"".  I was left wanting more passion in the overall film that I just wasn't feeling.

UPDATE 4/6/15:
Since this review I have collected several dozen more SAK's. I just love them. I have decided that I prefer the Climber models over the Super Tinker for the following reasons:

-The Super Tinker's Phillips driver is in an awkward location (in the middle of the knife rather than the end).
-The Phillips on the Super Tinker is redundant because the Can Opener suffices quite well as a Phillips driver.
-Replacing the Super Tinker's Phillips driver with the Corkscrew and concealed Mini Driver adds two extra tools to the same compact design.

Regardless, I still do love the Super Tinker. But I feel there's a little more functionality in the Climber.",5.0,0

"(1.) Anne is attractive and the film is so dependent on it that she and the camera exploit it with constant close ups of her face and her charming/beguiling but theatrically pointless expressions (over 50% of the film actually).
(2.) Plot is a rip off of other crash movies where we are led to believe they're alive but they're not.
(3.) Dialogue is very poorly scripted with cliched non-professional exchanges between roles such as Wilson as the ex-corporate V.P. turns wall painter, motorcycle rider, sailboat sailor, midnight swimmer, rooftop wall sitter (fortunately less than a minute for each activity) with the totally unrealistic and incompetent questioning by Anne the psychiatrist.
(4.) Little effort by the studio to spend money. No realistic special effects and no effort to research plane crashes. The plane's remnants should have been clearly marked and placed in a secure hanger. To save composer and musicians fees the music was a constant and monotonous plunking of a few piano keys. Saved money by not having a director as evidenced by the lack of continuity and building tension appropriate for this type of movie. Well, someone added a gratuitously brief semi-sex scene.
(5.) But the worst crime that the studio commits is to exploit people's fear of flying and death with the feelgood ""you're not really dead just vacationing your dreams forever"".",1.0,0

"MagicMil has created a phenomenal night light product. I was so excited when I found out I had the chance to review this product. Even more so when I received it in the mail.

Although I do not have a baby currently in my household, I do have a toddler and I have put this to good use with her. She can get hot at night and end up sweating terribly. This sits on the dresser in our room beings we still co-sleep. Hey, don't judge! Not only does she benefit from this but it instantly tells me the temperature in the mornings so I know what to wear. Same goes with my oldest daughter.

I love the color association part of it. It's not like your normal night light where it's just a light and shows you nothing. It's also not bothersome to sleep. It glows just enough that you can tell it's there but it's not bright in any way.

It's convenient in the sense that you can charge it and it lasts for 72 hours before needing to be charged again. It's portable once it's charged which is a plus. Just keep a power bank with you on long trips and voila!

I am in the early stages of teaching my toddler the association between hot and cold. This night light is something that I know will help her along with learning what cold is and what hot is. She already loves looking at it and holding it.

I also really look forward to using this for a baby that may come along in the future. As a mom of 2, I have confidence in this night light for so many reasons. Definitely worth purchasing for yourself, a new mom, as a baby shower gift, housewarming gift or even Christmas gift.

"Pros: pretty easy to install, delivers a nice stream of water, good spray pressure, feels sturdy after install, can do the handle left or right, color I wanted. Cons: almost returned because its super tall and clunky looking (not rustic, but not refined), the pull down nozzle does not pull out or retract very smoothly, the pull down nozzle does not set back in place without being very deliberate. I did way too much research and found that most pull down faucets have issues, so I had lowered expectations. I thought I might regret switching from a decent regular kitchen faucet to an arch with a pull down - but it is a very good change. Thought the soap dispenser might be a disappointment - but its been great and super easy to refill. There aren't too many black faucets available currently - I really like black or oil rubbed brass, but oil rubbed bronze is popular right now, which I don't like.

"I had high expectations of this miniseries, given it's creation under the auspices and consultancy of Mr. King himself.  It turned out to be a drawn out melodrama, full of gimmickry and with very little of the artistic panache of the original movie.  The hotel itself was attractive enough, but from there on, it went downhill.  Neither the malevolent, carnivorous topiaries in the garden, nor the two lame ghost plot participants did much to create a haunted atmosphere in the hotel.  The hotel's creaks and groans and auto-swinging doors were trite and none of the characters were truly convincing.  Rebecca de Mornay as Wendy is alright, Jack Torrance, played here by Steven Weber is an annoying exercise in waffling, being an aggressive boozer one minute, and a pathetic whimperer the next.  He never seems to be able to make up his mind who he is or what he wants,  an irritatingly disjointed character who himself seems to have no idea where he is going.  Consequently, the whole thing is ultimately a three hour bore. While the original movie may have had it's shortcomings in its abrupt structure of the progression of the story, it was nevertheless far more convincing than this mushy rendition which seemed to be nothing more than the product of the mercantile minds at Warner Brothers, doing their level best to wrest additional revenue from a classic story.",2.0,0

Upon contacting the manufacturer, they offered to send replacements over and over again, but no one would address the real problem:  Isn't something wrong with the product if you can't even ship it without it being destroyed?

For those stuck with these lamps, here is one DIY solution:  When the lamp is cold, very gently open the bottle cap on top with a tiny flat-head screw driver.  Loosen the teeth of the cap all the way around just enough to get the cap off.  Do not use a bottle opener, because it will bend the cap in the middle and you'll never get it to seal tightly again.

"These are also sold with a standard 3/4"" thick metal holder that is a little larger than a standard bulb. The plastic holder is also designed to be easily removed from the fixture.

The light is not bright enough to illuminate a room. This is a problem for most people. They need to have a portable light that can be mounted anywhere on the fixture.

"I purchased a different kit than the one listed.  Mine had the Quick-Change adapter with 7 hex shank high-speed drill bits.  The drill bits are of excellent quality as is the click adapter.  All you have to do to insert a bit is push it in.  To remove it simply pull back on the padded collar of the adapter and the bit pops out.  Unlike Sears, Dewalt, Snapy and other quick adapters that I have used you do not have to pull back on the adapter and pull the bit out at the same time. The Bosch just pops it out.  What impressed me the most however was the lack of run out that the Bosh has.  The wobble that is present at the driver bit or drill bit tip that anyone who has ever used any sort of quick change hex shank adapter is much less noticeable with the Bosch than any I have ever used.  I am a solid surface/laminate fabricator and much of my time is spent installing counter tops and kitchen cabinets where a drill is indispensable for drilling as well as driving.  I have 3 of the Bosch Quick-Change adapters one in a Makita, one in a Dewalt, and one in a Metabo cordless drill.  I would not be without one of these Bosch adapters on the work site.  By the way I also use a Dewalt 7.2v screwdriver which is a pleasure to use and comes with a hex shank quick adapter mounted to the drill shaft instead of a chuck and it has more run-out than these Bosch adapters.",5.0,0

"I have had this saw for a number of years. I am primarily a carpenter but dabble in a lot of crafts for the sake of expediency and simply out of acquiring a skill in a variety of types of work.  If I had it to do over again I would not buy a bridge-type saw. The concept seems good but in reality, the design just doesn't provide the kind of sawing control needed to cut tile accurately.  The blade cannot be moved smoothly across tile the way it can on saws where the blade remains fixed and the bed holding the material moves INTO the blade.

The slated fixed aluminum base also creates a rather slippery platform for wet tile. Some type of backstop to prevent the material from shifting is needed and the inferior design and cheaply built T-square provided just isn't adequate.  It simply does not provide adequate control of the cutting process.

You would think that the extended length of the box like construction would provide ample space for long cuts on larger tiles but the bridge arms are inevitably in the way of most cutsforget doing diagonal cuts on larger tiles.

Besides an inferior design, the unit is cheaply made with poor welds and rough finishes that do not hold up well. The water reservoir and pump produces a sloppy mess that can be generally be avoided with other style saws.  The motor is also a bit underpowered but nonetheless has continued to run with regular use.

Don't let the quirky design lure you in. Look to more basic type tile saws.",2.0,0

This was an excellent movie from start to finish. The story and the dialogue were constantly engaging. Some of the language is not widely used today but was perfect for the time and the actors were good at conveying the meaning through their expressions and tone. At the beginning of the film the main character is not very likeable and seemed to be strickly worried about society and her place in it but as the film goes on we find that she is trusting because she is trustworthy to her friends and true love. When she can clear her name she sacrifices for her true love. Even though this is a period film I found myself sympathetic to Lily's situation. Wonderful performances by all. The costumes and makeup were so good I did not recognize several actors at first. I did not care for the ending but it fit the story and any other ending would have felt contrived.

When cutting. push the Saw all the way down on the FOOT and apply adequate pressure to keep it there as sawing. do not FORCE the SAW too hard to make the cut. Watch out for BLADE BINDING by the Material you are cutting starts pinching the blade. you can burn the Motors out by too much MUSCLE forcing it down thru the cut. or binding the blade!.

"Sandra Bullock plays Lucy, an activist lawyer following in her parents footsteps, who ends up being roped into a gig working for a real estate conglomerate headed up by the brothers Wade. George, (played by the nebbishy good Hugh Grant) the promiscuous manchild younger brother who always falls for his assistants, wants an assistant/ lawyer whom he won't be attracted to and Lucy ends up fitting the bill. Lucy isn't terribly likable; shes uptight, slightly histrionic, and seemingly going nowhere in her career. She and George get along about as well as nails and a chalkboard and George, who is likable because hes such a charming non-threatening putz, relies on Lucy for every little detail revealing a self-doubting self-deprecating man that begins to change as hes challenged by Lucys strengths and conscience. The two become unlikely friends at some point, and then they realize that they really care about each other. George the playboy cant really deal with his feelings in straightforward fashion and so hurts Lucy who determines to give her two weeks notice (oho! theres the title). In the end George grows some and stands up to his older brother and parents, but is he too late to regain the woman he loves? Its a likable love story set in NYC and the narrative sticks tight to Bullock and Grant. They end up having some real chemistry.",4.0,0

I could buy the storyline had another director taken on the task of making this film and developing the script to make it realistic. In contrast, it was like watching a train wreck...the dialogue was elementary and made the acting subpar and laughable. The story felt amateur and therefore comedic rather than scary.

"This disk is one of my favorites. Although not quite up to the standards of it's two predecessors, the Third Dr. Mabuse film (and the last directed by Lang himself) is wonderful and more than worth the purchase price.
David Kalat's extraordinary commentary is easily THE BEST I have ever heard (and I've heard quite a few.) He strikes the perfect balance between knowledge and wit - the narration is informative without being dry or condescending and, indeed, is quite lively at times. His delivery style is remarkably excellent throughout and is a major reason I consider the disk to be one of my most valued.
Two tiny quibbles, stuff so small as to bother only me: The English Language captioning, written for the German audio track, is a little disorienting when viewed in connection with the English language track. Most of this has to do with the demands of lip-synchronization between two languages. Still, and despite the additional cost it might have created, two independent sets of captions would have been appreciated - one for each of the different languages. This would be a welcome addition for a hearing impared viewer.
The other minor quibble is that the documentary really needed captioning, much more so than the feature owing to the heavy accented speech.
All told, though, this is absolutely a remarkable film and a remarkable, and very treasured disk. AllDay Entertainment is releasing some extraordinary stuff, and deserve kudos and, above all, purchases!",4.0,0

"The finale was decent- alot of zombies- and they finally got off the farm. If they spend next season only at the prison it will get drawn-out though.

Now they will bring Michionne in, but seriously wt heck is she doing out in the woods with hundreds of zombies around? And old man Herschel with that 100 round pump shotgun was too funny. Rick needs to get serious and give Carl a good ol' fashioned butt-whooping for all the mess he's caused and Lori is a bipolar biatch who needs to be served-up as zombie chow. T-dog -what the heck good is he? He's always wanting to go off on his own, and never does squat. Just kill him-off already. Carol, seriously-- Sophia was more useful. And now that we know everyone's infected already, who cares if you turn into a zombie upon dying and not by being bitten/scratched. Maybe they will introduce a new twist here.

"This is the only sequel to place the central figure, Prof. Horatio Smith(Leslie Howard), (Scarlet Pimpernel re-incarnate) a century and then some years in the future. Yet, knowing this, this meticulously restored yarn stands entirely alone in thought-provoking suspense, cat-and-mouse deception and thought. Cambridge Prof. Smith is traveling through Germany in wartime with a handful of students while a mysterious man rescues endangered scientists, intellectuals. Are they connected and how? The way Leslie Howard embodies this earlier Indiana Jones archaeologist so completely with all the thrills of his original Scarlet Pimpernel (disguises/surprises) yet takes on fully the seriousness of the Nazi threat to humanity with witty and thought-provoking dialogue places this above most WWII yarns. Added to the Gestapo pressures is an added tension of a cagey female (Mary Morris) pursuer seeking the identity of this war-time savior. The polished script by Leslie Howard is fantastically photographed making this a compelling lustrous addition to the WWII spy genre. A final monologue directed to the Gestapo is as valid today as it was in the 40s.",5.0,0

"What can I say about this film that hasn't already been said?

I wasn't particularly interested in ""Office Space"" when it first came out, and I assume that it was a sleeper hit upon theatrical release, but when I checked it out much later, I was on the floor laughing. Not only does ""Office Space"" stand out as a great comedy for those starved of great comedy, but manages to hit closer with those actually victimized by white-collar occupations. It's suprising how this evolved from a series of cheaply-made animated shorts, starring the squirrely stapler-obsessed Milton, and into an underestimated masterpiece.

Some would say that a comedy doesn't really require top-notch acting to get its hilarity across, but ""Office Space"" is a grand exception. Ron Livingston is perfect in the role of Peter, who learns that by doing nothing you can find the ultimate happiness and confidence you seek (thanks to unreversed hypnosis). Gary Cole's portrayal of the boring yet frightening Lumbergh should be added to the pantheon of best screen villains ever, and Stephen Root was simply born to play Milton.

Mike Judge obviously felt compelled to split open the unexplored injustice of white-collar slavery and definitely makes it work. This isn't a gross-out comedy full of outrageous behavior (I don't know if the bludgeoning of the copy machine counts), but if you want to unwind after a tough day of school or work and enjoy a downright funny-as-hell movie, you're making the right decision to owe this one a few bucks.",5.0,0

"I have the standard Litter Genie, and I think it's the greatest! I don't understand the negative reviews--in one, it almost sounds like the person was trying to empty their whole litter box into the Genie. Cleaning the litter box will never be a pleasant experience (until my cat starts pooping gold nuggets!), but Litter Genie makes the process neat and easy. I simply use the provided scoop, pick the box clean, and ""flush"" the collection down into the collection bag. No problems and no odor! I am very sensitive to litter box odor, and there has been none since I got my Litter Genie.
Replacing the bags is a breeze, too. Inside the compartment is a cutter--simply pull the bag down from the refill so there is enough to tie a knot in the top of the filled bag. Remove the filled bag. Then, make your new bag by simply tying a firm knot in the cut end of the plastic, forming the bottom of your new bag. Pull down enough material to fill the compartment, close the container, and you're done.

I have one, and occasionally two, cats inside and two litter boxes. Even with two cats, one bag will last me 2-3 weeks. I use natural corncob litter, which is easy to scoop. Very little unused litter gets into my Litter Genie. I don't find it necessary to use a hack for the replacement bags. The refills are reasonably priced since I don't have to change the bag every day (like some reviewers said they were doing). It's easy to carry the Litter Genie between litter boxes because there is a convenient carrying opening on the back, near the top. I have never had trouble with it coming apart while I was carrying it.

I like my Genie so much that I'm going to buy another one, just because I'm lazy and don't want to tote the one I have to the second litter box! I am very, very pleased with my purchase.",5.0,0

"Light looks okay, a bit heavy for a AA size. Uses the switch to alternate between low and high. Low is too dim to be useful and the high is a WIDE Flood, not as bright as advertised.  My Fenix E21 is better on low and high is brighter at 150 lumens!  I'll stay with a Fenix E21 for an EDC light, or the Streamlight JR LED at 85 lumens.

UPDATE: April 2013, Getting ready to throw out the light, just thought I'd try something new. My new EDC lights are FENIX E11, one AA battery, 115 lumen high and 38 lumen low. Until reading some reviews, I'd have never known about 14500 batteries (AA size, just 3.7 volt, not 1.2 volt of normal AA battery.) For nearly 5 months I have been using 14500 battery in the E11, WOW! Nearly triples the light output, low is 200+ lumens, high near 300... Also, in reading, DO NOT USE TWO IN A 2 AA LIGHT!

But, there are some light manufacturers recommending a single 14500 and a dummy cell in a 2 AA light (All this depends on the LED quality, do the homework! I DID..)

In the Lightstar 300, output was only 140-150 lumens on the AA's. I've added one 14500 to one AA and VIOLA! A real tactical light!! Just over 300 lumens on high and 45-50 on low.  This is without testing equip., just comparison to other lights that are accurately measured by the makers.

Two points: 1. The warranty is voided.  and 2. Accidents may occur, use at your own risk.

Read the manfacturers LED parameters, the operating voltage is a good measure of possible use. I now have a Lightstar 300 that acts like a 300, no telling what the runtime is.  Still a one star light on AA batteries.",1.0,0

"Hapless, accident-prone Keitaro becomes janitor of a dorm populated by a quintet of stunningly beautiful, but dangerously abusive women -- one of which may turn out to be his secret sweetheart who he apparently promised would attend Tokyo U fifteen years ago. The only thing this series succeeds in is putting a whole new meaning in the phrase ""love hurts."" Most of it involves Keitaro getting into embarrassing incidents with these women and getting the crap kicked out him. This happens in just about EVERY SINGLE FREAKIN' EPISODE. It gets old in no time and is just discouraging to me as a viewer. Worse still, there's nary a sympathetic character, much less one the audience REALLY cares about. I practically detested the female characters, especially Keitaro's intended sweetheart, the nasty, overly violent Naru, who comes across as one of the most intolerable, bitchiest, bad-tempered heroines ever committed to Anime. (Yes, she's as bad as the title character from NADIA: THE SECRET OF BLUE WATER in the infamous island/Africa arc and Asuka in EVANGELION.) There are occasional bits of cleverness (like a parody of the popular JRPG DRAGON QUEST), but LOVE HINA's overall nature is too mean-spirited for its own entertainment value. Even if the idea was to make this a comedy, it still falls flat. You'd have to be a masochist in order to sit through this joyless show. Matters are not helped by the dubbing, with performances that range from shrill to just plain awful, a disappointing misfire from the usually capable Bang Zoom studios. All in all, I absolutely detested LOVE HINA and I cannot recommend it. There are far better Anime shows to invest in.",1.0,0

Use 1 pack of Knox Gelatin and 2 cups of water and 2 rounded cups of Bird Seed. Prepare Gelatin per directions.  You can use 2 packs if you want the seed cake more firm.  They might even last longer, but I can't imagine the birds like it.  This makes 2 mini bundt ""Bird-Day Cakes"".

Mix together and pour/pack into mini bundt cake molds that have been sprayed with your favorite non-stick spray. (Gotta have the hole in the center for this feeder.) Place in refrigerator until set.

We use Shell-less seeds for this.  They are expensive and you can certainly use regular bird seed or whatever your favorite bird loves.  We only use 1 cake at a time and haven't stacked them yet. The birds finish this off in 2-3 days.

Although this feeder has a small roof, continuous rain will melt away the cakes in a few days so better to make your own ""Bird-Day Cakes"" as a rainy day project and save some money.",4.0,0

"Due to the quirks of the marketplace, this was available at a much lower price than the 6"" and 8"" wrenches in the same series. The one I received was remarkable in that the jaws were very, very close to parallel.  Most wrenches of this type, whether foreign or domestic, tend to have jaws that are closer together at the opening tip than deep towards the throat, thus requiring the user to lift up the wrench axially after each turn for repositioning, rather than pulling the wrench radially away from the nut.  If there is no room for this, then the jaws need to be loosened to remove the wrench, and retightened in the new position.  Parallel jaws, or jaws that are wider at the mouth than throat, saves the extra steps.  The post that holds the worm gear adjuster was only lightly staked, and unscrews to allow maintenance.  Due to manufacturing tolerances, however, there is no assurance that yours won't be impossible to unscrew, or that the jaws will be parallel.",4.0,0

I checked to make sure it was level, there were no holes, and it wasn't over full.  Well it filled up right to the brim, but it was leaking from the flimsy reserve add on tank. I ended up removing it but it was still leaking a little.

"Wesley Snipes plays an undercover CIA agent in Romania. Pitted against this perpetually angry hero (whose emotions are delivered with bland voice-over) is a sexy and strong-willed Russian beauty played by Silvia Colloca. Snipes must protect Colloca going back to USA from the attacks of the villains of this country, whose motives I'm still trying to figure out.

There is no denying that this is a low-budget action film made in Romania, kind of film you watch for shoot-outs and explosions. To their credits, the stunt persons of the film did a decent job and in one memorable scene a baddie falls out of the window (of the second floor of a house) and falls onto the roof of a van below, hitting his head against it really hard and bouncing like a rubber ball. That is amazing. And don't forget the cat-and-mouse chase scene in the subway where a bald-headed baddie shows one surprising stunt.

But the rest of the film is very dull. ""The Detonator"" uses every clichd element of action genre taken directly from other better films, and throws them into the convoluted narrative in the wrong way. The film attempts to be different with a portrait of a gangster who owns a soccer team and several scenes about soccer games. However, it just doesn't work because of the tepid descriptions of games and banal action sequences mixed with them.

It was in 2004 when we saw the third entry of `The Blade' which was not bad. But now Wesley Snipes seems to have officially joined in the direct-to-video land where Steven Seagal is the king or the Great One. (In fact `The Detonator' is co-produced by Andrew Stevens who is also responsible for such films as ""Half Past Dead"" ""The Foreigner"" and ""Out of Reach."") I'm not saying that all straight-to-video actions are bad - remember Dolph Lundgren who is doing a very good job as star and director. - but as to `The Detonator"" the result is simply disappointing.",1.0,0

"Only a portion of this film is devoted to the actual rendition of the Water Music, and only a bit of the portion at that. The greater part is focused on the preparations for producing this would-be recreation of the original performance, intended to enhance George I's public relations battle with his son, the eventual successor as George II. The English Concert under Andrew Manze is recruited for the original instrument performance, and they are decked out in period costume -- with the women orchestra members in effect posing as men and the men who have facial hair sacrificing that to the barber's blade for the sake of authenticity. Acoustical tests are performed on the river to gauge how everything will sound outside the concert hall, and a suitable barge reminiscent of those of three hundred years ago must be found to refurbish. In the end, everything comes off, more or less. To call it a full recreation is a bit of an exaggeration, however. The barge must be towed by a modern tug, rather than propelling itself by means of oarsmen. Moreover, the musical barge is more or less on its own, unlike the original performance, where many personal barges accompanied the king to Chelsea for his meal and then back, serenaded all the while. Indeed, as the barge proceeds along the Thames and into the night, few people on shore appear to really notice what's going on. The performances that are heard are certainly fine enough, and the sight of the musicians playing in early 18th Century garb is fun, but in the end I thought the documentary fell just a little flat.

"It's been a while since we've had a movie where a child played the bad guy, or in this case, the bad girl. This movie really exceeded my expectations as I was expecting another predictable and corny horror flick. ""Orphan"" is billed as a horror movie, but in actuality it is a psychological thriller. Any way you slice it (no pun intended), this turned out to be a very good movie.

The first thing that comes to mind while watching this movie is ""The Good Son"" (1993), but ""Orphan"" has a better plot, more twists & turns, a more deranged child, and more surprises than you'd expect. Actually, Esther (the Orphan) is so evil and mentally disturbed that she makes ""The Good Son"" seem like a choir boy. Like other movies with this theme, the mother becomes suspicious early-on that something isn't quite right about the child, while the father plays the head-in-the-sand do-do who just doesn't get it until it's too late.

This flick is not about the supernatural or demons and such; it's just about one conniving, creepy, crazy a** kid who was adopted from an orphanage and who terrorized the hell out of a somewhat ordinary family struggling to overcome some tragic life events. This is one of those movies that you can't say too much about without giving away the entire plot, but I can say that ""Orphan"" is quite entertaining and is definitely worth seeing. It has great acting, a good plot, a great lead character, a little humor, numerous twists & turns, good suspense and a surprise ending. In fact, I'm anticipating a possible ""Orphan II"".",4.0,0

"We have 4 cats. They all seem to love this litter. They go in, dig around awhile, do their duty and then they spend a more than usual time scratching around in the litter box before they exit. We, at first, though that it was because they were having a difficult time covering up their duty with the light litter. We were wrong. We have two litter boxes downstairs (and two upstairs) sitting side-by-side so we performed an experiment on the two downstairs litters. We put light litter in the left hand box and clay litter in the right. In the morning we filled one litter with their usual clay based litter and one with this light litter. The cats used them all day. At the end of the first day the box with the light litter was used about 30% more than the clay. On the second day the light litter box was use almost exclusively. There were only a couple of pee clumps in the clay litter. On the third day we reversed the positions of the two litter boxes. Now they were clay left and light right. Only the right box (light litter) was used all day. The clay litter box was clean! Both upstairs clay litter boxes were pretty much unused except for some pee. I have since seen the cats standing in line waiting to use the light litter box while the clay litter box was being left unused and completely vacant. Darndest thing I've ever seen. Now we're putting clay in the bottom and light on top until the clay is gone. From then on, light litter ONLY. Oh yeah, the light  litter does not track-out on the cat's paws and then onto the floor nearly as much as the clay litter. This makes my wife very happy.",5.0,0

"Be aware that there are only three Melies shorts on this disk and only one of them is in color. A Trip to the Moon is on the disk twice, once in color and again in B&W. There is a choice of two excellent  musical tracks on the B&W films, but the color film only has one soundtrack. It is completely unidiomatic, has distracting mumbling voices, and it doesn't follow the action of the film. Worse yet, it omits Melies's own narration that is supposed to be part of the film.  Nothing makes sense without it. The cheezy synth music sounds like the loopy soundtrack to a 1970s mutton chop midget porn movie. The film is best watched with the volume turned down. The rest of the disk is filled out with a feature length documentary which is interesting, but I can't imagine watching it more than once.

For a little more money you can get a five disk Flicker Alley DVD collection of Melies with dozens of great films, many of which are in even more beautiful color than this one. I'd recommend getting that instead. Search ""melies flicker alley"" and you'll find it. There is a supplement DVD that completes the set too.

"I needed a new headlamp to replace one from a big box store which broke easily.  I chose this one because it has a separate switch for the red light.  I am an amateur astronomer, and I use a red light when I am observing to protect my night vision when reading star maps and eyepiece focal lengths.  It takes about 30 mins for your eyes to become dark-adapted, and thus able to see very faint deep sky objects.  A flash of white light ruins night vision for another 20-30 mins, and my previous headlamp had to cycle through 3 white light settings just to get to red, and this was a nuisance to me and anyone who was observing with me.  THIS headlamp allows me to switch on the red light without any possibility of turning on the white light, and I liked it so much that I purchased a second one for my wife.
Enough about red light, now I'll tell you what I like about the white light.  I had to do some work in the attic, and I used this headlamp to see what I was doing in the dark attic.  It starts of with the brightest white light setting at first one when you press the white light switch.  If you quickly press the switch again it goes to a dimmer setting for longer battery life if you're going to have it on for an extended period.  There are 3 brightness levels which can be accessed by pressing the switch again within about 5 seconds.  I am very pleased to tell you that you don't have to cycle through all these brightness levels to turn it off, because after being on in any brightness mode for more than 5 seconds results in it simply switching off with ONE press of the switch.  All this and a LIFETIME WARRANTY for an incredibly low price.  Stop looking now and buy this one -- you won't be disappointed.",5.0,0

"When a sump pump goes bellyup it usually happens when you need it most. Which means you can't wait for shipping or shop price, you head to the hardware store and pay top buck. After numerous Wayne pump float switches died (usually just after the warranty expires)I saw this one with the Switch Genius technology. At 3/4 HP it was more pump than I needed and it was the most expensive sump pump I ever bought. But I figured if the switch was more reliable than float switches the piece of mind would be worth the money.

I noticed the switch cycles the pump on early and shuts off only after sucking air for 10 - 15 seconds. After some severe storms a few weeks later I came home from work and could smell something hot. The pump wasn't turning off and was hotter than blazes! After following the manual and cleaning off the sensor it still wouldn't shut off. After unplugging the pump for half an hour or so it appeared to work normally again. Every time there's a storm I have trouble with the water sensor not shutting off the pump. Wayne says to send it back for a replacement on my dime. It weighs a ton and is going to be expensive to ship. Plus, what do I do for a pump while there's two in transit?

I had a Zoeller pump for over ten years with no problems until the switch died.

"Having just watched McFarland USA with Costner which I think was a good movie, it was tough for me not to compare the two movies and Costners portrayals a bit. Costners plays his flawed character well although his portrayal feels a bit more subdued than I expected. To me though Estill, who played the little girl Eloise, really played her role well. This is a movie that tries to tell a story that is a shade of gray and not clear cut with everyone involved having some character flaws of their own. There are some emotional moments but at times the movie feels a bit flat and slow moving and the story failed to really connect me to the characters and pull me at the heartstrings that I expected it to do so. It almost seemed to me that they tried too hard to be a bit grey in their story at times with the lack of character development that made it feel a bit superficial. Maybe it was because I watched McFarland USA and I am comparing this too much, I don't know.

"I bought one of these units in 2008 when I saw one on the news.  I checked my area on the Internet and saw I lived in a red zone for radon.  When I received it and let it settle in for 2 days, the level was 6.0.  The EPA said 4. O is the highest safe level for radon.  I called to have a radon removal system installed.  Very quickly the level dropped to 1.9 and the company guaranteed their system would keep it that low.  Now for the problem.  It did stay a 1.9 for about 3 years but then a power outage came and the unit then, after being reset, read 2.0.  Later, another power outage came and the unit read 2.1.  Lastly, after another outage, it read 2.2.  Finally, a long outage came and the unit never recovered and all it would show was two dashes.  I think it got fried little by little.  But all in all, I'm ready to buy another one but I will plug it into a surge protector this time.  At one point in time during the higher readings, I did call the company and the person I spoke to did tell me that the unit did not--NOT-- need to be re-calibrated.  That is why I think it got fried from a power surge. So, you might want to invest in a good surge protector for this product if you have one or buy one.

Update:  The day after I wrote the above.  Husband reset the unit's memory and let it ""smell"" the air for over 48 hrs.  Now the reading is .08 and it seems to be working just fine.  I think maybe (what do I know?) the power surges did do something to it for it to keep jumping up like it did but now, with a reset memory, it is working great.  Keep the instructions that come with it in case you have to reset your unit someday.",4.0,0

"'Say Die Strom (is that what it is?).  The film is a turn-off for the young (and the old) people, and the social class.  It is very much like a family movie, with a good script, good acting, and a good story.

""Die Strom"" is a great family movie, and I hope it continues to be like this.  I would recommend it to anyone who loves family.  I have a hard time finding anything that could have been better.

If you like family, you will love this movie!  It is a movie that is well-made, well-acted, and well-written.  The only thing that is missing is a good dose of humor.  This movie is not for everyone, and it should be avoided at all costs.

A good review is provided in the DVD section.  You can view the entire movie in its entirety.

To conclude, this is a great family movie.  The acting, the story, and the direction are excellent.  The movie is a must-see, and it will be enjoyed by any family.  I recommend it to anyone who loves family.  I don't care for the negative reviews.  I love family movies!I love this series, the costumes, the music, and the story.  This is an excellent collection.

"Seraphim Falls, boldly shot in the heart, with the voice of a man who is the leader of the self-proclaimed ""Godfather of the Tomb."" The film is a great tribute to the man and his art.

The film was shot in 24 hours, and the camera angles were spectacular. The film was shot in the park, and the locations were filmed in the mountainous terrain. The main subject matter was not the film itself, but the impact of a well-known story on the lives of the men who made it.

The film is presented as a beautiful film, and it shows that the people who made it were courageous and brave. The film shows the people who made it as well as the people who gave it their all to make it a reality. It is a great film to watch, and it is a story that is about a man and his art.

"My dog has had skin bacteria issue on and off for a while because of his age and immunity.  I read the reviews on this item and had tried the Zymox brand for his ear yeast infections and this stuff performed pretty miraculously.

The shampoo is amazingly rich and thick.  It smells good and does a much better job than following up my dog's bath with a vinegar rinse which is what I was doing before to get rid of the skin issues.  However, my sensitive dog hated, really hated the vinegar rinse and it would stress him out so much that I had to find another solution.  I tried this and he was pleasantly surprised as was I.  This gets to the deep areas beneath the coat easily and doesn't just sit on the surface of the skin.  I followed the instructions about letting it sit for 3-5 minutes and I let it set for five and more.  The shampoo is easy to rinse out and really leaves his skin feeling soft.  After his bath, he does not show the normal irritation of moving from one position in the house to the next.  He seems more settled and not trying to escape the itch.  After his bath, I inspected the areas and they were almost as pink as the rest of his normal skin.

But don't be fooled!  Bacteria and fungus invasions are nothing to play around with.  I am giving him a bath every other day for three weeks and washing his bedding every single day and it is making a difference.  This shampoo is great and I have purchased the Zymox coat conditioner for after bath rinsing.  I will post more later as progress goes...",5.0,0
"So this is my fur baby's favorite toy!  I will keep this for the next couple of months.My dogs love this food.  My dog eats it in a day and he seems to like it.  I think it will be better for him to eat it in the evening and then sleep in it.  I also think the ingredients are good.  It has a good amount of protein, grain and veggies.  The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because I don't know how the ingredients are, but I'm not sure how the ingredients are listed.  My dog is a medium breed dog and it's kind of hard to tell what ingredients are in the ingredients list.  I don't know if it's the food itself or the ingredients list.  I wish the ingredients list was more informative, but I don't know.My cats love this!  It's perfect size for a small dog.  I use it to transport a large bag of cat food from the house.

"I just received this item today. At first glance, it looks attractive enough. Upon closer inspection, it is a poorly made item. The manufacturers should have put more thought in quality rather than adding two decorative silver bones which adds no function to this item. The stitching is unraveling at the ""leash area."" The ""tag"" stitching also has unraveled. If I were the cynical type, I would say that the supplier knew of the unraveled stitching and tried to glue it back together but it didn't hold. Also the hidden tag is paper under a plastic sleeve. I would never trust my beloved dog to only have this as a tag. It is not waterproof nor is it secure in it's sleeve; The tag is useless. The ""D"" is too bulky, and as others have mention, the extra collar end just hangs there, making the collar look unfinished and shabby. The built-in leash is a great idea, but this item falls short in quality. The leash is made of some stretching rubber (kind of like a car fan belt but not as strong). I predict that this leash will break if used too often, so I am not going to rely on it in public. I'll just use it in the house. I normally would return a product like this but it probably would cost me more in time and money to ship it back, which is probably what the supplier counts on.

I was very skeptical about whether the product would actually work.  The science is hard to prove!

I installed one of these items on my incoming water supply.  I thought I would start there and then move it to just the hot water side if I wasn't getting the results I wanted.  Since I installed this about 6 months ago, I have never had to clean any calcium from my dishwasher wands.  Yes, I changed out my dishwasher when I installed the Eddy but I really believe I have seen a difference.  I had decided I would spend my budget on the Eddy rather than a top of the line dishwasher since they all seem to clog with the hard water in my area (200 mg/L as CaCO3 or 12 grains).

"A LED light in the $5 to $7 range that works as well as this one has to be worth some kind of gold star. I replaced an 6 volt Xenon Lantern with one of these only it works better - much.
I 100% totally don't understand the people spending huge amounts of time finding fault with a device like this and my reaction is - get a life. These things are flashlights or devices that I - a retired electronics engineer don't see how they can build at this price point much less how good and solid they really are and how well they actually work.
Under no circumstances would I mount one on a Picatinny Rail Mount (even if it fit), or other life/death applications but - me I just need a flashlight. A good one that can save me from replacing expensive lantern batteries which this thing does superbly.

"This season is hard to stomach.  The problem: There is far too much hand wringing over ""torture"" and and other liberal causes (saving africans from genocide, profiling of muslims, Gitmo, evil right wing terrorists) it is difficult to watch. It is such an odd take on 24, which has always been about doing what it takes to beat the bad guys and preserving freedom and the American way. You wonder what the writers were thinking (Presumably, we really hate George Bush). There is also an amazing (and not very beleivable) resurrection of a previously dead 24 character, a feat only Jack Bauer could accomplish up until this season. Lots of eye rolling ensues.  24 has always had liberal elements. (All good presidents are black and/or women, all bad corrupt presidents are white men.) But this season really takes it over top. The last straw was near the end of the season ultra left winger Janeane Garafolo, playing an FBI analysts (the evil CTU has been disbanded, presumably for torturing too many people), whines incesantly about how the FBI was ""trampling the constitution""  by ""profiling"" and jack apologizes to her! I nearly barfed. Add then the peaceful innocent muslims who are framed as terrorists by the evil right wingers and well, you get the picture.  They just beat you over the head week after week with every liberal cause you can imagine. And let's not forget the  slow weepy finale that fades to black before resolving many key plot elements. Does Jack die from being exposed to a fatal biological weapon?, Who knows? Does Renee turn into Jack Bauer and kill the villain? Your guess is as good as mine. Ugh. The worst all the 24 seasons.

"This scraper/brush has cleaned off my cars very well through two New England winters so far.  The head telescopes out and locks firmly in place, pushing 6""-8"" of snow without collapsing.  It's true, the brush isn't very wide, but this makes it easier to use and store.  The scraper on the other side of the brush is great for a first pass at my frozen windshield and has maintained its edge after many uses.  Still, I'll use a hand scraper, not the scraper at the other end of the handle, to make a final pass at my windshield.

The brush has some weaknesses which you can easily work around.  After using your brush, fully extend it and give it a quick wipe to remove any water or snow.  If you don't, water will be trapped inside the unit and rust the shafts.  Also, the head may unscrew slightly when you push snow with the left corner of the broom.  But that will also cause the extension to unlatch, so only use the full brush and you'll be fine.

To clear up some confusion, it seems some items are shipped with a rubber squeegee.  This appears to slide over the scraper which is on the other side of the broom, hopefully able to be simply removed.  The brush I bought locally did not have this, but I sort of wish that it did.

Overall, this is a great brush for New England winters.  I'll be buying more for friends and family.",5.0,0

Yes, it probably cost more than perhaps a standard toilet, but it s finally something that I enjoy cleaning - yes, you read that right ""ENJOY""!

"Boy Meets World as a show was great. I enjoyed growing up along with it and I still enjoy watching it now. The first four or five seasons were really wonderful and things went slightly downhill after that. This final season didn't seem to have quite the same magic as the earlier ones but it didn't suck by any means. It was still very enjoyable but you could tell things weren't working as well as before. A lot of the story lines seem awkward or forced and many of the characters acted a little bit out of character in certain situations. In many ways there seemed to be a lot of more serious-toned episodes this season but they always felt very strange and often interweaved with the wackiness and more sit-com style they usually do all in the same episode. This often left you with an awkward feeling while watching. Overall I still recommend it though, especially if you're rounding out your collection. Despite it's pitfalls it's still better than most of the stuff out there. I am glad they ended it after this season though. It would have been a shame to drag it on like so many shows do today.",4.0,0
"If Jean-Luc Godard hated commercial film producers, why did he make a movie for them?  To make some adolescent point about how he, The Brave Artist, would never be cowed by the vulgar likes of Carlo Ponti or Joseph Levine, I suppose.  And to prove that he could get  Brigitte Bardot as naked, or naked-er, than her ex-husband Roger Vadim.
Somehow, though, I suspect that even Vadim would have done better by this material than Godard.  After all, he has a good cast (Bardot included), good source material (a novel by Albert Moravia), and the services of Raoul Coutard, one of the best cinematographers in the history of film.  And what to we get?  About 90 minutes of mind-numbing agony as Godard plays film-school in-jokes and stretches scenes out to tedium mostly to prove that he won't truckle to commerical interests.  But none of this adds up to real drama, either.  As a result, any honest audience will have to admit that they've been cheated, too.

"As others have noted, in this movie, the movie is set in a world that is not just a closed society but a world where most people have no basic rights, so it is not surprising that many people in the movie are in a position to enjoy the movie.  There are many people who have no rights because they do not have a basic right and are in a situation where they are forced to live with the consequences of their actions.  In this case, the movie is based on the book of the same name by the late writer William Wordsworth.  Wordsworth is famous for his work, and he wrote many great novels, including his famous ""The Tempest.""  Wordsworth's novel was inspired by the book of the same name and was the inspiration for the movie.

The movie also features some of the very best actors in the movie.  The film is directed by William Shakespeare and the cast is great.  I recommend this movie to anyone who loves a good story and a good acting performance.

The movie was made in the mid-1950s by John Henry Ewing, who was a large, well-known actor in Hollywood.  Henry Ewing was the son of the legendary actor William Ewing and was born in England in 1885.  Henry Ewing's father was a big comic actor who played a major role in the movie.  He was known as a hard-bitten and gruff man, but his father's character was very sympathetic and kind.  Henry Ewing's father was very good at sports, but his mother was a bit too shy and a bit too violent.  In the movie, Ewing is a bit of a troublemaker who",2.0,1

"When I heard there was going to be a Jurassic Park III, I thought it would suck. The ending to ""The Lost World"" was a great way to end the series.

The dino's are more detailed and relistic looking than the other two movies. The music on the other hand wasn't as good. John Williams didn't conduct the score for this one, so the music didn't quite have the same touch as the other two. Of course the movie had it's cheesy parts.

"Just purchased this cat tree a week ago. It arrived quickly and was better than I imagined. The cat houses were large enough for my adult cats. I was worried they might be a little small, but they were spacious enough for one cat to fit in a house at a time and roll around or hide in it. This is my cats first cat tree condo and it won't be their last.

When I purchased this cat tree I saw that there were similar trees for less money, but I chose this one by Armarkat because the reviews said it was sturdy. I must admit this cat tree was easy to put together and it is extremely sturdy. My cats jump on and off and climb it without any wobbling. I have two cats and both are about 13 lbs. The carpet material is a little on the cheapy side, but the cats enjoy it so I can't complain. I purchased the Kong catnip and sprinled some on the cat tree and my cats are in heaven and happy to be up off of the ground.

I have a 60lb terrier mix and this is his first time using this. He has been on it for about a month now and has started to get better. He is a very picky eater and his food is less full of junk and he does not like to eat anything else. It is not for a chewer. It is for the dog that is not a chewer.

This is high praise from one who couldn't watch all of the last Superman movie. DC may do better in their ensemble pieces, like Suicide Squad or the Justice League.

"This was a really interesting film. I think what the writer was attempting here was a look into our ""shadow"" selves. It definitely was trying to show that we are many different people, and we show different ""faces"" depending on who we are dealing with throughout our lives. I found the music to be somewhat annoying. I didn't might the drums so much but the creepy sexual undertones in an Ingmar Bergman style along with the 40's esc dramatic - and I might add ""irritating"" music. The switching to creepy black, and white; as well as the image of spiders also reminded me of Ingmar Bergman's style of cinematography. The scenes in which the characters didn't ""turn the damn lights on"" kind of bugged me. Again, the Director may have intentionally done this to show that sometimes we ourselves are not even aware of these different layers within our personality's.

"I am 36 years old, and I have four kids. Last year I decided it was time to lost the extra pounds that didn't come off after my 4th pregnancy, so after browsing amazon for some ideas I stumbled upon Jillian's 30 Day Shred and No More Trouble Zones. These videos work. If you are using proper form, working out 5-6 days week, and not overindulging on carbs/dessert you WILL see results. Here are my stats:

April 2009: 124 pounds, 5 feet 4 inches tall,  size 6

Workout/diet regimen: started with 30 Day Shred, moved on to No More Trouble Zones (since it had the longer ab workouts I wanted) for about 1 month almost daily. No diet, just cut back on snacks/dessert.

May 2009: 111 pounds, size 0 or 2 - total weight loss 13 pounds, about 10% of my body weight.

"I ordered this because I wanted something easier than the usual chicken carrot made from scratch cake that I usually make for the pup's birthday. It's definitely easy. Add the ingredients and stir. My oven was not working so I put it in a silicon bone shaped dish in the microwave for the 2 minutes it says on the box. The middle was still not cooked, I think I went all the way to 4 minutes and it still was not cooked in the middle, So I used a glass cot cut out the middle a little bigger than the uncooked part and put that back in the microwave for 1 minute and it finally got cooked. Put the middle back in and the dogs didn't mind at all. The icing was thin and the amount was small so I stretched it with some Greek yogurt, again, the dogs didn't mind. Since all this is silliness, it's up to you if you care about how it looks. The dogs when given permission eat every last crumb and they loved it. I might buy it again, this time I just had neck surgery and the oven was broke.

"I LOVE that they sealed the bottom of this warmer! My last one was a gift and it lasted nearly 5 years... but the mice like to get in under the heater in winter (no duh, right?) and this fall, when I went to plug it in, the wires had been chewed. The new product is totally sealed and I expect to use it for many years to come!

Also, they say ""do not use with an extension cord""... but I HAVE for all of those 5 years with no problem. Who has power to their chicken coop? Unless you are a big time farmer, you probably don't. So the trick is to use a hardy, outdoor extension cord and tie it up off the ground, so it is never sitting in water. If you live in a wet location, you could seal up the plug location with plastic bags or something.

"It's incredible how many movies are made by the studios in the last 30 years, and how many we get from them.

However, when I first saw this film, I felt that I'd missed something, and I'm not sure why. I was a little disappointed by the fact that this film doesn't have a lot of great dialogue, and the actors in the film do a great job of portraying them perfectly.

"I agree with many of all these less-than-impressed reviews of this movie.  I am really getting tired of how todays films depend so much on CGI.  It's just not perfected yet.  It still looks way too cartoonish which is very hard to take seriously.  I miss the sci-fi horror films of the 1980's.  Creating special effects WITHOUT CGI looked more realistic on film back then.

And what's more.  I have yet to see any Will Smith film worth watching twice.  He does ""big budget"" films, but they are generally all pretty lame in appeal.  His ""Wild Wild West"", ""Independence Day"", ""Men in Black"", ""I Robot"", etc.  These are just a few of some pretty lame big box office Hollywood films.

""Hitch"" didn't have any CGI, so I guess what made that film bad was just Will Smith himself.  Well, wait a minute.  It's not that I don't like Will Smith.  I just don't like any of his films.  Any actor could have replaced him in all those films of his, and it will still be an overblown, but still dull movie to me.  I guess I just don't care for his choices in his movie career.

It's not a full size light, but it's nice to have something that's more light than I've had before. I also like that the battery is made of metal and I can recharge it quickly. I recommend this light to anyone who is looking for a rechargeable flashlight. I've had mine for a couple of months now and it's very bright. I've seen some reviews that said it would be more expensive than a standard compact flashlight. But it's not. I don't have any flashlights that cost more than this one, so it's not a great deal for a small flashlight. But if you're looking for a cheap compact flashlight that you can recharge quickly, this is a great buy. The quality is good and the light is good quality.

"Volume 2 will continue the chronological release of the early sound Our Gang (Little Rascals) comedies from 1930 & 1931:
A Tough Winter
Pups Is Pups
Teacher's Pet
School's Out
Helping Grandma
Love Business
Little Daddy
Bargain Day
Fly My Kite
Big Ears

Jackie Cooper shines here as he falls for his teacher Miss Crabtree and has to compete with Chubby Chaney in ""Teacher's Pet"", ""School's Out"" & ""Love Business"".
Wheezer takes the main stage in ""Pups IS Pups"" but the early gang is all there as they invade an animal show with their exotic pets.
The gang's love for an elderly lady who acts as their Grandmother is heartwarming yet great fun in ""Helping Grandma"" & ""Fly My Kite"".
One clinker here is ""Big Ears"" which is a melodrama dealing with divorce.

Over all Volume 2 is much stronger than Volume 1, it is apparent that the Hal Roach Studios have become comfortable with their new sound apparatus and can now focus on producing funny comedies again.

For those looking for Spanky, he will not turn up until Volume 3.

"The World's End is a well-written action, middle-age life crisis, dark humored meets sci-fi film. The actors bring characters to life, making them believable. Like life, people aren't always what they seem; it's during crises that one's mettle is tested and who we are as human beings really revealed.

The movie isn't exactly what I thought it was going to be about, but was NOT disappointing in even a small dose! My teenagers caught some of the little ""pieces"" that relate to Simon Pegg's & Nick Frost's two previous films (""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Hot Fuzz""), which sometimes only consisted of, say, a piece of wrapper.

The Special Features were enjoyable to watch. Seeing the actors not in character as they talked about the writing of the film, what their vision was, and how it came about was fun.

I'll not write a summary of the movie-- you can get that anywhere. But the summary of our family's view of this film: We loved it! If you like British humor, if you liked Pegg's other two movies, then you'll likely enjoy this film, as well.

I just completed cutting and building a very intricate clock that was all fret work with this saw. It's outstanding to operate. Changing the blade and re-tensioning from one hole to the next is fast and easy to do.

This is by far the BEST dog toy I have ever invested in.  My 125 lb Rottweiler/Mastiff mix LOVES to play soccer and I was having to buy a soccer ball for him every few weeks because he would deflate it and then shred it to pieces.  This ball has been great for him...he loves this ball even more than soccer balls.  The grooves on it make it so easy for him to catch/fetch & the best part is it's heavy duty foam and will not deflate.  The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because the 1st one I bought only lasted about 4 months of heavy use before the thread/seams started coming apart.  Eventually it broke down and the canvas covering came off exposing the foam and had to be thrown out.  We are now on ball #2 and when this one gets torn up we will get another.

"Tiny, thin, handy as can be, simple as ... uhh ... simple, and cheap enough that I bought 5 of these and gave them out to co-workers. We all would occasionally find ourselves with the need for a knife or wrench or screwdriver, but the campus where we work is a ""no weapons allowed"" kind of place, so even a Swiss Army type knife might ruffle some feathers. Taking this little thing out doesn't raise anyone's eyebrows at all, and while it's not as effective as a Leatherman or something along those lines, it's still darned handy to have for popping open boxes, prying open stuff, and so on. Shipping took quite a long time - about a month - but considering that it's coming straight from China and you're only paying ONE DOLLAR apiece for these things, it's kinda hard to really gripe much.

Only complaint: The little page of instructions that tells what is what on this tool are entirely in Chinese. No English instructions whatsoever, so you've gotta guess what does what on this thing. I Googled it and there are some pics with numbers over each spot that list the function of each thing on this. Primarily, the handiest parts are the chisel-ground ""knife"" edge, the flat screwdriver corner, the ""saw"" section, and the bottle opener, in that order.

I could probably get a bit more usage out of it if I mixed the litter more often instead of never, but I tend to want to be near it as little as possible.

This box has huge benefits for me. I only have to think about litter around every two weeks, there are far fewer litter granules tracked around my house and they're less dusty. My one gripe so far is that it takes up quite a bit of room, though it's far less conspicuous than a litter robot.

"Working great for over a week.  My installation is a bit different.  I am using it to activate a WEMO switch to turn on 100+ feet of LED cafe lights outside.  I have these in weather proof/resistant enclosures and have good outside WIFI due to an access point I have outside.  I had to drill a 1/2"" hole in the enclosure for the motion sensor to work.  It can not sense anything through plastic or glass.  A plastic bag was successful during testing, but not how I wanted to install it.  For additional weather proofing, I used silicon on areas prone to water intrusion.  To link the sensor to the WEMO switch, I just used IFTT(If this then that website)  and a simple rule mated them well.(If motion detected, then turn on wemo)

Works super.  Turns on lights as desired and sends IFTT alerts as well(though this is hit or miss it seems).

Also, this set up is working with Alexa(amazon echo) so I can say, ""Alexa, turn off cafe lights"" and she goes to work.

"Alright, my fat cat isn't the smartest and hasn't figured out how to open the compartment. I do love not getting kitty attached (meow'ed excessively) anymore because she knows that at a certain time the noise comes and she eats. I just wish it was for a full 7 days to make it easier for me to remember to fill it. The numbers are at the bottom of each 1 cup section but black on black is hard for me to see. I've had it for almost a month and my cat was eating out of it in a few minutes the first day, the 2nd day almost no hesitation and after than, she sits quietly by it up to an hour before the timer opens the compartment and as soon as it starts to shift, she's eating. I really like the recording feature. I think it really helped the first 2 days but she doesn't need it anymore.",4.0,0

"The above line spoken by Oscar winner Hilary Swank is indicative of the dialog in this special effects driven sci-fi saga. Swank plays an astronaut who along with Bruce Greenwood must pilot Virgil, a craft designed to burrow (with the assistance of one really mean laser beam) to the earth's core in an attempt to correct an imbalance that was doing serious damage to the surface above.
Also along on this unbelievable trip to the earth's center are  respectable performers in stereotypical roles: Aaron Eckhart (the voyage's ""studly"" college professor), Alfre Woodard (mission commander), Delroy Lindo (the ship's inventor and symbol of self-sacrifice), Stanley Tucci (the despicable scientific genius with a hidden agenda), and Richard Jenkins as the mysterious military hardliner.

"The plot is good, the acting is good and the scenery is good.  The only fault I can find with this movie is the language.  The cursing is mild with only a few uses of three different expletives.  I have decided to rate (the many) movies I watch myself from the perspective of a Christian man looking for entertainment that won't teach my child to use curse words before her 3rd birthday.  I deduct 1 star for 1 or 2 expletives and automatically deduct another star for 3.  If I hear 4 or more or if any words are really offensive I stop it and it is rated 1 star regardless of any other considerations.  There is no nudity or blasphemous content.  This is one of those movies which makes no reference to God at all so it can't really be called Christian.

- My son likes the shape and will play with it from time to time.

- Several good soothing colors of light to choose from.

The not so good:

- The light it gives off tends to dim out fairly quickly (after a week or so) if you want to leave it on all night.  It does have a cool feature where it will turn off after 10-15 minutes (see description for actual lenght), but we need one that stays on all night.  A plug in light may work better for an all night light.

"This 2002 film explores the world of Bob Crane, the TV star of Hogan's Heroes in the 60s.  Based on the true story of his addiction to videotaping himself in erotic encounters with hundreds of women, we watch his life spin out of control.  His two marriages fail. He can't get jobs in Hollywood anymore. And he's all alone.
Greg Kinnear stars as Bob Crane.  His performance is excellent for its depiction of the shallowness of the man.  And Willem Dafoe, as John Carpenter, his best friend who entices Crane into a wanton lifestyle, gives an outstanding performance.  Carpenter works for SONY and introduces Crane into the world of home video. He also brings him to strip clubs, sets Crane up with women, and flatters him incessantly.  Crane gets hooked into this lifestyle and this leads to an inevitable violent outcome.
The script is somewhat lacking but the actors still manage to get into the skin of the characters.  However, it makes these two men seem somewhat different from those around them and never captures the real whirl of the early 70s, when the freedom of the times was gripping America. Also, I wish that every woman depicted in the film didn't come off as a lightweight bimbo.
The DVD had some long extras about Bob Crane's murder.  This was the era before DNA testing and so, even though there was a trial, nothing was ever proved.  There were just too many questions.  And too many people who might have had a motive.

"Family-oriented comedy ""Zoom"" has the right cast. Tim Allen is a retired, washed-up ex-superhero who is given a mission to train a group of misfit kids with special ability. The trainees are played by Spencer Breslin, Kate Mara, Michael Cassidy and Ryan Newman. The film also has decent production designs, and is supported by the veterans like Rip Torn and Chevy Chase. So far, everything is great. Well, it might not be great exactly, but you can at least expect a decent family picture like ""Sky High.""

However, the film is helmed by a wrong director, Peter Hewitt, whose previous works include first ""Garfield"" movie and ""Thunderpants"" (just in case you haven't seen it, the latter is a one-joke film about a farting boy). For all the charms and the talent of the cast, and the characters' likable nature, those would-be superheroes/heroines becoming transparent or making the body and limbs bigger like rubber ball, have already been done in ""The Incredibles"" or other films of the same genre. With some wit or twists added, those characters would have been more interesting. As it is, they remain just OK with the lazy direction and very familiar sight gags.

The film's weak script, which does not explain convincingly why these kids must be brought together and trained like this, is already a problem. But the saddest thing is, for me, watching Chevy Chase covered with greenish sticky slime coming out of a boy's nose. It's a worse kind of gag than pie-throwing.

I like Tim Allen, but it makes me sad to see his recent films like this and ""The Shaggy Dog."" The film is not as bad as the very low user rating of IMDb suggests and the father-daughter-like relations between him and Ryan Newman is credible, but except that (and cute Ryan Newman) I cannot think of the reason why this film had to be made.",2.0,0

"I needed to replace my existing Malibu driveway lights, they had become broken not working and mainly a pain to upkeep. When I received the Moonrays I thought there were parts missing from the box because of the way other lights had to be connected. After reading the instructions and seeing the parts and how they connect, I thought it was pure genius, so easy to connect the light fixture to the wire compared to the messy and bulky way the other brand did. I did notice the second one I connected didn't get pierced correctly so I skimmed a little of the insulation off the wire just where it should touch the piercing pins after that connecting them was a breeze and a pleasure. I figured some college educated engineer figured this new connection design would use more wire and thus the company could make more money. I like the way you can use them on a deck, patio or stake them in the ground. Any idiot that would leave the transformer on while connecting any electrical product should have his head examined. I needed more wire to span my driveway and 14/2 from Amazon works fine and is twenty cents per foot cheaper then HD & L's. Moonrays 11604 Cable Connectors for Low Voltage Landscape Lighting are the best I've ever used for splicing additional wire to the included system. They allow no cutting and stripping of wire ends and each one has a slot for 18g, 16g. and 14gauge wire so joining wire of different gauges was a very easy task. I just installed the system today so I don't have any history with the transformer, but I'm not thrilled about having the lights stay on all night and morning. I usually use timed transformers and shut the lights off at 1AM. I'll more than likely change them out after a week or so. No need to fill FPL's coffers any more than I have to. Oh and I know the price of the whole 10 light system is the best anywhere at Amazon.",5.0,0

"We adopted Beast, a 60 lb mutt in early October. He seemed to be great, until he started eating my boyfriends things when we were gone at work. My boyfriend decided to buy a camera so we can see what he's doing when we're gone. Lo and behold the poor guy is so anxious he is howling the whole time we are gone! We had no idea! It wouldn't really bother us, but we live in a small apartment and if too many people complain, we will be forced to get rid of him. We started to try everything, classical music, leaving the tv on, closing the windows, opening the windows, crating him, giving him a frozen bone or kong to distract him, yelling at him over the camera, taking him for a nice long walk before we go, EVERYTHING. nothing worked. We were at our wits end, we had just adopted him and now were at risk for losing him!! This collar was on sale for $20. We bought it. Finally, we left and watched him on the camera. He started to howl and the collar beeped 3 times, and when he didn't stop, it finally zapped him. Yes, it was heartbreaking to hear him yelp, BUT he stopped!! (and it would have been more heartbreaking to give him away). Finally!! He only wears it when we are gone and it's super important to put it on the right way, or else it won't work.
First you have to make sure it's right under his head, not low on the neck where a regular collar would sit, but literally right underneath his head.
Then you have to make sure it's tight to the point where the actual box won't move if the dog scratches/shakes. You should still be able to fit one finger in, but it should be TIGHT.
Then you have to give a good shake before you go, so it's touching the dog's skin, NOT HIS FUR!

"Unit is plastic and seems to be well made. It easily fits on top of a 5gal bucket, but does not snap on or fit tightly.  Only when the vac is running does it ""snug"" down for a tight fit.  So, it easily comes off when not in use, which is aggravating.  Also, when hoses are attached, you need to have the bucket anchored in some way or it will be falling over every time you move one of the hoses.  Once the bucket gets to be about half full, then it becomes more stable.  None of that is really the fault of the product though, but is a result of using the product.

It is a little heavier than I expected, but it has not had any issues with any of the components that I have installed. The light is very bright, and the color temperature is very nice. I have not had any problems with it being too bright. I would definitely recommend this unit to anyone.This is a very good lamp. I like the fact that it does not have a ""lock"" which means that it can be turned off with the ""lock"" button. I have no problems with this. The light is pretty small, but not too big. It is very bright. I like the fact that it is not too small, but not too large. I have been using it for about a month now and it is bright enough to see through very small objects. I would not recommend this lamp. I have a pair of these on my desk, and I have never had any issues with them. I have not had a problem with the light. I would highly recommend this lamp.I bought this to replace an old vanity that had a glass door.  The knob is very secure and the plastic hinges are solid and secure.

"Product feels heavy duty and well constructed. It has been great to have on hand for spreading out large / odd shaped oversized plugs/transformer blocks and for splitting UPS outlets to be able to plug in several small devices.  Only downside is also its positive - the product is heavy weight plus a bit bulky so it makes packing it in my laptop bag (for when traveling and a hotel or airport doesn't have enough outlets) a bit much.  Also, in other uses, it can be a bit hard to cable manage all of the transformer blocks when the weight of the splitter is enough to move pull on the transformer block.  Overall, however, I'd much rather have the cable heavy duty and the minor inconvenience of its weight is a good trade off.",4.0,0

"This is your typical cheap, made-in-China-esque product. That's fine, but it wasn't .99 - it was what, $6? I got it for evening walks with my dog and at first, I was really happy with it. It sheds a nice blue light and allows her to see where she's walking and, more importantly, allows passing cars to see both of us! It attached nicely to her collar.

Even before the clasp broke (in literally fewer than 10 uses), there were a couple issues--the light itself is very hard to turn on. I pressed both sides as hard as I could, and I ended up having to hit it against a wall to get the thing to turn on. Also, the clasp is difficult to get on a squirming dog. You'd think it would easily collapse so that you could slip it onto the collar...I don't want my dog wearing it all the time (just one more thing on her collar to jingle/get caught/etc.). But it's a hassle to get on. And yet, it broke after only a few uses!

"I bought this to mount Board Buddies on my Dewalt-744 table saw.  The saw has a 19.5"" fence, so I had to cut the aluminum slide on both ends with a hack saw so that the wood screw holes would be centered over an auxiliary wooden fence a.k.a feather board that I made.  The saw's aluminum fence is 1"" wide with screws on its back side away from the blade.  I had to replace the Dewalt screws with equivalent 2"" sheet metal screws to attach the featherboards.  I made the wooden fence out of two pieces of 3/4"" hickory so that it would be hammer-handle tough.  I needed two pieces to make the fence wide enough to take wood screws from the slider as it is 2 1/4"" wide.  The holes for the wood screws in the slider are set 1 3/4"" from the edge.  Ideally, one would make the featherboard out of one piece that is 1 1/4"" thick, but good luck trying to find some.

All went well until I had to screw the aliminum slide onto the auxilary wooden fence.  I drilled deep pilot holes.  But, two of the brass-colored wood screws provided with the slide snapped off when the screws got deep into the wood.  The first time it happened, I was able to recover by separating the two hickory boards and unscrew the stub because the screws fell exactly between the featherboards.  Then I decided to glue the boards together so that the screws would be more secure.  On my second attempt to mount the slider, a second wood screw snapped.  This one was much more difficult to extract.  I had to use a hand grinder to dig a pit around the stub so that I could get a lock wrench on it.

MY ADVICE:  use the stainless steel wood screws that are supplied with the Board Buddies instead of the cheap brass-colored screws that come with the slider.",3.0,0

After a year or so of constant use, the contacts form pits from the welding-like spark that takes place when the contacts separate.

"This would be great if I wasn't going to be home and wanted lights going on and off at various times during the day and night. But what I want to use it for is to run a water distiller for exactly 5 hrs. The other type of timer was not accurate. This one is, but each time I want to run it, I have to set the time to go on and then off and verify the day and the schedule. The next day always at a different time than the previous day, when I want to run the distiller for five hours, I have to set the timer again as to what time it should go on and then off and also set the day for it to run and whether it should repeat everyday, every other day etc...all settings that are insignificant to me.

I wish I could just set to run for five hours and have it turn off afterwards. It was a lot of money to pay for for what I needed: a simpler setup. I am sure it is great for turning lights on and off randomly, as it says it does.

I have it plugged in an outlet under a wall cabinet which has a light under it but I have to use a flashlight to view the digital screen. It protrudes beyond where the light can shine on it.

When setting the times, if you go past the number you wanted, you cannot reverse it, but have to go all the way around the 12 hrs to get back to the number you wanted. This goes for hours and minutes, days of the week etc, for each of the on and off settings. Kind of a hassle. Anyone know of a simpler timer?",2.0,0

"I seems odd to get all excited about a booklight, but this is honestly the best booklight I have ever owned and I have gone through a lot of them, being an insomniac night reader with an early-bedtime husband.

The most excellent feature on this little light is the very high quality metal gooseneck. It will move absolutely any way that you want it to go with ZERO bounceback. In addition to moving effectively right and left and up and down, the head of the light twists equally well and stays put.

The light itself is pleasing with 3 LEDs, and covers the page nicely from mass market paperbacks on up to hard cover releases (I have used it now for both, as well as a trade paperback.)  It is light enough to not bend or damage the book or be falling backwards.  The non-skid pad inside the back of the clip keeps it from sliding around the book or falling sideways as so many of my lights with slip on clips do.

The only caveat that I would mention is that you have to want a light that takes standard batteries.  This takes 3 AAAs, which I love as I can use rechargable batteries.  They are easy to change and don't add to much weight, but does make for a larger housing than some people want in their booklights.  I'll take that any day to having to dig up expensive and sometimes hard to find ""watch"" batteries.  I have yet to need to change the batteries after three large books worth of reading thanks to the LEDs.

"This took my cat less than a day to figure out. So that is good. But the design is not 100% perfect. I'm glad the base is more stable than the first Catit Food Tree. But still, it could have a bit more weight to be more bottom heavy.
The problem I quickly noticed is that kibble pieces can become trapped in places, and a cat can't get them out. I've attached pictures. Pictures #1 and #2 show where kibble pieces get stuck. If you have a declawed cat, there is no way they can get those pieces. A cat with claws will even have trouble. A human has to stick their fingers in and dislodge the kibble pieces.
Picture #3 shows a kibble piece that perfectly fits inside the little circle that says 1, 2, or 3. (letting you know the degree of difficulty on the rotating disc). That kibble piece is also stuck, and a human has to dislodge it. You don't need a little circle that says 1, 2, or 3. Food gets stuck there.
These areas where kibble can get stuck, will be frustrating to a cat who is trying to get it.

I have also discovered that the middle level with the rotating disk does not lock in place. If I set it to 3 (the hardest setting with the smallest holes) my cat can EASILY rotate it to level 1 (the easiest setting with the biggest holes). What is the point of having different settings to make the puzzle easier or harder, if it does not lock in place?

But everything considered,  I guess I do like Catit Senses 2.0 Food Tree, and my cat is doing well with it so far.
I am hoping they make a 3.0 version with a  heavier base and no areas where kibble pieces can get stuck.",4.0,0

Started watching this on my Blue-Ray but found I could not reverse or speed forward. It just stops the movie. I notice that many commented how difficult it was to read the white-letter captions when foreign [ non-English ] words were being spoken but I did not find this to be a problem at all. It would have been nice to have closed captions for the English as well because of the pronunciation of the Spanish words.

The main problem I had was the issue of having to watch the entire movie without being able to reverse or speed forward.

I  will try it on my DVD player [ when I have access to it ] to see if the functions work better on a different device. This is the only reason it did not get five [5] stars. Otherwise.....

The sounds are loud and remind me of (if you can fathom this) a raspy-throated human infant processed through a vocoder synth. Our lab seemed a little scared of it at first (as was I!) but she quickly got the deal and loves it now.

She's a medium-large 75+ pound yellow lab yet she can't quite get her jaws far enough around the ball to carry it - if it were just an inch or so smaller in diameter it would be perfect. But she loves to nudge it around the living room and through corridors.

It's extremely hard plastic and durable - she plays with it inside and out, though the sounds carry far less outdoors (fine by me!).",4.0,0

I walked away from the theater, which had 6 other people in it, going seriously, I paid for this?? Even my 19 year old son wasn't impressed and he scares easily. I kept waiting for the feeling of fear to hit me and it never did. I looked at my phone to check the time and it was an hour in already and nothing fantastic had happened yet.

My 24 year old daughter saw it before me and told me you had to believe in order for it to scare you. I do believe there are spirits and hauntings, yet I couldn't get this movie to scare me one bit until the very last scene, which I won't divulge and ruin it for people. Every time the story line would move toward scary, it suddenly shifted away.

I watch shows like A Haunting and Extreme Paranormal and in my opinion, those are scarier than Paranormal Activity. I wasn't impressed and wanted my money back.

The Healthy hide rawhide has some extra potato starch, salt, soybean oil, vitamin E (100 IU), and preservatives.  The Healthy Hide sticks have almost ZERO SMELL.

The Healthy hide sticks come with 20 sticks but they smell like plain old rawhide and my dog just leaves it lying around.

"I have an anxious dog.  His anxiety is not such that my Veterinarian has recommended ""serious"" drugs for management, but I do like to try out the over-the-counter offerings like this one with him.

The big downside of this nutraceutical is palatability... neither of my dogs liked the taste and would ""eat around it"" when it was in their food.  I could easily ""pill"" them with it, but that's a hassle and I don't think it's particularly helpful to force things on an already anxious dog.  They would not eat it even when it was combined with peanut butter or had cheese wrapped around.  They are, admittedly, kind of picky, but that made this product unsuitable for us.

The ingredients are
Active Ingredients (Per Tablet)
Chamomile - 150mg
Passionflower Powder - 100mg
GABA (Gamma Amino Butyric Acid) - 100mg
L-Theanine - 50mg
L-Tryptophan - 33mg
Thiamine (Mononitrate) - 4mg
Ginger Root Powder - 2.5mg
Inactive Ingredients Beef flavor, brewers yeast powder, liver powder, magnesium stearate, cellulose, silicon dioxide, stearic acid, thiamine mononitrate.

These are interesting and not ones I have seen combined before.  Theoretically, the L-tryptophan and L-theanine, in particular, could have calming effects, although the research jury is still out on everything from dose to actual efficacy.  I do think this comes under the heading of ""mostly harmless,"" although you should always check with your Vet about anything with which you plan to attempt to treat your pet long term.

This is certainly affordable, compared to a few of the other popular over-the-counter remedies.  Be aware that it is very common for it to take 6 weeks or longer before you see effects from any nutraceutical.  Cautions on this product indicate that it hasn't been proven safe for pregnant or lactating bitches, and that it should be discontinued 5 days before any general anesthesia is administered.",3.0,0

For less than $30, I purchased this battery and received it within two days. (I have Amazon Prime). It charged and worked as I expected it to. You cannot go wrong with this battery and it has served me well thus far.",5.0,0

"This is a movie based on a controversial trial, where everyone's opinion then and now is already made and we all KNOW she was guilty of the conspiracy...  But was she?  This production will not answer the question, but takes the viewer, with our XXI mind through the trial process, the witnesses accounts and evidence presented at the trial.  we all know the story and the facts, but watching this movie is a great way to question the process, the fundamental principles of justice and the moral dilemma that the main character had to face - in real life.  This is movie shows us that the trial was as much about the conspirator as it was a trial of the defense lawyer and makes you ponder how would you have reacted if you were a juror? how about if you were the lawyer?

"This is an excellent documentary about Allen's entire career.  There are many, many film clips and they are all choice highlights from his films.  Interspersed with these clips are interview segments with Allen present day and during earlier days.  There are also clips of mini interviews with the people with whom he has worked, including Tony Roberts, Diane Keaton, Scarlett Johannsen, John Cusack, Owen Wilson, Mariel Hemingway, Gordon Willis, Marshall Brickmann, Martin Scorsese, his sister Letty Aronson, now his producer, Dick Cavett and so forth.  Although Mia Farrow is covered, she does not participate in any way since they have never resumed contact in any way. She was, of course, Allen's other major leading lady but he ended up having an affair and marrying her adopted daughter years ago.

Even though I have seen every single one of his movies, I really liked the choice of film clips presented here.  It was very enjoyable to see them and to learn some of the tidbits about what else was going on while making them.  Everyone contributed some major insight about the film clip which was unknown to us before.

I also enjoyed the way he present day took us to his old school or walked down the street with his sister and they talked to present New Yorkers.  There was even old footage shown of his parents who finally died near the century mark.

Although the focus was on the work, there was enough of a human dimension presented here to make this a very important summing up of a creative life while the creator is still around to share it.  If you love his work, you need this film in your collection.

"Note - I was provided this product for review. I don't know that I was prepared to like this leash as much as I do. It's a solid, well made leash and I *never* feel as though I am not in control of the animal. I've been using this for my 90 lb Lab, and while he can be a tad rambunctious on the leash (particularly when the squirrels are out), this leash makes control pretty easy. I think my favorite part is the elastic-type that allows the dog to feel graduated tension before the leash becomes taut. I actually found my dog slowing down of his own accord when the leash started tightening up. Then there's what I think of as the short-hold-handle, that spares me from having to wrap the leash around my hands if I want to shorten the lead for whatever reason. In sum, this is a really good leash. I found the clasp to be a little sticky, but some WD-40 took care of it and it works well. I don't have any qualms about using this leash.",5.0,0

I decided to tile my house and used a tile saw that has seen a fair amount of usage and it was time for a new blade as the old one was chipping the glazed porcelain tile really bad. I noticed this blade was much larger than the old one but I can only assume that is due to the amount of wear on the old one. This worked well for about 40 cuts then started chipping the tiles also. I ended out buying a much better blade and it hasn't chipped a single one yet. I guess I should know you get what you pay for.,2.0,0

"If your using Tidy Cat your not using the best.  We where faithful Tidy Cat purchasers for over 10 years then after taking up our carpets to go back to the hardwood underneath we where shocked by how much litter was in and under the carpet, yes we vacuum.
Within a week of having hardwood floors again we where shocked how much litter was all over the house, not to mention in the bed - ughh.  Also we found that Tidy Cat wasn't clumping as well as it use to and we were always fishing out tiny clumps too.
Well it was time to do something about the mess so we decided to try a different litter.  WOW if you have never used Cat's Pride Fresh and Light litter you have to try it!  Tidy Cat is like little balls, Cat's Pride is not.  Cat's Pride is a very light litter which is a big plus, no strong scent and clumps great!  We have 2 covered litter boxes side by side one still with Tidy and one with Cat's Pride. I put a 4' x 5' piece of astro truf (outdoor type) in front of the boxes and still have to sweep Tidy off the hardwood in that room, hallway and adjoining rooms but no Cat's Pride.

"Purchased this for my adopted puppy. He was 10 months old, and over 90lbs when we got him. He came from a neglectful home, had never walked on a leash and was not trained at all. He pulls a lot on the leash, and is a jumper. A regular collar and leash was not cutting it. The only attention he got at home before was when he jumped up on his owners, which he did to us, then got him over excited and he began to mouth and nip. At almost 100lbs, this normal puppy behavior did a lot of damage.
This product is well constructed, and good quality. It comes with an instructional DVD as well. However, I followed the DVD, and eased him into sizing and wearing this, gave him lots of love and treats during the whole process. He seemed fine with it and I tried having him wear it for a couple seconds at a time and went from there. He didn't seem to have a problem wearing it. However, when it came to actually using with a leash, my dog simply would not have it. He would struggle and/or flop to the floor and not move, and he always found a way out of the nose piece, even though it fit the way the video said it should. My dog is very stubborn and the most I could ever get him to walk on this was one lap around the living room. I wish this had worked for us, but it just wasn't a good fit for us. We bought the ""Easy Walk Dog Harness"" by the same brand at the same time, thinking we'd start with this one and work our way up to just the regular harness. It didn't work out that way, but the easy walk hardness was a much better fit. Don't give up too quickly if you have a difficult dog, or are an inexperienced dog owner like I am.",3.0,0

"I won't add anything about the movie itself, but will comment on the commentary by Anthony R Santoro.  I have been reading about Prussia and Germany for many years and just finished ""The Iron Kingdom"" by Christopher Clark.  It is an excellent book about the history of Prussia from 1600 to 1947.  After finishing the book and then listening to the commentary by Santoro, I am shocked by the total inaccuracy of his commentary.  It was like returning to the1940 USA propoganda about Germany.
Great movie but almost everything about the commentary (which must be turned on) is a fiction.
Germany before and during WWII was not a cartoon character, and serious study must be undertaken to understand Prussia and Germany.  If USA citizens knew the history of the German States their attitude towards Germany would change dramatically.

The USA is blessed to not be bordered by more powerful countries; Germany historically was dominated by Russia, France, GB and Austria.

My degree in history came in handy for this film.  With attention to detail, the film is not only breathtaking in scope, scenery, and impact, it is a living history wherein you can see a slice of 18th century life.
The film is another rendition of James Fennimore Cooper's famous tome.  However, it's 100x better than the old Hollywood film of the same name.  This one is nuanced, showing the motivation of the French as well as the English, the nature of the Indians fighting for each side (i.e. the French-Indian War), as well as the colonists (i.e. us) who are cast adrift by an English parent country itself under siege by the powerful French regime opposing them in every (war) theatre.

The movie covers the daughters of the English commanding officer in the area and their struggle to survive in an incredibly hostile wilderness, beset by the French&their Indian allies, and the spectre of being alone.  Somehow, some of the heroes survive while others do not.

The cinemetography, musical score, and fine screenplay just seal the deal; a must-have film...",5.0,0

"I have had this saw for a couple years now and I have not had a problem with the blade.  The blades are very sharp and the blade is very solid.  I would definitely recommend this saw to anyone.  I would buy it again if I had to.Great for the money.  I have used the most of the blades in the shop.  I like the blade for my keychain and I like the blade for my wallet.  It's very easy to open and close the blade.  The blade is very secure and is easy to store.  I'm sure it will last a long time.  The blade is very stable.  It's a very good quality saw.  I would recommend this to anyone.  I have a large box of blades and this saw is a great tool to keep in the glove compartment of my car.

Very happy with purchase.Good product.This is my second pair of these, and I really like the quality of the material on the other.  They are very easy to install, and the rubber part of the handle is very easy to peel off.  The size of the handle is very nice, and it's very comfortable to wear.

"Thought I was stuck replacing my 30 year old vent unit due to bearing rumble in the fan motor. The local electrical shop said they couldn't find a replacement. Was more than willing to gamble on this as a replacement when I saw it. As others mention, the vibration isolation is not as good on this as it was in the 30 year old model so it's a little louder, but great compared to the bearing noiseI've been living with for years! My old unit had a stud that held the grill in place where this unit only has a hole. The clearance under the bracket made it difficult to find a bolt (used a panhead & filed it down) that would clear the motor.
It touches the motor and transfers Vibrations to the grill. I think sometime when I feel like messing with it I'll put a NutCert in the bracket and lock tight a stud into it, but for now it's fine and I didn't have to crawl around in the attic insulation to fix it!

"Jeanette MacDonald shines like a bright Northern star in this 1933 MGM classic also starring Ramon Novarro. Novarro was a matinee idol at MGM during the silent era; in 1922, after filming ""The Prisoner of Zenda,"" MGM executives brought him into their studio as the Latin lover after the sudden and unexpected demise of Rudolph Valentino. Novarro had only two years in his contact with MGM when he did ""The Cat and the Fiddle."" Novarro offers a brilliant performance as Victor Florescu, a talented, Brussels-based composer of serious music under the tutelage of respected Professor Bertier. When he meets beautiful Shirley Sheridan (MacDonald), a New Yorker living in Brussels as a professional Opera singer, the two bohemians fall in love. The story is a musical comedy and the songs from the Kern-Harbaugh stage musical comedy is used largely intact. Jeanette MacDonald's ""The Night Was Made for Love"" later became a big hit. This pre-code film is not without controversy with regards to the moral codes, since MacDonald and Navarro are portrayed as live-in companions.

Many movie critics and fans were used to Novarro in silent movies and they were less enthusiastic about his talkie movies. In fact some of the greatest silent stars of MGM had difficulty making success when talkies came along. I for one enjoyed this romantic comedy tremendously. I thought MacDonald and Novarro made lovely couple and the story is full of warmth.",5.0,0

"Beautiful well-fitting faucet with well constructed hardware that operates smoothly.

First of all, you'll need a baseplate for most installations as the faucet does not come with one. This one:
Hansgrohe 14019001 Baseplate Kitchen Fits All, 10 Inch, Chrome
fits perfectly and the chrome matches the faucet. It costs around $40.

Next, the instructions are not particularly helpful for the non-plumbers among us. We hired a plumber for the installation. He was able to complete the task in about 80 minutes and charged $85. Note that if you have a separate spray attachment on your sink, you'll need to remove that and cap the hole.

The faucet has a switch on the top to go from smooth flow to spray, and the end of the faucet can be pulled out so that you can fill pots that are beside the sink using full flow. This is a significant feature.

This is not a small faucet, and it's just a little too tall for a small kitchen with a standard sized double sink. However, while it might look a little disproportionate, this improves the convenience factor since there will never be the possibility of something not fitting under the faucet and into the sink. It's a great faucet for larger sized sinks.

The handle works well to adjust both flow rate and temperature. Note that the faucet favors the right-handed person due to the position of the handle. No leaks, drips, or other annoyances. In use, the faucet is quiet. I'm very happy with the end result.",5.0,0

"During the seventies, german director Werner Herzog has given us three movies - AGUIRRE, THE WRATH OF GOD, KASPAR HAUSER and HEART OF GLASS - which stay as unique pearls in Movie History. This director is a visionary,  one of the rare authors who have been able to create a cinematic world out  of their dreams. Just watch and listen to the featurette (Thank you, Anchor  Bay): this guy is an authentic genius coming from the same family of the  Saints of the Middle Ages or the most famous composers.
NOSFERATU, shot  in 1978, tries to establish a link between the german directors of the  1918-1926 period, Fritz Lang or Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau for instance,  authors who reigned over international cinema at that time and the new  generation of german directors that appeared in the late sixties with such  remarkable individuals as Rainer-Werner Fassbinder, Wim Wenders or Werner  Herzog.
Werner Herzog is also the last of the XIXth german romantics with  his images haunted by nostalgy, with his heroes able to see what is  invisible to common people. You have to enter into NOSFERATU as if you're  about to dream. If not, you'll surely be bored after 5 minutes. But if you  find in yourself the courage to follow Werner Herzog, you will experiment  something you'll never forget.
Other Werner Herzog's movies will be  released in the DVD standard very soon, so be prepared to dream.

"If you're willing to watch a movie about time travel, you're already watching a movie with an impossible plot device, so all other twists should be taken in context.  It is a typical cause-effect-cause inversion loop, raised a few levels and loops.  There are no branching timelines or alternate realities.  There is no ""time paradox,"" unless you count its inception, which I still haven't figured out solidly.  Its well-acted and skillfully laid out so that many of the bigger, more radical plot jumps are easier to buy into.  There's a central gender twist that many of the negative reviews are hung up on ... but those reviews don't even cite the correct gender issue, as if it were a modern psychological political progressivist political gender issue, even tho' this gender issue is physical was dealt with exactly as it would have been back then (and often today). Still, it's a contrivance that's essential to the plot, but revealed carefully and orderly so you can focus on the characters and how things play out (unless you're hyper-sensitive about normalcy).  If you're attentive, as you figure out the first few twists, you'll find the later twists easy to predict.  But I still haven't figured out two points: 1. The prime mover of the cycle of events  2. the motive for the agency causing what they cause  3. how the agency first caused what they cause.  (Okay, that's three, but they overlap.)

"These bees are supposed to be replacements for the beehive toy, but these toys are great individually! Last year I bought my dog the chipmunks and the tree stump and wanted to get the chipmunks replacement this year, but they were $3 dollars more than these! If you watch the price it could go down to about $4.50. It's an awesome deal! Dog toys are expensive and these are made so well. My dog loves any thing with a squeaker and even though hes 14 pounds, he destroys every time I've given him except for these Kyjen chipmunk/bees etc. They're a great treat for dogs who love toys and they're economical since they last for a very long time! I definitely recommend them and I will buy them again as soon as they hit the four dollar mark ;)

edit jan 21st
sad to say, but I have to take down 2 star... these toys are awesome little things that my dog loves to throw in the air and catch, but the squeakers inside are horrible! The squeakers inside last about an hour, but they never squeak again... they're very poorly made. The squeaker inside has two parts and the little thing that makes the squeaker squeak always slides out. Then the squeaker part always gets smashed within an hour that my dog gets bored of it. That's the only problem with this toy which is kind of a big deal since the whole point is for it to squeak! Anyways they are very durable and if you just replace the squeaker, your dog will be able to enjoy this toy for a very long time :)",3.0,0

"After viewing ""His Last Vow,""  I am left absolutely stunned and I cannot wait to see what happens next.  I sympathize with fellow reviewers who have been disappointed to see a Sherlock that is less than heroic; less ""in control.""  However, his behavior in Season 3 just goes to show how important John Watson is to the stability and grounding of an almost out of control force that is Sherlock Holmes.  There are moments in ""His Last Vow"" that are simply heartbreaking to watch. The plot is completely unpredictable and left me on the edge of my seat.  Despite many harrowing moments, what carries the day is that these two friends clearly understand and trust each other despite their suffering.  This goes beyond a simple ""bromance.""  This relationship is epic and makes this version of Sherlock Holmes the most compelling I've seen.

Still, he makes appearances (being ascended) from time to time and his replacement (an Alien with the ability to learn new things quickly) does a fine job.

Really, the season barely misses a beat.  And while Season 9 and 10 changes our cast radically with RD Anderson leaving the main spot (don't consider any of this spoiler alerts since the show's logo include pictures of the actors involved each year), Season 6 maintains our other characters (as well as Daniel Jackson from time to time) so it gets 5 stars from me.

Tendency to chew( similar to soft plush dog toys). I allowed him time to become familiar with the bed before placing into crate. In my opinion, this helps me correct him to not bite on the bed.

"I got this originally because I was into the Lorelei's Grasp based on reviews I read. I'd never seen a Naschy go this way or that way, and ended up watching Horror rises from the Tomb first and really dug it. If you're still harboring prejudice against Spanish horror films from the 70s based on the old bad dubbed VHS cropped dupe days, well, arise and be free. The film looks great and is full of wondrous stuff for Eurosleaze fans - a great mix of Gothic trappings, lurid horror and Naschy writing in scenes where he gets to paw his actresses' naked breasts every five minutes. Oh Paul, what are we going to do with you?

Ironically I like it better thah Lorelei, the reason I bought the set! It can be frustrating: a slimy rubber glove claw hand is offing nubile babes at a boarding school, one by one, and all the local polizei (it's German) can do is treat the girls like idiots and send them back to their rooms, then shake their heads in disbelief when they're murdered two minutes later... ""we did all we could"". Some people like movies where cops are staking out a school being attacked nightly by a monster, and then one of the girls complains there's breathing in her room and the cops just think she's imagining it and then act surprised an hour later when she's dead -- oh those hysterical women!

"Wonderboys is an artsy film. It is about as far from the mainstream as you can get. Homosexuality, dead dog in the trunk, marijuana/alcohol abuse: such subject matter makes WB decidedly NOT a family or date movie. Not one you would watch with your mom. Wonderboys is best watched with open-minded friends or alone at night after a weird day. Masterful performances by Michael Douglas, Tobey Maguire, and Robert Downey, Jr.

 Michael Douglas is a college writing professor at a small school in Pennsylvania. He is having an affair with the chancellor's wife, and his second novel is either stalled or out of control. Enter James, his oddball class prodigy. Played by Maguire, James' pale face and helpless demeanor leads Douglas to take him under his wing. But instead of providing fatherly guidance, Douglas and his editor pal Robert Downey Jr. lead James on lots of frat-boy hijinks.

"Vanilla Sky is a visually and intellectually fascinating film that many viewers and critics found too confusing to enjoy. What starts out as a surreal mystery turns out to be an exploration into the nature of reality. In this way, it is similar to The Matrix, Dark City and some other recent films where the characters are never sure what is real and what is a dream (or computer-generated fantasy). Vanilla Sky also has some David Lynch-like features, as when people's identities seem to randomly morph. Unlike Lynch films such as Mulholland Drive, however, Cameron Crowe's story at least offers an explanation for the confusion. The explanation won't satisfy everyone (as some of the harsh criticism of the film shows), but to focus too much on this is to miss the point, which is to make us ponder some big questions regarding truth and reality. Helped by some very good performances by Tom Cruise, Penelope Cruz and Cameron Diaz, and some stunning visual effects (such as a truly eerie scene of a deserted New York City), Vanilla Sky is an entertaining and intellectually stimulated film.

"I tried this on recommendation from Bob O-Brian of Luthier Mercantile International. ( LMI)  It works exactly as advertised for filling grain, especially in fine hardwoods like those used in guitar building or refinishing. Dries fast and clear. Sands easily. Very little odor. Non toxic. Water based. Builds fast but is not a heavy tone-killing finish so it is great for acoustic or semi acoustic instruments. Remember to do small sections, because it dries fast. Other than that small caution, I can wholehearted recommend this water based finish. You can see a good demonstration video here:

It is between ""Lady Killer"" and ""Smart Money""  as follows. The Heart is a Lonely Hunter stars Alan Arkin as John Singer, who is deaf. Singer moves from a small town in order to be close to his institutionalized deaf and mentally impaired friend Antonapoulos (Chuck McCann). Singer rents a room with a family whose father, Mr. Kelly (Biff McGuire), is unable to earn a living due to a serious injury. His teen-aged daughter Mick (Sondra Locke, in her film debut) is at first resentful of Singer's presence, but he ingratiates himself by introducing her to classical music (which he can ""feel,"" if not hear). Singer likewise tries to brighten the lives of such unfortunates as alcoholic Blount (Stacy Keach Jr. , also making his first film appearance), dying black doctor Copeland (Percy Rodriguez), and Copeland's poverty-stricken daughter (Cicely Tyson). ??????????

"I knew nothing about Tammy Faye Bakker prior to seeing this film and I was surprised not only at how fascinating her life has been, but also just how fascinating she is period.  The jovial tone of the documentary is really the key to the film for a couple of reasons.  First, it allows us to have fun at Tammy Faye's expense (and besides her make-up, there is still much about her that is worth poking fun at -- the archival footage of the Bakkers hosting a show while Tammy Faye was hooked on prescription drugs is the film's highlight), and her participation in the fun makes it easier for the audience to laugh along.  Secondly, to allow us to look back on her past hardships with so much humour, instead of bitterness, does give the impression that she is one hell of a survivor.  My impression of Tammy Faye before seeing the documentary had been cemented by the mainstream media, which has made her out to be a rich, spoiled and corrupt witch.  So you can imagine my shock as I realized that Tammy Faye had completely won me over by the end of the film.  My immediate reaction to this was that I had been manipulated and I complained that the directors must have felt too much affection for Tammy Faye since the audience was never exposed to the evil side of her character.  However, after considering the film a little more, I realized that Tammy Faye is likely to be too self-unaware and too much of an exhibitionist to actually hide the less pleasant aspects of her personality.  This is what makes her the perfect documentary subject.  Whether the camera is there or not, Tammy Faye's personality is as constant as her permanent eyelashes.",4.0,0

His good-guy image is central to the suspense in this film that works hard to keep the viewer from believing that Ford is the true villain.

Far too much time is spent on frontal face shots of Michelle Pfeiffer mulling over the spooky experiences she has after sending her daughter off to college.  Here again another diversion, the empty nest syndrome, is used to keep attention away from the true villain, Ford. The plot is transparent from the start, and we find in the end that Ford really is the true villain.  But everybody loves Harrison Ford, who just doesn't hack it as a villain.

"This is a very preliminary review. I'm a little miffed that I'm even writing it. Nest/Google survey ""encouraged"" me to come here and do it even though my protects have only been installed for about 2 days. I normally would just ignore their desires and do this on my own time but it's annoying enough to share with you. First, nothing ever gets a 5 star review from me without reason. I start at the middle of the road (3 stars in this case) and find reasons to add or subtract from there. So, -1 for annoying marketing department causing me to review this but I kind of understand why... The previous gen 1 protects were a flop from what I've researched. Add 1 point for others reviews saying that these things actually do what they say they are going to do without false alarms. That leaves us at 3/5. Add 1 point for combining multiple smoke and co detection methods. Add another for creating a ""mesh"" network of interconnected detectors that can calmly and efficiently inform me of situations. Subtract a giant 1 point (hard time limiting this to only 1 star) for NOT integrating with other wired detectors. The orange/red wire exists for a reason and that's to kick off alerts in other areas!! I will buy more of these units until all in my home are replaced. 4 so far but have a half dozen or so to go in the next weeks/months assuming I don't find issues. Love the nightlight, btw.",4.0,0
"I have my chains sharpened professionally when they begin to cut crooked due to uneven wear.  Otherwise, I touch them myself as soon as they fail to cut uniform shavings.  This usually occurs after about an hour of cutting hardwoods or two hours of softwoods.  If the bar gets into the dirt or you hit a nail you will be sharpening even sooner.  You can either carry several chains to get you through the day or be prepared to touch them up on the bar.

I prefer to touch up my own chains because the saw shops usually take off about 2MM of steel when they sharpen.  At that rate, a chain does not last very long.  If you touch up your own chains when they first begin to dull, you will only take off a few thousandths of an inch.

This tool works well if you gauge the grinder off of the tooth as described in some of the other posts.  The problem is powering the grinder while in the field.  Cordless grinders don't hold a charge very long so you need to carry extra batteries.  Corded grinders need a place to be plugged in.  Either solution limits you mobility.

I prefer the ""Oregon"" brand file and gauge.  No electricity required and it easily goes in your thigh pocket or field kit.  Only one or two strokes per tooth needed for a touch-up and you are back to work.  The gauge make it easy for even a neophyte to maintain proper tooth shape and depth.",3.0,0
"The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel in the World"" is a documentary about a hotel that was built by the owner of the Marigold Hotel.  The hotel was built in the late 19th century and was owned by the wealthy Charles LeBarre.  This is a wonderful story about the true story of the hotel owner and his wife, the owner of the Marigold Hotel.  It is a very entertaining documentary that gives a strong picture of the hotel owner's life and how he managed to survive his gambling addiction.  The documentary does a great job of giving us a glimpse into his life, and the real life that he was in his 30's.  It is a wonderful story of the hotel owner and his wife.I loved this movie. It was a good movie and I was impressed with the story. It was not the best of the bunch. I think the ending was a little hard to follow.This is a movie that is good for kids.

"I have other ""drive-in"" tapes from Madacy and am quite happy with them. TRACK OF THE VAMPIRE sounded intriguing, and the price was right. I was all set to lambast this film, until I read the other reviews and was informed that there was footage missing. I love 50's trash horror, bad acting, etc. , but I wasn't prepared to be as bored as I was. I guess I don't equate bad acting with sleepwalking. And what was with that overlong deal with the dancer on the beach? Suddenly, it was over. On came a Betty Boop cartoon. I thought OH JOY! The cartoon wasn't even that good, though Ms. Boop showed maximum cleavage and overt sexiness, apparently before she ran into trouble with the Hayes code (1932). Surprise! The second film, NIGHTMARE CASTLE was blessedly interesting. Directed by Allan Gruenewald (real name: Mario Caiano) and starring the wonderfully confident Barbara Steele, we have here a film of great style, if not substance. Though poorly dubbed, fans of this genre don't really care. I didn't. Lotsa schlock & silly stuff entertained. Upon further investigation, I was interested to find out that TRACK was actually pasted together with footage from a Yugoslavian film and originally released by AIP as BLOOD BATH. Forget this version of TRACK, but CASTLE is definitely worth a look. Quality of print is also questionable. Madacy did a much better job with BLOOD CREATURE/WEREWOLF IN A GIRLS' DORMITORY.",2.0,0

"Sweet knife. Fit and finish was spot on. blade was centered and strait in the handle when closed. Opening is smooth and easy. Lock up with liner lock is tight with no play in any direction. Pretty dang sharp out of the box. That being said, the edge is very fine and I rolled about a third of it over in the middle of the blade just dinking around the house with it to get used to it. A quick hone and a few strokes on the strop brought it back easily. I'll update stars and review after I get some time in on it out in the field.

It should be noted that this thing is pretty large for an EDC/utility knife. It's heavy for it's size as well, largely due to the solid stainless liners. The blade is broad, but the flat grind mitigates that a bunch.

Update - So, I've had this thing a while now and it's been a great blade. I would dock half a star if I could due to the blade having lost it's centering when folded. It now rubs a bit on the liner, though it's not enough to hinder the opening of the knife. I carry it daily and use it daily as well. I feel like I've done anything out of bounds to get the blade to off center like it has. I take care of my gear. That all being said, it's still reliable and a great performer. It holds the edge well and is easy to touch up in the field with my pocket hone. I still recommend this knife and have bought the Rat II and am waiting on a D2 version the the Rat I.

"no more rusty rake! this little kit is a must have for any scoopfree box! i've been using it for a month and cleaned it for the first time this morning. the dirt wipes off easily like butter (excuse the image. :P). the reason i gave it four stars instead of five is because i just encountered a problem this weekend. when i installed the rake a month ago, i noticed the two 'ears' if you will, were slightly scraping the side of the box. it wasn't an issue at the beginning until i realized this past weekend, instead of raking the box with the bottom of the tines pointing forward, the rake is raking with the top of the tines pointing forward, which completely defeated the purpose of the box. i'm guessing the box was giving the rake a counter-force at the 'ears' where they are scratching each other. it made the rake move harder. i was able to fix it in about 15mins. here's how:
1, take the rake out of the box (if you have one installed). 2, place the forever rake in place. do NOT screw in yet. observe the location where the ears and the box touch (if they don't in your case, skip step 3. ). 3, use your hands to reshape the rake slightly so NO contacts whatsoever occurs between the ears and the sides of the box. BEWARE: it is very easy to bend the ears. so be gentle. 4, install the rake as instructed. hope this helps. enjoy the clean rake.",4.0,0

"I have been using this product for more than two weeks now. In that time, I've had an opportunity to evaluate both the quality of the product and the overall usability. In creating this review I've considered both the type of material used in making the product as well as the overall fit and finish. I've also considered how well the product meets my needs and whether there are any shortcomings or particular advantages in using this product.

For this particular product, the type of material used in the manufacture and creation of the product seems to be of very good quality. One must consider that for any product of this type there is a balance between the type of material used and the cost that is to be passed on to the consumer. I think for this product that balance has been met fairly well and I believe that the product will meet the expectations of most buyers.

With regard to the fit and finish of this particular product, I believe it to be about average for the products of similar make or style. That is to say that it is not of poor or moderate craftsmanship/finish nor is it something that I would rate as outstanding. The quality of the piece is such that I feel it is a good value for the money.

Finally, as with many products of this type, the value that a consumer sees is dependent on the expectation. When I ordered this product my expectations were moderate, especially because of the price. In an age where we demand low price but often want high quality, it is often best if we expect moderate to good quality instead. I did that with this product as was pleasantly surprised to find that the quality was at least good, if not just a tad bit better than good. For that reason, and those set out above, I'd make a recommendation to buy this product.",5.0,0

"""The Grand"" starts off with a bunch of guys running around in a bunch of cars, and one guy is basically a burly guy, and the other guy is a hairy guy, and that guy is a little freaky.  The story is pretty simple, and it starts off pretty well.  The characters are mostly the same, except the last guy is a guy that has a gun and is doing a lot of bad things, and they get shot up.

"Our two labs roam our acreage doing their rabbit/mouse/fieldrat routine every day, come rain or shine no matter what the season.  They often came home in the summer afternoon covered in several types of burrs, fescue seed, mud covered noses, dirty faces, and tongues hanging out the sides.

But of course, they've brought home several kinds of ticks who had free loaded back to the homestead.  Going over every inch of their ""happy to see you, dad, I had fun"" bodies was a nightly ritual.  I say WAS because we then discovered the Preventic tick collars.

These collars are the greatest invention since the riding lawn mower!  Now the only ticks we see are the live ones crawling on top of their fur looking for just the right place to bite.  If one does happen to attach, it will be dead within 24 hours.

These collars last 90 days before they need to be replaced.  We put them on the dogs at the first of May when the first ticks appear (although I think the little suckers can crawl at -10 degrees on top of inch thick ice!) and then again at the first of August.  This application keeps the grinning duo tick free and both their lives and our lives much happier.  But I feel they kinda miss the attention of daddy tick hunting their bodies every day.

The dogs have never had the slightest skin irritation due to the collars but we don't but them on extremely tight.  I can still get four fingers under them.  The other nice thing about the collars is that if for some reason they get their collars caught in a fence or a limb, they are easily stretched so the dogs can get themselves loose without choking .  We've had one collar lost only once in the four years we've used the collars and although expensive to lose a collar, well worth knowing the dog wasn't hurt.",5.0,0

The reason I love this show so much is because I watched it with my grandfather during its original NBC run back in the 70's. My ""Pappy"" was a veteran (6th Marine Division) of the fighting in the South Pacific and watching Baa Baa Black Sheep would always prompt him to share some of his war stories with me. As a historian, I must criticize this program for its distorted view of the real VMF-214 but as the grandson, I love this show because it will always remind me of my now deceased ""Pappy.",4.0,0

"It is very, very small. It's a great concept, but it does not work for large, active dogs. The Velcro will not hold up to roughhousing, and if you loose your tags, you're screwed.

I ended up putting this on my cat and putting his rabies tag in it since he is an outdoor/indoor cat. He doesn't wander off, but instead of having to go thru the hassle to send it back, I just decided to put it on him.

Back to looking for more solutions, and it sucks because I bought 2 brand new tags for my dog so I could put them in this pouch. I just didn't realize it was going to be so small. It's almost the size of two postage stamps laid top to bottom.

"My standards for movies are relatively simple - the plot has to engage me to the end without offending my intellect or my spiritual understanding of the world, the storyline should have redemptive value, and the action and script should be believable and appropriate to the situation portrayed. This movie sits on my shelf because it fits all these categories.
It's the story of a kidnapping, but it revolves around the person left behind - and here lies it's strength. Even though I am no great fan of Meg Ryan, her intensity and anguish were believable and moving. Russell Crowe is (as usual) excellent at defining a character in thin lines of nuance while David Norse was achingly fragile and volatile.
Its rare to find a film that doesn't deserve it's R rating. I think this is one of them. The language and violence in this film are wholly appropriate to the subject matter, and thankfully, all other offensive content was cut during the editing process.

"I have two miniature pinchers who will be 2 YO in Sept 2014.  I got them in December of 2012; they were about 12 weeks.  That first Winter one of the pups had a bad back knee that tended to go out when she put pressure on it. When it did it obviously hurt, since she gave out a yelp..  So, she decided to stop climbing stairs.  Thinking she might need ACL surgery, I took her to a vet well known for that.  He said, nope not her ligament: bad joint (thin collagen). And he said it was a breed characteristic.  He prescribed this supplement.  Took care of it pretty quick and soon she was bounding up and down the stairs, jumping on and off the sofa and when she was tall enough, my bed.  Since the vet said bad knees are a breed characteristic, I have both dogs on a half pill a day.  The pain went away fairly quick, maybe a couple of weeks.  I keep them on it hoping to stave off arthritis in their later years.  And, best of all, they think it is a treat!  UPDATE:  As of Jan 2015 both girls no longer pups are still doing great.  They think this is a treat when they come back in the house. I still give them each half a pill/day.",5.0,0

Of all of them, Greenies are his favorites.  They're also the cheapest.

The size of these are a little larger than the Greenies.  They're also pretty cheap on Amazon compared to a local pet store.  They do seem a little tougher than the other dental chews.  All of the other ones seem a bit softer, but these are a bit rough and harder.  One thing that we liked about them is that they are wheat free and gluten free.  Our dog seems to like them.

We try to mix it up and give him different treats throughout the week.  These are a good treat to throw in the mix if you'd like to do that.  They're no Greenies, but if it will keep our little guy healthier a little longer, then we'll continue to give him these and spoil him at the same time.",5.0,0
"Received this saw yesterday and it has been working very well. I have a small shop and am a big fan of the saw, so I bought the saw to replace a 4-inch saw that had no sockets in the end. The saw is very compact and has a lot of power. I have a large shop and am very happy with it. It has great power and is great for most tasks. I am very pleased with it. This is a great tool for small jobs. It works well for smaller jobs. I'm not sure how long it will last but it does have a long life. It's a good tool. This is a very good lamp. I like it and the color is nice. It is bright and bright. I have it mounted on a 3/4 inch tree and it is pretty sturdy. I would recommend this to anyone. My only complaint is the mounting hardware is a little difficult to use. I used this as a small light and it is good. I was very disappointed with the price of this light. I received it on a discount. I plan to buy another one as a backup. This is a very nice tool. I was looking for a tool that could fit my old saw and it's a great tool.

"This kit comes with everything you need to polish metal. I took the guards and grinding wheels off an old 6"" grinder I had. I installed the buffing wheels and had the machine buffing parts in only a few minutes.

It comes with roughing blocks for course, fine, and extra fine. I didn't notice a brown block since it looked like I got two grey blocks; not a big deal for me since the three grits do exactly what I need. If you are doing jewelry, then you need the extra fine that this kit provides, but the fine will be enough to finish most general polishing. Because there are three different grades of roughing blocks, the kit also comes with three different grades of buffing wheels. You need these to keep from mixing the grits of the roughing blocks onto the same wheels.

The instruction manual is clear on how to use the kit and to get a good polish. It also shows which roughing grades to use on which metals.

So far I have polished about 23 steel, brass, and iron parts with great results. I also buffed plastic parts; one of which were the plastic headlights on a car. This kit had them looking almost new.

I am very happy with this kit and glad I didn't spend the money to buy the items separately.

UPDATE: Its been 1.5 years since I started using this kit. I have used it so much that the wheels now need to be replaced and I need more roughing blocks. So, I just bought another one of these kits on sale since it was cheaper than buying all the parts separately. I have buffed so many things that I wonder how I ever got along without it before.

"Works well with most Z-Wave home automation systems; I'm using this with Vera. The lock itself is solidly constructed and can hold up to a lot of use. The drive system has enough torque to operate the lock when used on ill-fitting doors, hasty installations, or when the door is being pushed while opening or locking. The keypad is easily visible in all kinds of light. Battery life is excellent. Has decent enough range to be used a good distance away from the home automation device or other Z-Wave devices without needing a repeater, so it works well for back doors or doors on different stories of the house. Comes with high-strength hardware that will require slight reworking of the door jamb in order to use, but is worth it.

"OK, good air combat scenes. That's out of the way now.

There is no discernible story worth caring about and NONE of the actors roused me to root for or care about them. The movie just goes on insufferably from one disconnected, disjointed scene to the next.

There is no structure to this film other than a loose stream of scenes and unattractive people, especially Sgt. Yu who's supposed to be so hot everybody wants her. She's sullen, somber, withdrawn, sour, and even that is limp and lame.

Occasionally inspired cinematography, some nice little shots, small vignettes, nothing any film school grad should not be able to do.

I'm out of stuff to write about. NOTHING here. NOTHING going on. I turned it off at 48 minutes.

In fairness, in reading the other reviews, it seems Asian fans and others got a lot more out of it than I did, so maybe it's cultural. OK, so I'm old school, USA---REALLY Old School.

"I'm going to start this review with an honest confession: if I needed a wet/dry vac on a regular basis, I would probably rate this product much lower. But, I don't need one very often - consequently, this style is ideal and rates a four star as related to my needs.

1) It doesn't take up a lot of space. Because it just snaps onto the top of a bucket, there is no need to store a full apparatus. This simply stays in a plastic tub with several other resources, ready to be pulled out.
2) The needed bucket is a very commonplace one. You're not going to get this and be annoyed because you don't have just the right bucket - unless, of course, the bucket you own is a rather odd one in the first place.
3) It's very easy to use, Just snap the motor onto the bucket, put the hose in place, and you're ready to go.
4) The suction is good. Strong enough to suck a wet spot dry.

So, are there negatives? Yes, even for my usage, there are a few negatives to this product.
1) The power cord is short. Either pull out an extension cord, or deal with limited access. The hose is also short, but that's only relevant if you have issues getting the bucket close enough to the mess needing to be cleaned up.
2) The hose needs to be attached before the motor is connected to the bucket. Not because that's order of operations, but because the two openings are not labeled.
3) They dry vac bag is rather small. Since this is considered useful for sucking debris that's a little too large for a normal vacuum, the collection bag could be a bit bigger.

I can think of several past household situations - leaks, washer issues, plumbing problems, etc. - when this would have been a handy tool. Not enough to need a full-fledged wet vac, but enough that something like this would have been worth having around.",4.0,0

"This movie is as funny as parts of the other 2 at times but i wouldnt say its as good. It has some funny moments but also some very stupid non funny moments. The other 2 movies were pretty funny throughout the whole movie and this one has hits and misses. There were parts i was laughing till i almost cried and other parts that were not funny at all. This one has more parodys of sci fi movies mainly and 8 mile. The last 2 focused more on horror. Here they parody the movie signs , the ring and 8 mile. The last 2 films had more movie parodys of all diffrent horror films and this film has popular culture parodys and sci fi. If your a fan of the first two , get this one to complete the trilogy and if you havnt seen the others or just thought they were so so rent this. Youll get a couple good laughs. Also i don't agree with the reviews that say the only funny parts are in the movie commercials they showed. All the funny parts i saw were not in the commercials and the one from the commercial ( the Micheal Jackson part) wasn't that funny and that wasn't really Micheal Jackson, it was a micheal jackson imitator.

"I have been using the Intermatic EI600 switch. It has worked great, varying the on/off times according to seasonal latitude. It is roughly accurate, shortening on time in the summer, and lengthening in the winter. Since my older home does not have a third wire to power the memory, I would have to replace the included battery every few years and have to re-program every time. I found this programming to be unintuitive and time-consuming. The newer EJ600 has a rechargeable battery so you do not face this onerous task.

Now we have the Philips 429746 CFL 900 lumen sensor light (about 60W equivalent incandescent). Simplicity itself: on when it is night or very dark overcast, on when it is dawn.
There has been NO flicker even though there is a very bright light within sight on a neighbors porch. This had been a bane when I tried screw-in sensors.

Advantages:
-simplicity
-not fooled by most bright artificial light
-sensor direction has not been critical
-lower profile than one of those sensor-equipped sockets you screw a regular bulb into. It will fit inside virtually any glass enclosure.
-my glass enclosures are a fairly dark amber, and this has not fooled the sensor
-no need for smart switches or timers.

Disadvantage:
-not LED.
-sometimes there is an on-off flickering at dusk for a minute, but rarely longer.

I have removed my 3 Intermatic switches and just leave the switches turned on. I presume it draws minimal electricity, just enough to power the sensor.

One bit of silliness: Philips rates bulb at 7 years life and adds  Life based on average usage of 3 hours per day.  So you can count on 14 years of life if you use this in the summer in",5.0,0

"I thought this was one of the worst films I have ever seen. It was painful to watch this child being bullied by her drunken father. She had no one to go to and had to eat dog food to survive. The scenes where she was having to try to cook her own dog food and gravy dinner, light a stove with a blow torch and within moments it all explodes. She runs for cover and fear, not just from the fire, but the wrath of her father...she hides in a cardboard box. The fire is all around her and one waits for her to be consumed by the smoke and flames. Suddenly her father appears and chases her out. They race through the swamp, she in terror he in a drunken anger. The scenes of all the drunkeness from the men and women and the wildness of the children...I did not find to be anything but painful. The flooding of the Bathtub area was sad and the hundreds of animals drowned was a reminder of how horrific this storm was. How little help was given left me wondering. They tried to give help but the people did not want to leave what they had...I understand that, but I did not find this to be all that great a film. I guess the father taught the daughter how to survive, and as he was dying it was evident he did love her, but it left me wondering about her future. I have been orphaned, abandoned, homeless, and terrified, but I lived in a major city and had three jobs at one time to try to survive. I guess it is a city person trying to understand a backwoods-swamp existence. The hopelessness was not to my liking.

We knew we needed to help him learn quickly so that he doesn't accidentally hurt himself or someone when he gets excited.  He's ten months old now and 120 pounds.  This collar has features that I really appreciate.  It has a vibrate and a beep as well as the shock feature.  I've actually only used the shock once and that was when he got out and was running around in the road.  I tried snacks, toys and everything else I could think of.  I was terrified he was going to run in front of a car so after the beep and vibrate didn't work, I used a very light shock.  It scared him and he ran inside.  You can pick the intensity that is used.  I just used a 2.  For other issues, like his crazy barking, we use a beep.  That usually gets him to stop, if he doesn't we use the vibrate feature.  I have the vibrate turned up because he doesn't like it and he knows he needs to stop if he gets buzzed.  The beep works great as an attention getter.  He knows when he hears it that he needs to look at us to see what he needs to do.  I'm very happy that we bought this.  I was completely against a ""shock collar,"" but we really just use the other features on it for training purposes and with some patience and persistence, it has really worked.",5.0,0

The first BIG downer, was when Lucy was repeatedly kicked in the stomach by a drug czars henchmen, when they knew the very expensive drugs where inside her belly; REALLY?  The next blunder was on the part of the so-called visual effects people (there were a few of them to blame), when they used the old roll the room effect that is so old and lame, that nobody uses it anymore.

I found the effects (or the lack of) the most offensive part of the movie, especially the growing black computer fingers; REALLY?

"I have been an organic apple cider vinegar user for a couple decades now. What started me on it was talking to someone one day about how they would drink a tablespoon of it daily for a chronic heartburn issue. Well, that is all I had to hear to try it. Next time I went shopping I bought some with the mother in it. I am one of the crazy sorts that enjoy it straight up. LOL. However, I do add it to water most days. I can't imagine not having it on hand so when I was offered this, I figured it would be great to try since I've only used Bragg's in the past.

The reason for the 4 stars is because I have not found what I feel to be the 'mother' in either bottle. There is some sediment but I haven't found the mother. I am also not to the bottom but when I shake a bottle of ACV the mother usually makes itself known. I'm not an expert and only have the one brand for comparison but I am used to SEEING the mother. I do not use apple cider vinegar with the mother for anything other than food-related. For household cleaning and disinfecting, I just use plain white vinegar. I feel this stuff is too good for that. One of my absolute favorite ways is in the summer with fresh cucumbers. I slice up cucumbers and onions and put them in a bowl with ACV, water, salt & pepper. Let that sit in the fridge and yummo. I always make my own salad dressing with it as well. I received this product at a discount for my evaluation and honest review.",4.0,0

"This Kohree actually is perfect for under my cabinets. My kitchen just happens to be centered in the house due to an old addition. The setup makes it rather dark. Years ago we had some lighting installed, but it ran rather hot. Every now and then, wed burn the tops of our hands or arms when reaching for something. The nice thing about LED lighting of all kinds is that its totally efficient and doesnt run hot.

There at ten LED lights / chips in this strip that emanate quite a bit of light when in that motion-sensing mode. If there is light in the room the Kohree won't go on and enters into an energy-saving mode. It can be used in many places and can be installed permanently by its adhesive strip if you so desire. I do like to move these around so Ive yet to install any light such as this one.

The motion-sensing ability is excellent and quite sensitive, something I do like to see. The Kohree is rather like a torch or flashlight and is approximately 1-3/16 (W) x 7-1/2 (L) x 5/8 (D). I find it rather easy to hold in my hand and Ive actually placed it in one of those hard-to-reach places under my desk so I can check out my tower. The light is quite bright and works well to light up a small area.

The Kohree takes three AAA batteries (not included), but theyll last a long time. Regardless of how long your batteries last, the LED chips should last about 50,000 hours. The technology is amazing and makes it so much easier (and less expensive) to provide small lighting sources in the home. Love this little light!

FEATURES:

 High-Efficiency, LED technology is applied.
 High bright, low power consumption, long operating life, energy saving.
 Suitable for the stairway, cabinet, closet, wardrobe, corridor, workshop, basement, garage, oil depots, roof, door, garage entrances and other places.
 Auto switching on when detecting people coming
 Operating temp :-20C-45C.

"Matt Reeves, director of Cloverfield, surprisingly does a great job at remaking a movie that has just come out a year ago on dvd. I truly enjoyed the film even though I saw original. I really like both of these little actors. I can see great things in both of their futures, especially Chloe =) Anyway I saw someone say if you haven't seen original then your not missing anything and that this one suffice. I agree with that person and would surprisingly say just watch this one. I enjoyed it a little more than the original to be quite honest. I will definitely be adding this to the collection soon. A good eerie, slow, wonderfully composed, thriller with a different outlook on vampires and children who get bullied. I suggest this to many. I hope I've been helpful.",5.0,0

"My 5 dogs and 3 puppies all would not eat this & the usually love everything!! My daughter' dog got sick when she mixed it 50/50

We raise Goldendoodles, and I had HIGH hopes that my puppies would love this as I've been researching high quality dog foods.... well it doesn't matter how high the quality is supposed to be if the puppies/dogs won't eat it! NONE of my 5 adult dogs or 12 puppies ages 2-8 month old puppies would eat it straight. I've been having to mix in meat drippings to get them to eat any of it and it caused SEVERE digestive upsets in ALL my dogs! Also when I bought mine (it was on sale) I told my daughter to try it for her dog & she had the same problem, she was mixing it 50/50 with his regular food and where he normally ate 1 bowl a day, his bowl sat for 3 days and still had kibble in it and he also had an upset stomach from the little he ate and she was up cleaning his ""accidents"" and this dog that had never had one, had several in the middle  of the night !! If this was any good (*& my dogs liked it) I was going to order 20 bags at the sale price of 2/3 off! But now I know why it was so heavily discounted. The dogs won't eat it and it makes them sick! My dogs are Goldendoodles that my son raises hers is a small Havanese that can dehydrate quickly so 3 days of  severe GI problems  trying to introduce a new food was about the limit for her.

"Listen - we know we are not alone when we say reality TV has hi-jacked network and cable television and most of it isn't really a positive force in life with its usual focus being on the nastier side of the human condition (fighting, jealousy, lying, cheating, etc. etc.) and at some point we have simply given up - so what to do after?  We became our own T.V. station!

We stopped paying the cable company hundreds and hundreds of dollars for programming we don't like (because complaining about modern television is about as helpful as peeing up hill) and we channeled that money into DVD/Blu Ray purchases of shows we know we love and this one was one the list!

Green Acres is the story of a New York lawyer who has always dreamed of owning/operating a farm - a true pioneer in the 'Back to the Land' movement (John Denver would have been proud).  But not everything is what it seems when Mr. Haney sells him a piece of useless land, a broken down house, an 'antique' tractor, and everything else one might need.  When Mr. Douglas seems too starry eyed and naive to notice his high society wife is only too happy to point out the problems.  What happens next is anyone's guess in this zany half hour comedy which we can't seem to stop watching  (even our teen daughter).

"I bought the PIF00 primary kit and the extra transmitter for my Shepard. I bought the extra transmitter due to the large yard.
The items (other than the test light) themselves appeared to be quality construction.
When I started putting out the flags, using the test light was hit or miss.  I'd plant a flag then move back and start heading outward again 10 to the side.  In some places the circumference was ok.  On others, it wasn't equidistant from the main unit (I started with the single main unit).  So, when the circle was done, I had a semi circle of flags with some at a different radius than others.  While that would have been ok - the dog would just have a non perfect circle...  However, when I went back to check again, the test light lit up at different radii than the original layout.  Basically, the dog might get zapped at a location today where he was fine yesterday.  Not something I'm willing to risk.
The test light has 2 thin wire contacts that started to bend and in my opinion would eventually break.  I had to wiggle the test light on the collar's contacts to make sure they touched.

"This is a charming movie with a great soundtrack and superb acting by Mel Gibson and Marisa Tomei.  Gibson reaches a peak of comedic genius in the movie, playing funny and compassionate moments with equal skill.  Although the movie's premise is rather absurd--a man who can hear women's thoughts after accidentally electrocuting himself in the bathroom--the viewer suspends disbelief and is drawn into the plot.  Marisa Tomei is hilarious as the ditzy coffee shop girl.  Delta Burke and Valerie Perrine, as well as Bette Midler, all have minor roles and are great in them.  Mark Feuerstein as Gibson's buddy is also excellent.  Some of the funny lines get a laugh from me every single time I watch (e.g., ""The poodle give you that one?"").  I loved the music, which included songs by Frank Sinatra, Bobby Darin, Cole Porter, and more.  This is a romantic comedy, and although I find it hard to see Helen Hunt as a vulnerable, romantic leading lady--I think of her more as the sardonic character in ""Mad About You""--I thought she acted well in the movie and even worked in some ""cupcake""-type moves.  This is a DVD whose extra features are worth watching, particularly director Nancy Meyers' comments on how the movie was made.  This movie is a keeper that marries the modern dilemmas of romance with the feel of romantic comedies from the 40s and 50s.  Mel Gibson's dance scene and the scene where he waxes his leg are outstanding, and he is entirely believable as the chauvinistic playboy who is shocked at what women think.

I knew I needed a bigger filter and as soon as I realized the Ecco was self-priming, I was sold.

Some key differences between the Ecco and the Classic:
1. The priming pump - huge key. I didn't find the plastic handle to be too flimsy, but I was also gentle with it after having read reviews. It primes so quickly and I don't have to worry about swallowing aquarium water!
2. There's only one nozzle on each tube that controls the flow rate, when on the Classic there was two. For me, this is just easier - less connections mean less possibility for leaks, and I only need one nozzle to control the flow rate anyway.
3. It is so much quieter. Maybe it's because I upgraded the size of the filter so much so it's working less, but I'm amazed that a filter so much bigger is so much quieter. It makes NO noise, it's actually incredible.

So all in all: powerful, quiet, easy to set up and easy to maintain. I'm so happy with it.",5.0,0
"I recently saw this movie on television and knew that it needed to be in my DVD library.  This film is about a bacteriologist (Edward Norton) who very quickly falls in love with a young lady (Naomi Watts), they marry, and he takes her back to China where he's stationed as a English civil servant.  She doesn't really love him when they marry and tells him that, but she looks at marrying him as a way to get out of her home and away from her mother since there aren't any other prospects for her.  In China she gets bored with him and her life there and winds up having an affair with a low level English diplomat.  I won't say any more but suffice it to say that this movie just slowly sucks you in -- the art direction, the photography, the styling -- you feel as if you're in China in the 1930's.  The acting is superb, in my opinion, because it is not-in-your-face.  Rather, it is subtle and there are moments when a glance, or smirk, or a move of the head evokes the feeling vs. words.  Naomi Watts seems perfect for the part of the wife, and Edward Norton plays the repressed, formal English man to perfection.  The supporting cast - especially Toby Jones, are also superb.  Too bad that this movie didn't garner more attention when it came out because it certainly deserves a viewing.  It's a different kind of love story with no violence, no naked bodies, no CGI graphics, no swearing, no car/motorcycle/truck action shots -- that explains why it probably didn't make $300 billion dollars at the box office.  Oh well....",5.0,0

"I am a first time owner. I read that it is best to feed a puppy higher quality foods instead of the big commercial brands.  After reading a lot of positive reviews, I decided to try Wellness Super5 for Puppies. Worst mistake I ever made.  My little bully's stool was never firm.  It did however make his coat very shiny. But he developed a very bad case of diarrhea. He stopped eating and drinking for a day.  I was so worried about the lil guy. After an overnight stay (& a very expensive vet bill), my lil bully returned home full of energy.  The vet recommened that he would have to eat canned Purina EN for the rest of his life.  Realizing that they really just wanted my money, I decided to switch his food.  I decided to go with Canadae ALS. During the transition, BlackJack was still having a loose stool. After more research, I finally decided on Cal Natural Lamb & Rice. I started mixing this food and BJ developed a very bad bloody diarrhea case.  I started the ""at home remedy"" of pepto bismol and a bland diet.  The pet store clerk recommended some canned pumpkin as well.  BJ fasted for 24 hours.  After feeding him boiled chicken & rice for a few days, the blood gradually disappeared. I slowly started mixing the Cal Natural Lamb & Rice. All i can say is BJ is feeling 100% better and his stool is solid!!!  This was the result I wanted with Wellness, but I was very disappointed.

"This is a good dog-seat solution.

PROS: My 11 pound mini pinscher fits perfectly into it - it is big enough for her to lie down too. The seat can be hung high enough for her to look out the window, or set low (almost on the car seat) for extra stability. The fact that the upper straps are attached to the frame halfway along the side walls and not at the very front means that the full space of the box is available to the dog (i.e. the front wall doesn't cave in).  The clip attaches to the god collar or harness and is adjustable in length. The cover is removable and washable.

CONS: the frame is metal and the cover very thin, so there is no padding whatsoever if the dog falls against the side of the box or wants to rest her head on the rim. For some strange reason the short strap that clips onto the dog collar/harness is not looped in/permanently attached, i.e. if you try lengthen that strap to the maximum to give your dog more freedom of movement it simply comes out and you have to maneuver it back in. It also came with a HUGE (and I mean huge) clip for attaching to the dog collar/harness, so i had to replace it with a smaller one.

TIP: The floor does occasionally tip back, especially if the car seatback to which it is attached is tilted back slightly. The more upright you make the back of the car seat, the better the box hangs horizontally.",4.0,0

I've had my BDF for the past eight+ years, and I'm convinced the use of these filters and adding the vinegar, have kept the BDF running without a problem this long.

"Alien Nation isn't just a sci-fi show masquerading as a cop show.  It's equal & intelligent measures of both and reminds the viewer what can be accomplished when serious treatment of science fiction is presented to a mainstream audience.

Too often Sci-Fi gets a ""cult"" label - something only Star Trek or Star Wars people should watch or love.  However, when you look at the lists of the most profitable movies of all time, you find many science fiction titles - E.T. The Extraterrestrial, Terminator 2: Judgement Day and of course the Star Wars films.  If so many people are going to see these movies, then how can one justify the ""cult"" label?  To be fair, there is much sci-fi that isn't done well, however when it's a focused production like Alien Nation, audiences are treated to quality, intelligent entertainment with more than just car chases and gun fights.

"The music is, as expected, brilliant.  The sets and cinematography are magnificient.  Adrien Brody, as usual, puts in an excellent performance---he has probably the most expressive eyes in cinema.  The script is also solid, few dead spots anywhere.
What keeps this from being a *great* film, however, is Roman Polanski's lack of discipline as a director, or apparently the lack of strong producers willing to trim off all the fat---and boy is there ever lots of fat!  At 2-1/2 hours, this film actually felt twice as long as ""Schindler's List"" which is over 3 hours and covers a much wider scope!  It takes forever to depict a few simple scenes (for example, a starving Brody trying to open a can of cucumbers) and characters (such as Brody's family during the Nazi takeover of Warsaw).  I get the impression that Polanski was given this free hand out of ""sensitivity"" rather than artistic good sense, simply because he himself was a Holocaust survivor.
The result is that unlike ""Schindler's List"" this film has almost no recognizable subtext.  It's been promoted as a ""tale of survival"" or ""one man surviving for the sake of his love of his music"" but in actuality it feels more like a very slow documentary.  Brody actually spends very little time onscreen playing the piano...the first 2/3 of the film mainly centers around the hellish life of Polish Jews herded into the Warsaw Ghetto before getting shipped off to concentration camps.  Brody's character seems less of a tenacious survivor than a bumbling, dazed butterfly---saved mainly by one fortuitous turn of events after another rather than any Herculean personal efforts.
Due to the bloated pacing and relatively passive central character, ""The Pianist"" lacks any clear focus and never develops any consistent momentum.  The viewer, like Brody's character, just sits there waiting for it all to end---we WATCH things happpening, but are never made a PART of them.",3.0,0

"Love the saw.  Does a great job at a reasonable price.

My only issue is the manual, and it's probably not the manufacturer's fault.  It's the lawyers.  With this litigious society we live in, you can no longer get a manual that tells you what to do and how to do it.  It's always a long laundry list of warnings and cautions.  Due to this, it's nearly impossible to search through the manual on how to actually do something, because that useful tidbit was wedged between the warning about using the saw on a fluorescent tubes and the caution against hand-holding it to cut down tree branches.

I'm pretty sure that if all the lawyer-speak was removed, the instructions would fit on a single sheet of paper.

I've discovered that if I set the blade bevel at 45 degrees, if I were to actually turn it on and bring the blade down, it would shred the aqua-colored plastic table inserts at the center of the cutting surface.  I've spent a long time searching through the manual about this.  Is there another adjustment?  Do these inserts need to be removed before cutting a bevel?

Edit:  It turns out I had a defective unit.  I exchanged it and the bevel on the new one works fine.",4.0,0

"I was looking for a pair of cheap, basic lamps, and while looking through lamp designs I didn't like at all trying to find something that I liked, this lamp popped up in the related items.

I instantly knew this was the lamp. I was going for an Asian/Zen theme for my living room and while I had decided on plain lamps due to budgetary reasons, these fit the theme almost perfectly. Reading reviews, I ordered two and hoped I would receive an unbroken/uncrushed one.

When they arrived they were packed well inside their boxes. Form-fitting foam and plastic bags/wrap around the base and shade. Both lamps were intact. The shades were also uncrushed, but I accidentally put a small ding in both as I was unwrapping the plastic from them (they're kind of a plasticky paper that once dented will retain a visible crease line even if the dent is popped back out.) Fortunately the creases are small, and not really noticeable and I put them towards the back anyway.

The lamps were slightly smaller than I thought, but I'm not disappointed in them. The very bottom of each ""stone"" is indeed unpainted/unglazed, but it's not visible unless you look at it from below. I can also confirm what another reviewer said. These use regular bulbs, not candelabra bulbs, So if the listing is still recommending them, ignore it. The instructions list a 40-watt as the intended bulb, but since heat isn't an issue with LEDs, I've got a 60-watt equivalent in the lamps.

Also, the listing says the color is black and grey. This is wrong. They're dark grey and light grey. I wish these were available in black and dark grey, which would fit the Zen theme even better. I've thought about repainting them as such, but I'd have to sand off the current glaze, repaint them, then gloss coat them. That's more trouble and cost than I want to go through for these lamps. So I'm just using them as-is.",4.0,0

"I bought this an an everyday carry light to keep in my pocket. This flashlight fills that role nicely. 120 lumens is plenty of light for walking down a dark alley, or finding items in my car at night, it is even bright enough to use as a tactical flashlight for close range use. Full power mode will allow you to see quite well at 25 yards while medium power in excellent for situations where you don't need 120 lumens, such as walking the dog. Low power mode is excellent for tasks such as unlocking a door or reading. I could live without the strobe as I don't have much use for it.

The ergonomics of this light are well thought out. The checkering allows for a secure grip, but it isn't abrasive. Furthermore the tactical style bezel is rounded out enough to avoid abrasions and scrapes to the user while being aggressive enough to get the job done. Perhaps the best feature is the power switch, as it is well thought out. Press the button slightly for momentary on and press the button until it clicks for constant on. Once the light is in constant on mode, a half press of the button will switch to medium power, another half press for reading mode, and yet another held press for strobe. When the light is turned off, it will reset to full power the next time the light is turned on.

Perhaps my only complaint (a small one at that) is that the light makes a high pitched whine when on medium power mode. This is only noticeable when the light is near your ear.

Overall, I would recommend this light for everyday carry use because it is well thought out, built with quality, and above all else it is reliable.",5.0,0

"Max finally killed Captain Kurklops. The last of his stuffing was in my hallway when I came home yesterday. He now happily carries around the rag wherever he goes.

This and Polly pig were his first set of Tuffy brand toys. Polly pig is still going strong a month later, minus one of her ears.

When we first got this toy, Max, an 8 month old pit puppy, managed to rip both of them within the first 10 minutes. However, after the initial tears, he managed to slow down with the toy destruction.

Kurklops has a body squeaker and one at the tip of each tentacle. Max ripped the squeakers out of each tentacle before working on the body. What is nice is that each limb is a separate stitched compartment so that by ripping out the stuffing in one part of the toy, he isn't able to take out all the stuffing in one shot.

This toy is NOT meant for a serious game of tug of war. It's my dog's favorite game and he tore off a tentacle during our first and only game of tug. However its perfectly suited for indoor games of catch.",4.0,0

The product seems well made, but again I've only used it once. I was torn between ordering a s/m verses a med. She is currently 30 pounds and has a petite build. I ended up purchasing the medium.

"Let's cut to the important part - this product works, and works well.  The litter stays perfectly clean and raked, and I only need to empty the waste bin (easy when you use a grocery bag as a liner) once a week or so.

That's the good part.  The bad part is it's been relentlessly unreliable.  It will jam if you put even slightly too much litter in it.  I've had burned out motors, squeaky conveyors, and busted sensors.  I've disassembled and reassembled it countless times.  That being said, it's a simple machine, and some basic mechanical inclination will allow one to service this accordingly.

My first unit was missing a few minor, non-critical parts, and the motor burned out after a month or so, making a squealing noise from day one that made my cat afraid to use it.  I had disassembled, lubricated, and reassembled multiple times.

I contacted PetSafe, which was awesome.  They sent me an entirely new unit without asking me to return the old unit, so I officially had a new one with an old one for parts.  Since replacing the unit with the new one, it's still been slightly finnicky, but notably better than the old one.  I've still had to make a few repairs, but again, for someone with basical mechanical aptitude, it's not hard.

So yes, it's been less than reliable, but my wife and I love it, and we can't imagine going back to scooping again.  I'd have to say, if this replacement one fails, I'll be happy to replace it with the same unit.",4.0,0

"After viewing these 4 films once again, I realize how important some twentieth century films are to our understanding of ourselves, our religons, the way we love one another, and the way we deal with death. The artistry is within every frame. There is one interview documentry with Bergman in 1998 with one of his assocites, it is clear that as Bergman got older and older, he wanted to dis-associate himself from these early acheivements. Why? He states that although he knew he was master of the medium (and theater as well)that his personal life, was just a series of bitter disappointments ending with the death of his last wife, Ingrid I beleive. So, he assumed himself to be just an anonymous technician, or at least that's what he wished. The only compliant I have is that the subtitles are inside of the visual image instead of being letter boxed and the subtitles are sloppily inserted. Not up to Criterion criteria. One new observation is that the ensamble cast that Bergman uses throughout most of these films are one of the reasons these movies are the classics that they are. Lastly, Bergman films aren't made to be watched once and discarded, they are made to be re-inestigated year-in and year-out.",5.0,0

"It's funny how one goes through life without having an item that when you finally get it, you wonder how in the world you lived without it! Well, that's how it is with a block plane. Being somewhat of a power tool snob, I normally don't turn to hand tools when working a project. I saw a relevant YouTube video extolling the virtues of hand planes and noticed that the master woodworker's wall was filled with planes of all sizes and shapes. It got me to wondering what I was missing. I already had a #4 plane squirreled away in my work bench, but this master craftsman convinced me that I needed a block plane. So I got this one.
Once it arrived, I did the standard ""tune up"" by getting the packing coatings removed, adjusting the blade, and sort of checking the flatness of the shoe. All was well.
I had a project going at the time with several half-lap joints where the ends extended a little proud beyond the edge. End grain! Yikes! That's not going to machine well. And I want to use a 1/4"" round over bit with my router, but before I can do that, I need to take that end grain protrusion down to flush with the other surface. Block plane to the rescue! A few quick swipes with a very light cut and it looked perfect with no breakout on the grain. I am a happy camper. I also picked up a stone and honing guide, since now I'll be using my planes a lot more. Next step is to get a few diamond honing stones in finer grits and get really serious about having insanely sharp tools.",5.0,0

I don't make a living pulling cables but I have, at times, helped installers run network and power cables at home and the office. So I do have some exposure to expensive brands of fish rods. I am putting in a home theater system with a projector in my daughter's playroom and I decided to do-it-myself as a bit of weekend therapy. Now, knowing I was going to use the rods only a few times I did not want to spend more than was necessary. So these rods seemed to fit the bill and I figured I could return them if they were really bad. I imagine I'm a fairly typical user of this product in that you buy it for one or two projucts and that's it. A professional would not find these durable enough for daily use.

Yes, they are a little thin but I was only putting cables into mostly internal wall spaces and not needing to run them over and around complicated obstacles. Unless of course you count insulation and AC wiring cables!  I found no problem with the brass ferrules and not once did I have any issue with the ends breaking off but remember I was only using them for a day. It might have been helpful if they were a little thicker pushing by insulation but it really wasn't that bad. Once the extra  flexibility was really helpful. I was using only two or three at a time.

It was certainly a highly entertaining show with no end to the action.  It contains murder, espionage, terrorism, traitors, kidnapping and a presidential assassination plot.  And that is all in one day.

The concept of the show is that each episode represents one hour of a day in real time.  The hero, federal anti terrorist agent Jack Bauer, encounters more action in two hours than any 50 average people do in their entire lives.

The kit itself looked very nice with the orange/grey paracord, but I will admit I hated to take it apart because I figured I couldn't put it back together.  However, I got this for a product review so I proceeded to take it apart.

I paid attention to the steps I took, even taking pictures, and slowly took the kit apart.  I dumped out the contents, and everything seemed to be there - a pretty neat little kit of various items.  The flashlight has a piece of plastic on the battery, once you remove that it works fine.

To my own surprised, I was actually able to put the full kit together - it didn't look as nice as it did when I got it, but still looked pretty good.  Overall this is a neat little kit that would be a great novelty gift, and could actually come in handy depending on the person.

"The single DVD version with the concept of the ""probes"" being sent from a future human race was a very upbeat and inovative plot device for this vision of Earth-after-man. That is what we all saw on the Animal Planet version of this show. Each of the ages was treated the same in the full length episodes as they were in the introductery condenced one hour form. They added probes and the omnipresent narrarator to guide us through each hour. I was enthralled with the whole weird thing! Completely swept away!
So,when I got this collection of British talking heads beaming at how smart they all were to have theorised all these creatures out of nothing but thin air-headedness,I was disenchanted at best. They all came off as arrogant and way too self satisfied. While listening you could hear the flaws in many of the basic assumtions. The ecologies and behaiviors shown were often far too over simplified to create their ""new possibilities"". As a viewer your suspention of disbelief was completely shot! There was no way to invest your imagination in these soap bubble epocs being constantly reminded that they are just creations.

"Highlights: Terrifying scenes of suspense and building of tension; immaculate cinematography depicting lifeless England; most of the performances, principally lead Cillian Murphy's and the reliable Brendan Gleeson's; alternative ending is KILLER.
Lowpoints: Too much zombies, too little subliminal terror at times; Megan Burns as the little girl is a truly terrible performance that fortuitously doesn't bring the film down.
Conclusion: An unflinching, metaphorical look at the possible loss of control over rage amongst humans, 28 Days Later marks Danny Boyle's comeback from his flop The Beach. Petrifying with its realism and astounding in its contrastive moods, 28 Days Later definitely has more in common with the director's dark masterpiece Trainspotting - it is scary, droll and compelling, and will linger with its audience, despite its flaws, long after the ending.

"There's a lot to like about the A-Flow 5 Function Dual shower head, primarily the fact that it provides a number of different combinations and settings with solid flow (even with flow restrictors). Installation is fairly easy, directions are so so, but they include plumbers tape in the box as well as spare parts (a HUGE bonus).

It took me about 10 mins to install and get set up, once i did, I found the flow to be very solid (even with a flow restrictor on). The instructions tell you how to remove the flow restrictor, but we chose not to.

Switching between the main shower head and the extension head is pretty easy and the settings on the extension heads are as good as the main head. Of the settings, the massage mode stands out the most as it kicks out a lot of water at a high speed, pulsing quite rapidly.

The only downside of this shower head is the main connector piece that switches between the two heads is plastic and on the one I got, dripped very slightly at the switch. It's a small gripe, for an otherwise good showered.

"Money. What everyone wants. And when they get it, all they want is more. That is the basic concept behind Confidence. Jake Vig (Edward Burns) is a con man that makes his living by scamming people out of their money. Accompanied by his three buddies (Louis Lombardi, Paul Giamatti, and Brian Van Holt), the crew moves from city to city tricking people and stealing their money. But when Big Al (Louis Lombardi) turns up dead after one of the scams, they get into something they never expected. It turns out that the money they just stole belongs to someone who is referred to as simply, King (Dustin Hoffman). Vig goes to talk to the King and is hired to run a heist to get back the money for King. Edward Burns plays a smooth talking, very convincing young man... and he plays him extraordinarily. It was very refreshing to see him handle the lead role so well because he hasn't always looked comfortable with it. Dustin Hoffman also does some outstanding acting (as usual) playing a sex-crazed man with ADHD and obviously aware of how powerful and rich he is. There are numerous amounts of heist and con movies around right now, but this film tells the way people feel about money very well, while still keeping your eyes glued to the screen.

"I wanted stainless steel food dishes that sat lower than the standard locking food cups for my ferrets, for use in a Ferret Nation Cage.  By mounting the holder rings upside down, this causes the bowls to wedge into the ring tighter, and thus defeats all ferret efforts to spill the contents. They've never managed it even once, but it's still easy for me to remove the bowls for cleaning and refilling. (Because there isn't a tab on the bottom of these bowls they also sit flat on the counter!) I'm much happier with these proportions and this look. I also have two 16 oz versions in our (cat-sized) travel crate.

Additional Note- The cups that were sent by HorseLovers are Spot brand (by Ethical Products) and are actually all stainless-steel (no black coating on the ring and clamp, which has eventually rusted on other coop cups), and I like the look of this better. They have a thicker, sturdier ring with a looser fit than other coop cups I've bought, so I had to bend the rings a tiny bit toward oval so that the rim of the bowl jams tight against the metal prongs on the back of the clamp. Not a big deal at all, and worth it for stainless steel and a sturdier make. These bowls look like they'll last a long time.",5.0,0
"The Usual Suspects is one of the best movies ever made.  The characters are well drawn and the story is well-told.  There are some funny moments, but it is not that funny.  It is a good film, and one I would watch again.The series was cancelled by a network in September, and it has been cancelled again.  I think the show was canceled because the producers had to make a deal with the syndication company that syndicated it.  The syndication company is owned by the syndication company, and they want to sell the show.  They are looking for a way to get the syndication company to put the show on air, and I think that would be a good thing.  It would be nice if they would put it on air, but it would be hard to get it on air.  They would have to sell it on a weekly basis, and that would be a problem.

"A reviewer mentioned most of the movie was filmed at night. Dauh It's called a Noir cool guy. This film isn't great by any means. I honestly don't know why people luv it so much. You gut a spineless guy being bullied to death by a mean girl & also you get 2 see his woman out in Hollywood act like a B---- & tramp around in order to make it big.

Both woman in this film got no redeeming qualities what so ever. The back story behind the original lead actor is pretty crazier. Even crazier a guy named Wade Williams supposedly bought old movies. That I guess conveniently went into public domain not long after. He made some cash & re-made this film. It's nice to see someone be so passionate about a film.

I wish it had been a better 1, but the re-creation & great use of color is good. Of course their are much better noir's out their in color & don't cost 50 Dollars for a damn VHS. But hey I'm an obsessive collector. Was the film worth 50 Dollars. Heck No. Did I enjoy it. We'll yeah. It's sorta interesting seeing the lead man go from so dark. Then flash back 2 him being all happy, bossed around nice guy 2 being all hard again like Eastwood. It's quite amusing.

I honestly wish more classy noirs were made & not updated in anyway except color. It sucks I searched everywhere for a cheap bootleg hopefully on DVD. Nope, all bootlegs are of the original film. Most people hardly know this film exists.

Oh trust me it does & it's a miracle it exists at all & I do get a smile on my face knowing I'm 1 of the only people who probably owns it. I'd suggest someone buying it. But whoops.

"Plot - Rotten Tomatoes
A bunch of adults discover just how frightening the wrong kind of clown can be in this horror opus. After the girl he loves is stolen away by a thuggish gang member, a young man uses the forces of evil to bring to life Killjoy (Angel Vargas), a clown doll he owned as a child. The young man is killed before the spell can fully take effect, but Killjoy soon comes to life to wreak a horrible revenge on the people who killed his master.

Review - 2/5
When I seen how low IMDB had Killjoy rated I just had to watch it. Was it really that terrible? Well I've seen much, much worse. Yeah the characters are bad and the whole cast is virtually unknown. The camera work is amateurish and cheap. But it does have it's moments that made me laugh at times. The evil clown seems like Micheal Jackson dressed up in a costume. He has some funny one liners and would have been scarier if not for the corny script. The effects aren't the greatest but for how cheaply it was made for they do ok. This film pretty much destroyed the chance of any of the actors or director ever becoming a big name. None of them has made anything of note since. Some of them haven't even acted since. Sorry but this clown in the hood type film just didn't work. It's funny for a one time watch but that's about it. I am relectant to watch the other Killjoy films but I'm sure it can't get any worse.

"This is a movie really meant to be watched in a theatre, instead I watched it on a Kindle 10"" Fire HDX.  The visuals and CGI are superb, easily the best since the now ancient Apollo 13.  Sandra Bullock & George Clooney give good performances.  Unfortunately the story & script just don't hold up under even minor scrutiny.  Space Shuttle crews trained together for a year more before a mission, but from the start, Clooney as mission commander, appears to have only just met Bullock, who plays a scientist intent of upgrading the Hubble telescope.  Later, it's made known that Clooney doesn't know even where Bullock lives.  For me, a thread of unbelievability runs throughout the movie, which could easily have been fixed had the producers hired a genuine SST astronaut as an advisor to the script.",3.0,0

"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this LED CRLight 4W Dimmable LED Filament Candle Light Bulb,2700K Warm White 400LM, E12 Candelabra Base Lamp C35 Bullet Top, Clear Glass Cover, 40W Incandescent Replacement light!  This 4 Watt is exactly what I've been looking for and an amazing light bulb! The placement of where we use this light is in our bedroom fan light. I feel so much better knowing that we are only using much less power instead of full 40 wattage of an incandescent bulb.

I have attached several pictures for comparison between the original style light bulb and this E12 base dimmable candelabra bulb. The first picture shows the size comparison between the 40W incandescent light bulb and this 4W LED candle light bulb (practically the same size). They have the same E12 base size and these light bulbs are for light fixtures such as chandeliers, fans, etc (not for tiny night lights). The construction and quality of the light bulb is so sturdy and excellent. The other picture shows how the LED light bulb glows and puts off a ton of light. This particular bulb is a Warm White which is my favorite and preferred choice of light bulb color. Ive come to realize the Bright White bulbs look too blue for my taste and the Warm yellow looks too much like my grandmas house. So my preference is in the middle at the warm white.

I tested the dimmable feature of these light bulbs as our fans have dimmable remotes to control the light. There is no flicker in the bulb at all and looks like a normal bulb when dimming. I think having the LED light with the characteristic of being dimmable is a huge plus since our fan has a remote with a dimmer switch and it works like a charm. I like the option to dim whenever I want to. I wish I would have bought this light sooner and started saving my energy bills!

"my two cats LOVE these and i think the texture of the treat itself actually does ""brush"" their teeth some: each piece has a tight skin, like a sausage casing, so their teeth have to puncture the skin first, which i think is a great start and simulates natural tooth-cleaning textures they would find in nature. inside, the treat is dry and brittle, so as they chew, little flakes splinter apart perpendicular to the tooth surface, and i really imagine that this is as close to tooth-brushing as a treat can get. in addition to this effective texture, there are ingredients that are designed to reduce plaque enzymatically and (temporarily) increase oral pH to inhibit bacterial growth. the ingredients list for these treats is much shorter than other dental treats, and i think much more natural, safe, and healthy.

my cats get one treat each, once after breakfast and once after dinner. they both go nuts at treat time and one of them runs all the way to the other side of the apartment to eat his treat so that the other can't steal it. the only problem is that now i have to deal with them milling around the cabinet where i keep the treats.

i buy the poultry flavor because i don't like to give my cats a lot of fish, but these are a fish based treat regardless which flavor you buy, and they smell VERY fishy. i don't think there is much point in choosing a flavor, so if one is cheaper than the other or on sale then just buy the cheaper flavor.",5.0,0

I use this on my African Grey and she loves it too.  I have a large dog and she loves it.  I am using it on the shoulders of my dog and it is very comfortable.  It does not upset her collar.  I have to put it on her with no problem.  I have the collar on her and she is on it for her first time,4.0,1

This product has a flow control button and an LED bulb.  The light output is bright and the light output is very dim.  There is no light output indicator on the light switch so it is difficult to know when the light is on,4.0,1
"I was pleased to see that it was free of allergens.  My dog loves this stuff.I bought this for a friend's cat and she is a huge fan of it. It is a little hard to get on her, but it's not really heavy so it's not a problem. It's a bit heavy for her, but she's not a big chewer. I wish I would have gotten it a little bigger for her, because it's hard to get her to stop when I get it. I would have given it a 5 for her, but I didn't. She's a big chewer, so I wanted to give it a 5 because she's a little too big for it to stay on. I'm not sure if it's a problem with her weight, but it's not the only thing she enjoys. I haven't noticed any changes in her coat, but I have noticed a slight improvement in her eating habits.My cats love this food. My dog is about 20 lbs. and he was very picky about his food. I would recommend this food to anyone with a picky dog. I give it to my cat twice a day for her daily dose of treats.I was worried about the quality of this bed but it is great! I have a two year old cat who had an eye infection and needed help with her eating. I was able to get her a quality bed and she is happy with it! The materials are sturdy and the material is beautiful. I highly recommend this bed to anyone!I really like the color and it looks nice",4.0,1

"This jacket arrived weeks earlier than expected, a pleasant surprise.  It is thick, soft & warm just as described.  And it is lovely!  The size small (tag says med) I ordered fits my 4.6 lb. Chiweenie well except it is a little long on her back extending down over the base of her tail. This will not be a problem as I just tuck it under a little when she wears it outdoors and it stays tucked.  The extra length will be nice to keep her warmer when she wears this for other purposes.  I love the 3 snaps on the underside of the tummy as it makes this garment easy to put on & take off.  I also appreciate the ribbing around the sleeve openings & bottom hem as this should provide durability.  Just wish there was a leash opening at the base of the hood.  It looks darling on her & I recommend this snuggly highly.",5.0,0

"Although this is not one of Vincent Price's better ""Saturday Matinee Horror Flicks,"" like House of Wax, it is worthy of purchasing if you are a collector of Vincent Price movies. ""A Comedy of Terrors,"" with Peter Lorre and Boris Karloff, is another - and it is a definite 5 Star, at least, in my opinion.",4.0,0
