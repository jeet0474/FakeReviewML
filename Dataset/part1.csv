"Okay. I purchased 3 what I thought were different styles of arm covers, all black. Well, I got 2 Hi-cool and one something else. At least I can compare the two I bought. Hi-cool are far superior. I wear them for at least 8 hours and my arms do not mind! I am afraid of skin cancer and I am in the sun all day, so I bought these. Yes, they are bit warm, but not bad at all. They grip but not so tight you lose circulation (and I do not have skinny arms). They are so soft and comfortable. I wish I knew what the other ones were called, but I now know for a fact that Hi-Cool Rules!

06/2015-  Well, I ordered another pair and these are different. They are much thinner and seem shorter. I guess they are not all made the same. Just a heads up. The new pair is very uncomfortable because it is smaller and shorter.  Once you stretch it to fit, you can see through the fabric....hope it still protects me.  Buyer beware. All Hi-Cool are not the same.",5.0,0

"Having bought a new case, i got a whole bunch of fans to go with it.  despite them being able to be used with out a fan control, i decided to get one, because i realized that the fans can be quite loud. so i got this.
definitely worth the $20 or so i paid for it. it installed like a breeze (note that it'll fit into a slot that a normal sized CD/DVD drive would fit into).  It can control up to 5 fans and it'll vary speed and in the case of my fans brightness of the LEDs.
When the fans (5 of them) are full blast, it can get pretty loud. i usually don't turn them up to full blast unless doing something strenuous to my computer like playing games doing some data analysis of huge data sets.
overall good and worth the investment for a more customized computer. probably not very useful if you have 1 fan.",5.0,0

This silicone cake pan makes a great presentation. I made a chocolate cake and it turned out great. I have reviewed other silicone bakeware products for Amazon and have been happy with them. Clean up is super easy because almost no crumbs or residue from the cake remain in the pan. The cake did pop right out without it sticking to the inside. The instructions do say to bake with the pan placed on top of a cookie sheet. Great for a party as a way to showcase a cake.,4.0,0

"Thunderbolt transfers are ridiculously fast compared to Firewire and USB -- 10 gbps -- and are incredibly handy when working on the fly with large files. It's an excellent choice for large video, photo, and audio files. It can be daisychained, too, so you can have multiple adapters setup for one machine (ultimate efficiency and speed!).

Unfortunately, no cable is included - so this can become an expensive upgrade pretty quickly.  I used this in conjunction with a 3TB Seagate drive, and was very pleased at its utility for backing up and storing files; Thunderbolt's speed is definitely overkill for regular small backups, but is invaluable with huge files and directories. It doesn't require a Seagate hard drive, just any SATA III drive.",4.0,0

"I have another cast iron square grill from Calphalon(?) and after comparing the two I gotta say, Lodge is a lot nicer.

Some of you might be thinking ""it's just a piece of iron!"" but there are several small but key items that make this a better unit.

The metal seems nicer.  After cleaning them both, the lodge does seem shinier (if that's even possible) whereas my older unit started darkening after the first use.

Food and debris seem to come off easier with the Lodge though still a chore depending on what you cook.

The grill lines are wider and flatter than my other grill.  This makes cleaning easier and actually better grill marks on the food.

The grip at the end of the pan is also easier with the hole at the end of it.

"First, let me say the obvious; for $100 this isn't cutting edge electronics so temper your expectations accordingly.  Having said that, this is a nice little tablet for the price as long as you keep it simple.

PROS:
Crisp display and at 7"" a nice viewing area.  Steams movies well with very minimal issues.
Comes with quite a few bells and whistles (so-so camera, assortment of apps, and some nice features such as weather updates and news)
Great for reading newspapers, books, and surfing non-graphic intensive web pages.

CONS:
Virtually no storage area, buying an expansion card is almost a must
Not powerful enough to play any graphic intensive apps.  Tried playing a simple app like Simpsons Tapped Out and it's very choppy and stutters.
Not a fan of the button placement but getting used to it.

Doubles as a stand and shroud for an alcohol burner and functions great to channel the heat from a stick fire into the cooking pot.

The stainless steel has held up very well through many hot fires.

I made one slight modification by installing some rails for the pot to rest on. This got the pot up higher away from the flame for a better burn and also allowed more oxygen into the fire and around the pot.

"I bought one of these last year and it was great, little or no static or interference. This one transmits especially well. You can't go wrong for [...].
One major problem with it is the wire. Be careful with it!
When you connect it to your power outlet be careful not to pinch or pull on the wire especially if your power outlet is recessed in the dashboard. It'll become detached and you'll end up having one channel go out. You can play with it and have both channels work but eventually it'll fail totally.
Also the wire protrudes out of the left side of the unit. If you want to keep your player in your lap while driving ok but if you keep it anywhere else this will cause the wire to become pinched.
A good idea with this unit would be to plug it in vertically or sideways or even upside down so as not to pinch or pull on the wire. Make sure there's no tension on it. The looser the better. It'll last longer that way.

"I am surprised at some of the reviews that consider this a small chair.  Although it doesn't feel like a 17th-century King's throne, and although it is recommended to not be used by anyone over 225 lbs, my 6'3"" 200+ lb frame fits into this chair quite comfortable, with space on either side.

This is a comfortable chair, the lumbar support is nice, the air lift works smoothly so far, and it was fairly easy to assemble (it took me 40 minutes from start to finish).  I like that the arms tilt up if you want them out of the way... of course I didn't know this when assembling it and though something was wrong!  I should also mention the metal armrests were both labeled ""J"" (instructions called one ""I"" and one ""J"") and took me awhile to figure out which is which, genius that I am.

The upholstery is a textured brownish-grey, with the metal frame kind of somewhere between a gold/nickel color.... I would think it'd be important to know this going in if your color scheme is important.

For me, the question of whether this chair is worth the $ is its longevity.  Will the upholstery pull or tear easily?  Will the up/down mechanism last?  Etc.  If I think of it I will check in here with an update in 6 months.  One wants a chair like this to last several years, of course, so, we will see.  For now, a solid 4 stars for a major upgrade over my last office chair!",4.0,0

"It's okay, barely. You get what you pay for every time. It's good for a starter 5.1 setup but don't expect any oooos and aahhs.
I purchased the exact item from Walmart for $59.99.
The sound is okay if you use an equalizer to balance things out. Small speakers *always* mean small sound.
The four corner speakers are 8 Watts each. Don't let the ""150W"" fool you. The center speaker's qualitty reminds me of a pocket radio's speaker. It's very mid-range only and there's almost no tonal quality to voices.
The cables should be longer. I'm going to have to make extensions for my application. That's not hard since the speakers, except for the front right, are RCA. I believe a 9-pin D-SUB extension cable will work for the front right speaker but I'm not sure yet.

I emailed their customer service and same day they sent me a new one and were super friendly. Awesome customer service.
Yea, 32 bucks is pricey for a water bottle but it is well made. I am terrified to bonk it against anything accidentally- it's pretty loud from the double wall and has a very loud clang it makes sounding like you broke it (it's actually really sturdy)

"Have had this camera since March, and I love it. I had a Digital Elph before this, so I was a little spoiled by how tiny they are and how easily they fit into a pocketbook, but this one can fit, too... just a little bulkier because of the ""hump"" for the batteries.

It takes clear pictures and video, has withstood my dropping it, and does a good job of focusing on faces.

Two negatives: first, the lag between photos can be unbearable, particularly when the flash has been discharged. I tried taking pictures in a theatre and had to wait literally about 30 seconds in between shots... which is terrible when you're trying to capture something as it's happening! When I loaned the camera to someone, she told me, ""I'd return it if I were you. I have no idea how you stand that.""

Thing is, I love just about everything else about it. If I had the money, I'd buy a different camera to use indoors and keep this one for the outdoors/good lighting shots.

The other negative is that it really isn't great with red eyes. My whole family is prone to red eyes, and haven't yet found a camera that reliably fixes that problem.

"Pickleball has been around for a long time but I only started playing after my dad did during his retirement, which is the primary player these days. It's a relatively inexpensive game to set up if you have a double driveway, a net about the height of a tennis net (official 34 inches at center), a couple of paddles (a little larger than ping pong) and a Wiffle ball or ball with holes in it about 3 inches in diameter. Two or four players can play like most net sports.

If you want to be really cheap you could make a paddle out of 1/2 inch plywood and just tape the handle. But I got to try two paddles from Franklin Sports: one aluminum, the Challenger, and one wood, the Volt.

The aluminum paddle has a straight edge along the top, the wood is slightly rounded. The aluminum paddle has a nicer, rounded plastic edge where the plywood paddle has a square, hard plastic edge.

Contrary to the description both weigh just a fraction over 12 ounces.

The aluminum has a 6 inch handle and the wood has a 5 1/4 inch handle. But you will notice from my photo that the aluminum model has a piece of plastic that sticks up from the wrapped handle. This could be handy depending on where you prefer to place your thumb, in my case right at the back of the handle. This makes the aluminum handle about 6 1/2 inches long.

The aluminum paddle makes a ting sound, a bit more solid than the plywood paddle which actually sounds a bit dull. For my playing neither one works better except I prefer the solid ting like hitting a golf ball. The ""pros"" might notice the playing difference.

The aluminum paddle was about 2 bucks higher as of this writing. Unfortunately, you won't be able to tell the difference unless you play with them. You need at least two so you could get one of each like I did.",5.0,0

"I got this because the office I work in is notoriously cold, and I thought it would help to keep my feet warm as cold feet was my biggest complaint while at work and that, in turn, made the rest of me cold.

It doesn't stay put and often slides out from under my cubicle (in the 1/2 in space between the cube wall and floor) into the walkway of my cube farm,  The reviews I read said this worked well on carpet, well, the model I received does not.

It has an on/off switch which you have to manually turn on and off.  With some other models I'd looked at, you turned it on, and it shut itself off after an hour or two.  Not this one.  I often forget to turn it off at the end of the day.  Not a huge problem, but something to be aware of.

I've always noticed that game balls are real dark and when I got this one it was much lighter in color and real slick. On the box it has instructions  to revitalize the tacky grip. Take a Wilson  specific football brush (which I don't have just a stiff bristle brush will do) and brush the wax off the ball with moderate pressure. Take a damp cloth and wipe ball down and brush again. After it dried I brushed again to bring the shine and tack back. I used a paper towel and some dye came off but this is normal. This darkens the ball and brings the tack back to it. I've repeated this process twice and the ball looks and feels great. I included a couple of pics of each side of the ball.,5.0,0

"This mount lasted only about 2 years and it was placed under a protective eavestrough.  The biggest problem is that it is made almost exclusively for VERTICAL mounting (non very ""universal"").  Although I was able to get it positioned in a way that would allow a mount perpendicular to the siding, I would definitely NOT recommend it.  It is difficult to adjust, and it tends to slip.  In fact, even in a vertical position, the outer mount collar has an annoying tendency to rotate.  There is a thumb type knob, but this is practically useless.  There is also a screw ""port"" in the other side, and if it were possible to thread something in there, you might get better stability.  But nothing has been provided, and I've tried a wide range of metric and english bolts to no avail.

I actually bought two and never used the one, so when the first mount began to fail I used the second for spare parts.  Then I found they are not made quite the same way.  The worst part, is even light torquing of the camera mount screw will cause it to SHEAR off!  Nasty, junk.

"Well, I bought the Benjamin 392 for plinking away at tin cans and taking the occasional jack rabbit that might invade my garden, and I have to say that I am very impressed with this rifle so far. It's fairly quiet, and as a contractor, I have nail guns that are louder than my 392, so shooting in the back yard is not a problem. At only 4 pumps, Crosman ""destroyer"" pellets will go right through a unopened soda can at 5 yards, and Crosman hollow points, and pointed pellets are are also among my favorites. My only accessories were to keep it simple- I added a Benjamin sling, and had to install the swivels myself, but that was an easy task. I also added the Benjamin intermount in case I want to add a scope later, and that was it. The rifle is very accurate with its iron sights (for my use anyway), and it required very little break time. About 10 shots, and I had it sighted in, and putting pellets through the same hole after about 15 rounds...

Very pleased with the 392's appearance and perfromace. Its metal, and beautiful wood construction and its a proven design that has been around for decades. Its fairly easy to handle and a joy to shoot. I would totally recommend the 392 to anyone who just wants a good all-around .22 air rifle. I'd personally rate the rifle a 10 out of 10 stars for its design and reliability!

"Isn't it nice when some works out exactly the way it is supposed to?  I picked up a pair of Sony bookshelf speakers at a thrift shop months ago and decided it was time to mount them.  But I wanted a mounting that was simple, cheap, and effective, took a chance on these satellite speaker mounts and found them to be perfect.

The mounts can fit both single screw speakers (like my Sony) and double screw speakers, they can also be set up to be longer (about 5"") or shorter (about 3"") and come with the screws and hardware to mount to the speaker and to the wall (including dry wall anchors)  The mounts also include the Allen wrench necessary to adjust the mounts and permit the speaker to be oriented just about in any direction or attitude.

With the help of my cordless screwdriver, I had both speakers mounted nicely on the wall in about 15 minutes.  (And that includes looking over the included instructions until I realized that one could actually ignore them.)  Now these aren't the most beautiful speaker mounts, and they are plastic so don't try and mount some huge 20-lb speaker.  But for mounting small satellite speakers just about anywhere, these will work just fine, and at about $10 the price is just right.",5.0,0

"Sadly, I have tried this model again (for the 2nd time) and it still proved problematic for me. As for playing content, I agree it plays a vast number of differing file formats. But for me I encountered too many issues with this model to be a reliable solution or replacement of my older versions.

First, I want to say I own two older models (WDBAAN0000NBK) for several years and love it. My only negative is I am unable to configure them to indicate newly added content (not sure if this is doable).

Last year I tried a refurb version of the WDBYMN0000NBK-HESN and more recently purchased and returned a brand new unit. Both times I experience similar problems. Frequent glitches such as freeze-ups, audio mis-syncs and the inability to display multiple NAS devices simultaneously (to change NAS you need to go through several nested steps). I do not have any of these issues with the older models. To a lesser extent I too am not excited about the GUI as it appears to be trying too hard to be good looking more than functional.

I've had this in my car for 3 years now and I still love it. I have one in my car and the other in a garage. The sound is crystal clear and it's nice to have a little extra in the trunk. The size is perfect and the volume level is not loud enough to drown out my music. I also love the fact that it has a telescoping lens. I just can't imagine not having a camera on it. I like that it has a remote control for voice commands. It's not bulky but I really like that it has a built-in camera. I've found that it is really easy to operate it and not have to worry about it falling off the dashboard. I love that it has a USB charging port for my phone and tablet. It's a neat little gadget that I can keep in the trunk for long,5.0,1

"I've installed SmartThings in my home about a week ago and it already feels a waste of money. The original ads looked promising, but they have just one problem: little of this will work for you. The main problem of this kit is that you're very unlikely to force it doing anything useful.

THE GOOD
-Sensors and the hub look better than many other plastic junk boxes out there.
-The customer support works great. +1 star for that.
-Bundled ""things"" are very easy to connect.
-It sometimes works.

THE BAD
-The app has a decent look, but a terrible design: it's very confusing and often feels stupid.
-To make things worse the app will prompt you to buy extra stuff without being able to run a single scenario.
-Scenarios (here they're called apps) are both useless and confusing. Just need to pair a motion sensor and light? Good luck finding an easy way to do that.
-Sonos and Philips HUE support works. Only in beta. And only if you consider such (mis)behavior a ""work"".
-Bundled manual refers to the old version of the app. But who cares if it's useless anyway?

THE UGLY
-I've spent nearly 40 minutes trying to connect the hub to the app. I'm neither mentally limited nor twisted handed, but the whole process is so confusing that I'm not sure I'll be able to repeat it again.
-Good luck making the basic kit doing anything more useful than sending you an SMS when someone opens the door.

While this might have been a good introduction to home automation, SmartThings are in fact a useless trinket for a few geeks who might have fun solving all the puzzles within its clunky app.",2.0,0

I was hoping by buying in bulk I would be saving money but it was a waste. First off the lid always takes the whole end of the dauber off so it's an explosion of ink waiting to happen. After you unscrew the lid you have to take the lid and push down on the ink pad to get it to click back in. Also the colors are more like paint so lavander  you can't even see the numbers behind.

"My MacBook Pro gets hot. I have to run it with a cooling fan or it will start slowing down. (In order to keep itself from overheating, Macs manage the temperature by adding more idle processes into the queue until it's cooled down!)

I was using a different laptop cooling fan solution before this, but it was noisy and barely helping unless it was on high (extra loud mode).

When I ordered this, I was expecting better cooling from a larger fan, but the other MAJOR benefit to a large fan, and the main reason I bought this item, is that it's almost silent. Smaller fans spin faster and therefore make more noise.

This fan is almost as big as the 15"" MacBook Pro. The stand itself, leaves about 1"" around each side. You can use it with or without the stand. When sitting flat, it has a very clean and simple profile.

Finally, I love the bamboo - it was a final selling point for me.

BTW, they sell a ""pro"" version of this, with a nifty adjustable stand. I would have bought that, but it has two small fans, so it would be noisier than this one. I use this sitting flat with the lid closed and plugged into one monitor, so adjusting the angle is a moot point.",5.0,0

The screen is gorgeous , the keypad easy to use. If I had to quibble I'd say my biggest gripe is that flash and shockwave don't work yet. I know why apple has done that, but it's inconvenient. Youtube videos are fine. Battery life okay if you aren't on the internet the whole time -- i am, so it gets about five or six hours. Wifi reception has been excellent. Built in speaker is tinny and not loud enough, but i rarely use it so i didn't take off for that. There's an app to share files with your computer wirelessly, which is handy for transferring  stuff via webdav connection to read later when you have no connection. Another app lets you capture articles from news and web sources to revisit later. There's even an app to make voip calls from the touch. (you have to add earphones with a mic -- picked up a pair on amazon for $7 and now make occasional calls via Internet. there have been a few times that I REALLY missed not being able to connect when away from wifi, but I do not miss the 2 yr contract to at&t. if you have wireless handy and don't need a full service phone contract this is the answer.",5.0,0
"My favorite FLIP UP sights are the Taurus and the Taurus G17. I have one in my 6th FLIP UP, and it is the Taurus G17. This is the best optic I have ever owned. I was skeptical about the price of this product. I knew I was getting a good value, but I was wrong. I was shocked at how much more expensive it was than the most expensive gas stove I could find. I thought that I would have to return it to Amazon, but I was wrong. I purchased this stove for my first camping trip in a tent with no rain cover. I have used it for three days now, and it is still working as I expect. I was disappointed to see that the front of the stove has not fallen off or damaged.

Great product...I had to replace a couple of these around the house. They were pretty expensive, and had to be replaced every few years. I ended up with this one.

I love it. I have a portable phone, a tablet, and a book bag. I also use it when I run errands or do stuff for my family. I have a very small purse, and this is perfect for that. It has a small pocket on the back, which is nice. It has a nice strap, which is nice. The pockets on the back are very small, which is nice for keeping stuff in a small bag. It also has a nice pocket on the top, which is nice.

It is very small, which is nice. It does not look like it will last very long, but it does look like it will last a long time. It is very light and very well made.

It is very easy to install, so you can take it on a long bike ride. It is a little heavy for my liking, but it is a nice small tool to have in your pocket.

"I bought this as a gift to someone, so I do listen to them occasionally. I myself is using Klipsch Image X10i to listen to music everyday. In comparison to X10i, Ety have a cleaner high ends, instrument separations, and very clear vocal. Bass however though controlled, is a bit rolled off or rather more ""neutral"" in my opinion.
  If you want a more ""neutral"" sound or prefer instrumental and vocal songs, this is the phone to get, not implying that it lacks bass as it fairs quite well for its bass as well. To me, this is a ""bright"" sounding phone as compared with X10i.
  Built quality wise, top notch... loved the thick and durable feeling cables that it came with, hardly any tangles. Cable noise when brushed against your clothes are still there but very minimal.
  I would still stick with X10i due to the comfort it provides and its sound quality fairs quite well against the Ety as well. And I am a big fan of a ""warm"" sounding phone and X10i fits my book.
  Both are great high end phones that money could buy and if you do have a chance to audition the phone before purchasing it, please do so. But in my opinion, it doesn't get much better than these two.",4.0,0

"My last camcorder was sharp mini camcorder and I hate to buy tapes.  This camcorder sounds like a perfect fit.  I was pretty impressed with the quality of this when I saw someone took some video with this camera, and it was downsized too.  For $299 at amazon, I thought why not jump into the deal and I brought a 8gb sdhc card also.

I first took some video indoors at the highest settings and I noticed some noise when I took it, even with the flourscent light on.  Okay, I know about other reviewers who has problems taking videos in low light.  I took some pictures at the highest settings with the flash on and the pictures has alot of noise also.  Even most cameras with a flash can take decent pictures.

Took the camera outside on a bright sunny day with the highest settings and the videos didn't come out what I expected.  It was kind of noise when I took it and it wasn't as good as one of the reviewers showed.  The video quality was almost the same as my old minidv camcorder.  However, I looked at the pictures and it came out fine.  Then again, most other 7.1 digital camera should have no trouble taking pictures outside in a sunny day also.

I guess that I can't complain too much since I paid $300 for this camcorder but maybe if the quality is as good as advertised (even outdoors) I would give it 4 stars or more.",3.0,0

As a stereo bluetooth I love it. I love not having a wire connecting to my phone when I am working out. I don't know how many times I unplugged or ripped my phone out of my pocket when the wired headset cable got snagged on something. This is just so much more convenient. Some complain that the sound it not as good, but I find it more than adequate for working out. When you buy a stereo bluetooth you are not looking for concert sound as much as you are looking for the safety and convenience of not having connecting wires hanging out of your ears. My only complaint is the ear look is of very poor design. I have had to call Jabra several times to order replacements because the bendable wire section breaks from the hard plastic part that goes into the ear piece. It got to the point that Jabra would just send me 3 complimentary ear loops at no charge.",4.0,0

"I bought this to put in the back seat of my truck during road trips.  I got tired of dealing with ice/water/etc inside my truck.  The first use my wife and I got out of this was a trip to Utah from New Mexico, about a 13 hour drive.  It worked very well.  We also used this for a trip (5 hours) to the mountains and a couple of trips to the lake (about 1 hour).  It does take some time for this to cool room temperature drinks.  I recommend buying drinks that are already cold to put in there or cooling them in the fridge prior to going in the cooler.  I also recommend getting a blue ice pack (or something like that) to get the temperature of the cooler down in the beginning.  It is definitely easier for this to maintain, than it is to get cold on its own.  This is especially true during the summer months.

This cooler has a lot of room.  It fits perfect on the floor behind the center console of a Ram 1500 Crew Cab.  The fans on this are a little louder than what I expected, but with the radio on and highway noise it eventually gets unnoticeable.  I have not used the heating function of this yet and am not sure if I ever will.  We mostly do our trips in the summer months and that was the primary use I bought it for.

"Received the item well packaged and very fast. Took about twenty minutes for assembly. All the necessary tools are provided. The assembly steps are more or less intuitive so hardly necessary to read the instructions. The construction is quite good. The machinery fit and finish are almost top notch, but at this price one can hardly complain. The bike works well, will see on durability, but so far very good. After three years, this still works like when it was new. Excellent Value!

Four stars instead of five is largely due to screen, which is somewhat difficult to read. In this day and age of widely available LED readouts, one could have expected this to have a more readable lit screen, instead of LCD. Also, the mini fan is not very functional, but cute nonetheless. But I actually sometimes use the little fan feature as background noise so I can concentrate on my workout better.

"These curtains have been in my bedroom for over a month.
For the first week, I had them completely closed. What a difference from my summer curtains!! Absolutely NO light entered through them!
They blocked all of the ambient light: I almost thought that I had gone blind!
I usually wake up in the middle of the night for a quick run to the bathroom. But, with the curtains fully closed and no light at all, I had a rough time finding my way back to bed!!
Since I retired, I no longer keep a clock in the bedroom, and rely on the light coming in the windows to gauge the time of day.
So, after that first week, I was forced to leave the curtains open a tiny crack to let some daylight into the bedroom!
In addition, these curtains are a tremendous help in keeping out the cold winds that we suffer in the northeastern states.

I recommend this camera to anyone who is looking for a great camera for the price.I have a Nikon D7000 and it's about $300 cheaper than this.  The only reason I give it 5 stars is that the lens is a bit wide open, so you can see your subject better without the ability to see where you are looking.  I had a little trouble getting it to open, but after a few minutes it was just a little bit wider.  I am very happy with the camera and would buy again.  The quality is good.I've had this for 2 months now.  It works great, but I'm not sure if it's because I have it plugged in and connected to a different router.

"If I'd followed the fit guide they would have been a mess. Good thing I've lived with my petite self for so long I knew the larger size wouldn't work for me because I've got short hands. The smaller size is a bit snug, but not too tight. The length of palm from bottom of fingers to wrist is too long for me. They will be too long for any true petite leading to extra bunching in palm and thumb crease area. If you've got ""normal"" length fingers/hands they'll probably be fine.

The seam on the palm between the forefinger and thumb is fine on the left hand, but stiff, sharp and uncomfortable on the right hand. The padding doesn't seem like much, and there is still discomfort while riding, but post ride there is significantly less lingering discomfort than wearing none. The padding is in a great place to protect the meaty part of the lower palm. It seemed the middle of the palm didn't have much.

There are two very large tags in one glove, but I make sure they are folded up to the upper part of the hand vs. the palm and they haven't bothered me. The grey color is nice and the white parts help for hand signal visibility.  They were the best out of the 10 I tried on in a store, but there's room for improvement.

Still surprised that companies don't make goods in petite and tall versions of things. All the rest of the clothing fashion community can manage it, why not cycling?

Overall they're pretty good. If they were destroyed I'd get a pair again until I figure out that magical illusive well-fitting, perfectly padded pair.",3.0,0

Best feature I like is the four heat settings, each one turns on an additional tube for added warmth and allows me to set it for just the heat needed.

"Having used an Apple wireless mini keyboard with a Macbook Pro at my former job, I wanted to find something similar to use with the Dell laptop provided by my new employer. A full sized keyboard takes up too much desk space, and I had gotten used to the mini layout. This was the most similar product I could find.

I've been using this keyboard and mouse for a few days now and have no real complaint. The layout is familiar, so I'm not fatfingering things. The mouse is comfortable and responsive - pretty much the same size and shape as the compact Logitech mouse I use with my home system.

Good things:

- Keyboard and mouse are both solid and well made
- They both *look* solid and well made - attractive design and finish
- They both work as they should, and well

Not so good things (and this is a fairly subjective list):

- Keyboard is a bit loud and clicky for my taste
- Took a bit of time to figure out why they keys did not appear mapped to the right characters - the num lock was on. This may be a problem with my laptop, and not the keyboard
- I wish the mouse had rubbery sides
- I wish the keyboard had a power switch

"I put this stabilizer on my 1998 17' procraft bass boat with a 90hp mercury.

My main expectation of this stabilizer was quicker planing for faster out of the hole time. Fortunately for me It decreased that time by a couple seconds and made a HUGE improvement in handling and overall stability of the boat at speed. While running this stabilizer, the boat seems to glide straight through rough lake chop and wake like it never has before. It made my boat sit noticeably higher on plane which is probably the reason it ran through wake easier. I also noticed the handling seemed much more stable at all speeds and I could hold plane 5 mph slower than I could before. The trim seemed easier / smoother to adjust while getting on plane and the top end speed wasn't effected at all.

Overall the best bang for my buck I've ever received from any boat accesories I've purchased over the years. 100% happy with this purchase! It even impressed my friend who was real skeptical about it. I call that a win-win.",5.0,0

It should be noted that this unit is similar to other `soundbar' types of speaker systems; therefore if you sit too far from your TV you may not fully experience left and right channel separation.

"This is the worst purchase I have ever made from Amazon. I have had the mattress for several days, opened and laying on my bed frame. It is supposed to be a 6 inch mattress and won't inflate beyond 4 inches. I got tired of sleeping in a recliner and tried to sleep on this thing last night. After an hour of being completely uncomfortable, I put my old two inch foam topper on it and tried sleeping again. No go. This thing gives and doesn't bounce back. It's like sleeping on a board. I am sore all over after my two attempts at trying to sleep. I am contacting Amazon for a return/refund. Don't waste your time buying thing thing, even for a guest room -- your guests will hate you if you do! And, when it was opened, there was a stink in the room coming off the mattress. It off gassed for two days. I received this in Nov, 2017 and the tag on the mattress said it was made in China in Sept, 2016. So it was manufactured, then rolled up tight for over a year. No wonder it doesn't inflate. I am very, very disappointed in this. UPDATE: I returned the mattress to Amazon. There was no hastle, arranged for UPS to pick it up and the refund to my account was issued within 2 hours of being picked up. The hardest part about the return was rolling up the mattress (it was very stiff in the middle), tying it off, wrapping it up in the plastic it came in and then taping card board all around the plastic.

"This CPU was too fast.

Amazon needs a way to prevent OUIs (ordering under the influence). One morning not long ago I woke up with a terrible hangover, not quite sure what happened the night before. Upon checking my email that morning, I noticed a shipment notification for a Intel Core i7-3930K Hexa-Core Processor. I realized I must have ordered in a drunken blur, and through the haze I indeed remembered placing some kind of order.

I was shocked, but decided to go ahead and let the order go through. After all, I had been debating this purchase for weeks and just didn't want to shell out the dough for this wicked CPU. After all, I told myself, I already had a quad-core 2700k overclocked to 5 GHZ, why would I need the 3930k with six cores and amazing stats?

But it was on the way. The 2700k at 5 GHZ was already a beast, and I found through practice I could reign it in and handle it, so thought I was ready for this 3930k and its hexacore awesomeness... well I was wrong.

To make a long story short, the power of my PC outfit with this CPU literally destroyed my mind. It was far, far beyond my control. I wrestled it for hours in epic battles through various intense games and applications, certain I could reign it in, but in the end it left me a quivering, sweating mass, as blood and drool sprayed forth from me in profuse waves. I don't want to go into the detail of the things I saw while this CPU rendered 12 threads of everything I threw at it at billions of calculations per second, but suffice it to say mortal human minds can't handle it.

In summary, I am sending it back -- it is too fast. I need to give it 5 stars because it is truly amazing. Words of advice: Do not OUI, and do not think other fast CPUs you have used have in any way prepared you for this one -- they have not.",5.0,0

"I swim everyday as part of my exercise regime, and whenever I do not protect my eyes, they burn and become pink from the harsh chlorine in the water. I wanted a good quality pair of goggles to help me keep my eyes safe, and the Ipow Anti-fog Mirrored Silicone Swimming Goggles with UV Protection Plating Glasses + Premium Goggles Case seemed like an excellent option for me, so I decided to try it out.

These goggles seal watertight against my face, completely protecting me from water leaking through them and onto my eyes. They are cushioned, and their head strap is a comfortable silicone material. The lenses of the goggles are described by the manufacturer as anti-fogging, and so far I have not experienced any issues with fogging. They seem to live up to their claim. I feel comfortable wearing these goggles, and my eyes are wonderfully protected from burning and irritation caused by the chlorine water.

I truly do love these goggles. They are great for casual swimmers like myself, who just use them for exercise or for simple fun in the pool, but they would also be ideal for competitive swimmers. Their quality is very high, and they are so comfortable and effective. I am so happy that I ordered them. I intend to get a lot of use out of these goggles, and I believe that they will last me for a very long time.

I must disclose that this product was received at a discounted cost for my honest and unbiased review. My opinion was not altered due to the product being discounted. If I do not believe in a product, I will not give it a positive rating. Please leave a comment if you have any further questions. Thanks for taking the time to read my review!",5.0,0

"I do not own this rifle but am open to purchasing one.  The reviews are very positive, but some reviewers mention 'barrel-droop.'  Amazon even sells a device to bolt onto the gun to mitigate 'barrel-droop' so this must be a real issue. Reviews of other manufacturers' guns do not mention 'barrel-droop' so I can only conclude that RWS has an issue other manufacturers do not.

But if this is such a great gun, why does one have to purchase an extra device to mitigate what appears to me to be either a design issue or a manufacturing defect?  I would love to hear a real explanation from an expert.  Until then, I will postpone any purchase decision.

The camera is amazing in every way except for that it has a noticeable shake on the outside edge when shooting in 4k mounted on a tripod. This is a very well known issue with this camera and they claimed to have fixed it with a firmware patch but after applying the firmware the problem still remains. Even when you disable the steady shot feature it still happens so something else is causing the optics to vibrate inside of the camera. Sony has been little help so far with correcting the issue and even claimed the couldn't tell when I sent them a video clearly illustrating the problem.

"I've had one of these for 3 years now, and would still buy it all over again.

Yeh, it's a little heavy.  But I'll trade that for all the flimsy vacuums I had previously put together.  And really the only other vacuum that's even compared to this one was my Kirby from 10 years ago, and that thing was beyond heavy.  I'm female, and can take this thing up and down my stairs regularly, and though it is a little on the heavy side, it's WELL worth it in terms of cleaning power.

It has a ton of attachments right there where you can get to them easily, along with an easy yellow knob for switching between floor mode and hose, and you can of course adjust according to carpet height.  Sometimes I wish the hose itself was a little longer, but that's what the extenders are for.  Using the various attachments I can vacuum everything from throw rugs, to couches, to lampshades, ceiling cobwebs, fan grates, and just about anything else you can think of.  Just beware that it's powerful enough in floor mode to shred certain things unintentionally.  I learned this on one of my throw rugs.  The thing just gobbles up anything loose, what can I say?

Durability?  Heh, I've run this thing into walls, steps, you name it - it takes a scuff and keeps on going.

The one thing to be aware of with this vacuum is that you will need to be diligent about checking/changing the bag.  Because it sucks so well, the bag will fill up quickly.  I've made this mistake countless times (probably why I do find it a little heavier.. lol), because I let it get really full after being so used to my previous vacuums that didn't suck as well.  I can also say I've never needed to replace anything non-filter related on this ever - not even the belt.

"I've now had this TV for a year. It has been nothing short of a nightmare. I have a sony ps3 and an iPhone. Streaming to it from the phone is hit or miss. My internet is well over spec for this to function but it barely ever does. Most days we decide to watch something on the TV it just doesn't want to work.  The playstation is wired to it and gets unrecognized by the TV so often and decides not to work anymore. Yes my ps3 works just fine on real tvs. It's updated as much as it can be. There is just no reason to make such a dumb product as this. Why can't it just be a TV and play whatever I play on it? Sony has killed my enthusiasm for all things entertainment.

"This performed wonderfully in my first triathlon this past May, Olympic distance. I did not wear any triglide or lubricants underneath mine and did not have any significant chaffing or rashes form. I say significant, because my bike seat unfortunately isn't the most comfortable seat in the world so I do get slight uncomforts from sitting on it for so long. The ""cushy in your tushy"" isn't the greatest in the world, but these aren't bike shorts either. You also swim and run in this as well, and the two things I would never want to do in bike shorts is swim and run.

The pocket in the back was great for storing a gel in while on the run. Even immediately after my triathlon and I was still sweaty (and the suit still wet) I was very easily able to pull it down over my shoulders and down to my waste with ease. It fit me quite snug, but in a racing situation, this is exactly what I was looking for. Aerodynamics are important. I would recommend this to people looking to get into doing a triathlon for the first time.

While I plan on continuing my triathlon experience into next year and beyond, eventually doing a HIM or IM (half/full ironman) I'm not sure that I would want to wear this particular suit for such a long distance on the bike (50/100 miles) due to the lack of padding.

"Low-end, Shimano/SRAM hub compatible 9-speed cassette.  It's heavy, and designed for steel hubs.  Works like a champ.  Holds up to high wattage, and standing on a climb in the large gear.

If you have aluminum or titanium hubs, or are concerned about a couple of ounces of weight, then you want a higher-numbered cassette with a large-gear spider.

This is very wide range, pretty evenly stepped from 11T to 34T.  This is great for a compact double crankset (34/50), giving a 1:1 (WHEELIES!) for monster climbs, and a 4.5:1 for powering downhill at 35mph.

Since it's 9-speed, and such a wide range, you may find some of the mid spacing a little too much if you are mostly on even, flat pavement.

If you do only hard, off-road climbs, you may find this is not enough (vs some of the new 42T pizza plates lately).
END 2014 review

EDIT 2017 - Subtracting a star because the description now says it has a spider, but it does not.  A spider is a solid block of aluminum serving as the core for the biggest cogwheels.  It reduces weight, and distributes the load so high-wattage does not dig into the freehub splines.  THIS CASSETTE DOES NOT HAVE THAT.  The description should not say it does.",4.0,0

No dead/bright/stuck pixels on the unit I received, which was a great start.  It's a very thin panel, not much weight to it at all, and the bezel is small and looks nice.  The included stand is garbage, like most at this price point - I'd recommend a VESA mount to give you more ability to adjust the height and angle.  Watching streaming video online worked well, and the screen kept up with fast motion in action movies, but brightness is an issue sometimes - best to keep this monitor in a darker room.

"I bought one of these and it works fine.  I will keep my review in order to share my experiences.  The plastic parts are very sturdy, and the cover is very sturdy.  The only complaint I have is that it seems to be a little heavy for such a small item.  It is a bit heavy for a non-small item, but I've had no problems with it.  I'm not sure if the metal is heavy or if it's not.  I'd suggest getting one of the smaller plastic covers.  They are very sturdy and feel very durable.  The case is a good size, and it has a nice feel to it.  The only complaint I have is that it does not come with a case for the Micro USB 3.0 ports.  I don't know if that is the case or if the plastic covers are just too small, but I have not tried the case yet.  I would definitely recommend this product.  I'll update this review if I find any flaws.Works great. I used it to make a sketch on my kitchen floor, and it worked great. The size is perfect for the laptop.

"Before I got this device I needed three remotes to control my tv/home theater system. Now that I have it I need... three remotes to control my tv/home theater system.
I'll give them one of the controllers - only my tv's original remote controls aspect ratio (my educational dvds are in 4:3) and I am unaware of universals that fulfill that function.
But this remote won't allow me to change the input on my receiver. I still need the original receiver remote to do that. If there is a way to do it, I haven't figured it out. And although the manual says they are ready to assist by phone or emai, they don't answer the phone, nor emails.
btw, if you set up the power button to punch through and turn on more than one device, you have to learn the timing. If you press the button too quickly the entire macro won't run and not all devices will turn on. If you press it too long the macro will continue running and turn some devices back off. In either case you will be out of sync, and can only get back in sync manually (or by using an original remote) to get the devices lined up in the proper on/off state as designed by your macro.

"I'm very disappointed in this drive, as even with large files I can't write faster than 80MB/sec on a USB 3.0 port. But I don't think it's the drive's fault, as it's capable of much faster speeds and other people get those speeds.

The issue with these very fast USB 3.0 drives is that their speed is very much affected by the chipset being used, and the chipset drives. I am using a 2yr-old ASUS motherboard and it uses the ASMedia USB 3.9 chipset. It's a highly regarded chipset but it came out after the NEC/Renasys (sp?) and drivers seem optimized for the latter.

The odd thing is that I bought a 32 GB SanDIsk Extreme (not the Pro version, as this is new) last year and it's blazingly fast on the same port on the same computer, so I would have expected this to be at least that fast.

One thing to mention: These are expensive drives and the 32 GB Extreme was and still is expensive. The competition 3.0 drives have dropped but not the SanDisk Extremes, which I think is fair as they are so much faster. (I have a couple of other brands USB 3.0 flash drives and they are laughably slow compared to the SanDisks.)  However, what stunned me about the Extreme series, given the price, was how incredibly cheaply made they are. They are made of the crummiest plastic you can imagine and I'm sure I could squeeze and shatter it pretty easily.

With this new Extreme Pro series, there's still some of that, and these are far more physically delicate drives than other brands (esp given the price) but they don't feel quite as delicate as the Extreme series.",4.0,0

The volume control is a little heavy so if you are moving around and don't clip the audio control somewhere it will pull it out of your ear (that's why they provided a clip) and since the cord comes shipped wrapped up very tightly, the cord is bent all over the place back and forth and will take quite a bit of time to straighten out.  Wrapping it around the provided 'cord manager' will cause this as well if left for long periods of time.

I went for the silicon rings as I'd tried a metal egg ring my daughter loaned me and wasn't happy with it, size or clean up. These rings work GREAT!

Cleanup is fast and easy unless you let them sit for a few hours (won't do that again) in which case it still takes minimal effort. Packaging was fine although when I first opened the box and packaging I noticed the rings didn't lay flat. However, the instructions say to let them sit 30 seconds on the hot pan which lets them flatten out. Had no issues with seepage. I also wasn't impressed with the suggestion to add some water and cover them while cooking, but I tried it and now do it every time.

This one comes apart and goes back together very easy, and is VERY easy to clean.  You don't even need a dishwasher.  It juices everything the centrifugal models do, PLUS leafy greens like collards, kale, swiss chard, cabbage, parsely, etc.  And it's quiet while running.  Of course it is much more expensive, but it's built well and has a powerful motor (you could probably juice rocks with this thing - though I wouldn't recommend trying that).  The only real negative for me is that the feed tube is only like 1.5 inches in diameter.

"I cut this device a lot a slack in terms of criticism because it was so inexpensive (under $40).  It works as described and, with a little tedious fine tuning, it delivers a pretty clear picture.
But, it could be a lot better.  The camera lens zoom and focus is pre-set and not adjustable.  The only way to change the zoom is to physically move the camer back or forth.  This makes finding a place to hide the camera much more difficult and challanging. The mounting bracket also adds to the challenge--it doubles the height of the unit, and is intended to be mounted with the included, tiny wood wood screws.  Using the the knob on the receiver to fine tune the reception from the transmitter is what migraines are made of--keep the Tylenol handy. It's similar to trying to fine tune the dial on an am clock radio with week reception. When used with a Slingbox this camera makes a pretty neat nanny cam--the live feed can be viewed from any web browser or from a smart phone (e.g. iphone, blackberry) and can be recorded to PC if desired.",4.0,0
"**EDIT** I took it on a trip and bought a new one after a few weeks. I'm very pleased with the new one. The stitching is very well made, the stitching is pretty straight, and it's not overly stiff.

"First and foremost, I do not get paid to write reviews. I also did not receive this product for free in exchange for a good review.

This is no lightweight bike. I was actually pretty stunned to receive the box and there was considerable weight to it. The instructions were decent and it took about 20 minutes to put together. The only thing is that the pedals and straps are plastic, so I wonder how long they will hold up.

This is a very quiet bike. I can easily be riding this while watching TV and I never need to increase the volume. Its literally that quiet.

The little display is decent and does a fairly good job. Just know that you will need to hold the button down to reset your last ride information.

There is quite the large seat on this, but with the pedals where they are, you won't use much of it unless you have super long legs. Im 511 and I can only use the front half of the seat. Its fairly comfortable and Im thankful for that.

If there is one *ding* to this bike is the seat location compared to the pedals. My butt is roughly at 50 degrees to the metals, which isn't a normal feeling. Its abojt midway between a normal bike and a recumbent bike. I do wish the pedals were more beneath me like a normal bike, but for a space saver bike at this price, I cant really complain too much.

I will update in the months to come with any updates on quality.",4.0,0

"Keyword:  TUNITY
If you use the app Tunity on your phone to tune into and listen to TV channels on your phone via the Bluetooth speaker in a loud bar, then be ready to be disappointed.  I bought this specifically to listen to Bellator MMA (Spike TV/Paramount) while I was at my local bar.  The bar plays loud music and has tons of TV's.  So I had them put one TV on to the Bellator MMA fights and I used Tunity to play the audio over this BT speaker.  It wasn't loud enough though.  I had to hold the speaker right up to my ear just to hear the announcer on TV calling the fight plays.  So I'm going back to my 10W DIY bluetooth speaker and its heavy batteries instead.  Otherwise, I thought his BT speaker was nice.  It's tuned to play cleanly at full volume.  It just doesn't have ENOUGH volume.  Maybe if there was a button you could press to tune it for vocals only, then it could have played that louder.  Like a quick EQ button.  One EQ setting for music and one EQ setting for vocals only, that could play louder.",4.0,0
"The company that supplied this ""used"" MBPr was extremely helpful. It wasn't really a used machine as far as I can tell. This came in the original box (more on that later) and shrunk wrapped.

When I placed the order, it wasn't supposed to arrive for 4-5 days. I contacted the seller and asked if they could please ship it quicker. I also mentioned I would pay whatever the additional charge would be. They replied quickly, had it delivered in two days (NY to NJ) and there was no additional charge.

I was thrilled. That is until I saw the laptop box. It was in bad shape. Not horrible, but one of the corners (and under the corner) was severely damaged. Crinkled and partially crushed. Enough so that it caused some concern about the laptops possible condition when I opened it. Turns out the laptop was in flawless condition, so no biggie. The box is still useable (although damaged) for eventual resale. I'm assuming the box was damaged BEFORE they sent it since the shipping box that contained the laptop and it's box was in great condition. Hmmm....

Anyway, it was listed as used, but there wasn't a scratch, ding or dent of any kind. Bottom line, I got a great machine with no damage for a great price with excellent customer service. No complaints. Just wish the laptop box wasn't damaged. That's the only reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5.

Highly recommend!!

First let me say I am a Kershaw, Zero Tolerance type of guy, but I have seen so many people rave about Spyderco that I decided to take a look at the Tenacious. Some consider this to be one of the top EDC blades under $50 bucks. So what the hell I pulled the trigger and got one.

Man I am glad I did, the feel of this baby is sweet, the ergonomics of the knife is excellent and it just fits my hands like a glove. It's really a good size for EDC pocket carry and it feels extremely light to me while it's in my pocket and in my hand. I really like the G10 handles, good sturdy gripping.

Update (5 stars):
I've just taken the socks out for an 11 mile hike across rocky terrain in 80F weather. The socks performed really well. They felt comfortable in my boots and were thick enough to keep any blisters forming. I was a bit apprehensive about wearing wool in summer, but I found that they did not feel too hot at all. On the contrary, they kept my feet pretty dry, especially compared to the cotton socks that I normally wear, which normally make my feet feel like they are swimming.

"In an attempt to save some money by eating out less, I went on a quest for the best way to bake a frozen pizza (which puts me back $5 vs the $20 for takeout).
I am not a fan of placing the frozen pizza directly on the oven rack.  The hassle of having to remove and wash the rack after each use (as well having to clean the cheese that drips off onto the oven floor) made this a non-option.
Pizza sheets for baking result in a soggy crust.
I tried a ceramic pizza stone and precisely followed the directions of preheating then placing the frozen pizza onto it for baking.  The outer edges were nice and crispy but the center was always soggy.  Also any cheese that got onto the stone was an ordeal to wash off.
Then I saw this baking rack... I did follow the advice of previous reviews and measured my baking sheet to make sure it fit.  I also line the baking sheet with some foil for easy clean up.  This was the perfect solution!!!  The frozen pizzas turn out evenly cooked and no soggy middle!!  In the time it takes to call a restaurant then drive out to pick up the pizza (or have it delivered), I can have one made for 1/4 the price (and serve it piping hot directly from the oven) at home!!!
I also made some baked sweet potato fries on this rack and they turned out great too!!!  Only advice is to not overload it or the fries will not evenly cook.",5.0,0

"I really wanted to love this camera.  But the noise levels and expensive lens selection wouldn't allow me to keep it.
I literally liked this camera so much I almost considered buying the meta bones speed booster adapter so I could use faster lenses from Nikon or Canon, but then I realized I'm getting into the higher end price range of cameras with much better sensors.  It was SO close, but not usable for me beyond a hobby camera.

With the poor battery life, had to buy lots of extra batteries. Seriously, if you want to film 4k video for wedding work you will need about ten batteries.
With poor noise / image quality (spend way too much time in post production)
With poor button layout (spend more time fiddling with buttons, less time taking pictures)

Pros:
- PRICE (wow at this price I would buy 3 of these)
- SIZE (fits in any bag)
- WEIGHT -- Light weight
- AUTO FOCUS -- Great auto focus
- STABILIZATION FOR PHOTOS -- Has Dual Stabilization for still photos (in camera + lens)
- COLOR -- Great color
- SCREEN -- tilts, swivel, touch screen, multi-touch. It's perfect!!
- Viewfinder -- best viewfinder I've ever used in my life!!!

Cons
- BUTTONS Physical button layout is terrible. (ISO, Shutter speed, F-stop should be together)
- STABILIZATION No Dual Stabilization for video (in camera + lens)
- BATTERY LIFE is horrible (you will need 3-4 batteries to compare to 1 DLSR battery)

"The laser can actually be dialed in. I wasn't expecting that, but this pleased me inordinately. Remember to dial it in properly, though. I discovered this the hard way in an airsoft game.

It comes with a pressure switch as well, although I have no idea where I'm gonna place mine. Not the easiest device to operate if you don't have the pressure switch though.

"I've been using this on and off for a few months, and suddenly the spring button just snapped off, and now it's useless. While it was working, the plastic bottle is durable and can withstand drops. I don't like the circular ring because it kind of digs/cuts into your fingers if you hold it by there. Another difficulty is that the infuser part - has 2 parts - a plastic circular lid with holes and then the infuser where you put the fruit in. the plastic lid just sits on top of it, and then the two pieces are screwed in. Thus, it is easy to lose the little plastic circular part when you take it apart for cleaning. They do give you two - the purple smaller one and the longer clear infuser, which I personally use(d) the most because it could hold more fruit. Also, the shorter infuser required you to have the bottle full or shaken or sideways to keep the fruit submerged in the water if you drank even just half! There is a locking system for the lid - but it became quite loose after time. Remember, I only used this not that many times. Finally, the worst part was screwing the lid onto the bottle - it is easy to screw it on improperly - and thus instantly leaks - so you have to be very careful each time to make sure you screw it on perfectly horizontal, and that's not something I need in the morning if I'm in a rush to workout or just go to work!

"Took it shooting yesterday. Only took 6 rds to get it dialed in at 50 yards right out of the box!! The clarity outside in actual use was far better than what I thought while looking through it inside my house at night, from 3x all through 12x. The side parallax adjustment is great as well. I was able to ring steel at 200 with boring regularity, and it didn't seem to lose zero after 100 rounds of .308. Only complaint is that there is a little bit of distortion and the edges of the filed of view, but it's only noticeable if you intentionally look at the edges.

The illuminated reticle uses a light that washes all over the inside of the scope, not just on the crosshairs, so that is a bit of an annoyance, but I don't forsee myself using the illuminated reticle. Just putting that out for those that will.

The rings that come with the scope appear to be of phenomenal quality, every bit as good as the Warne rings I purchased for another rifle. There are 4 screws per ring that tighten around the tube, which I feel provides a far more secure mount.

I wish the rings positioned it a hair higher, but overall I am extremely pleased with the performance of the scope. Even more so considering for my $113 delivered to my door, I got a set of rings that seem every bit as good as the last 30mm rings I got from Warne for another AR.

I would say this would make a great scope for someone looking for a decent scope on a budget, especially considering it's a 30mm tube!!",4.0,0

"I upgraded my Denon 2809CI for the SR5008.  The SR5008 chassis size is not as deep so it doesn't take up as much space on the shelf.  Since this is the bedroom I have a simple two channel setup with Axiom M60 floorstanding speakers and HSU Research STF-2 subwoofer.  I like the attention to detail such as the little vibration absorbing material (looks like Sorbothane soft rubber) on the feet to protect the electronics from the nearby subwoofer.

Previously I could not use Audessy with the older Denon because of the simple speaker setup.  Now with the Marantz SR5008 I was able to fly through the Audessy measurements and the sound difference is NIGHT AND DAY!  With the Audessy calibrated stereo setup, the sound is 3-dimensional and super clear.  I'm also selected the bi-amp option for the front speakers just to try it out (not sure if that makes a difference, but it's cool to have the option to put those extra Watts to use).  I would describe it as having a ""warm"" sound which I love.  I used to be a musician and I can distinguish subtle differences in sound quality.

The on-screen menu is very simple and easy to navigate.  When streaming Pandora Internet Radio, the song name and play timer is displayed on the Marantz portal window so I can still see the song name while the TV is turned off.  Some review on the web mentioned the lack of WiFi, but I think it would be silly to integrate WiFi into a high end AVR receiver because WiFi technology is changing so fast (802.11G, N, AC, etc. will be obsolete well before the receiver is outdated).

"This bag is working out perfectly for my wife in her new job. She never removes it from the wheels as it takes a couple minutes to convert over and isn't really hard to shoulder carry with the wheels.
Hint: Remove the rain cover from the cart and store it in the bag rather than where the company hides it.
She wanted the red one, but I talked her into black and she is glad I did. The Red/Black combo tries to look stylish, but comes off too industrial in real life. The red bag by itself would be terrific, but not paired with the black rolling cart. Interior size is adequate as expected. Anything roomier would look like every other generic rolling case. This vertical bag stands out from the crowd, but remains professional. I thought the patent leather would be gaudy, but it's subdued by the patterns.  Be a good husband and purchase this.",5.0,0

"I was really impressed with the bag when I received it and packed it out.  Took it to the range the first time with one rifle and magazines in the pouches.  Great storage, nice internal securing straps, easy to handle and overall great protection.

On the second trip I added the second rifle in the other main compartment side (compartment has divider) and thought what a great space saver this was.  Two guns one bag and all my magazines in the external pockets.  The bag has some cool back pack straps, in the next few seconds I realized how weak the stitching and hardware was.  When I hefted the bag to the first shoulder strap it immediately gave and way and fell to the ground.  It simply could not handle the weight.  The bag has four d-rings that accept two clips from each shoulder strap.  After inspection the d-ring ripped right off the bag, all stitching was pulled out.

Wow I was upset.  I really loved the bag and realized the d-rings are undersized in diameter and their opening in my opinion is too large, very small diameter and the weight is point loaded because the straps twist under the weight, very sloppy,  Even with great stitching it is a  poor design.  Definitely the Achilles Heel of the bag after more thorough inspection.

I like the bag so much I contemplating upgrading and having it better stitched.  Then I realized I did not want to put the money into something to fix poor quality.  It could have been a bad stitching job but I don't want to risk.  It is not easy repacking and returning, waiting for credit or replacement.  Think I will cut my loses and try another brand.",1.0,0

"I purchased the H80 model when I decided to upgrade to a better case. I was unfamiliar with liquid cpu coolers, so I didn't really know what to expect. It comes with several different fittings, so you can be sure that it will fit on your motherboard. The important thing to do when researching these is to make sure you have the correct space to fit the radiator. I opted for the H80, and I'm glad I did. It seems to be very well made, I checked all the seams to make sure there were no leaks, and I checked the hoses for any cuts, and all was in perfect order.

The included instructions are kind of a joke, there a are only pictures showing the different setup for the various fittings, they don't actually explain how to install it, but it is pretty self explanatory if you have some tech sense.

All in all I am pretty happy with the purchase, I have had no problems with it, and it has kept my cpu cooler than my old cpu fan, even during long gaming sessions and photo and video editing.

The one thing that makes me give it a four star rating instead of a five star rating are the fans and the connectors. The connectors are 3 pins instead of 4, which means the fans will run on full sail the entire time. They end up sounding like a jet engine, and was so loud I could hear it downstairs through my floor. I bought a NZXT fan controller, and was able to turn them down. The noise is much more acceptable.

"I bought this for my fianc, because we live in a bad area.

Pros:
-Much more natural to use/hold than a common can of pepper spray.
-Well built, feels solid.  It has a thick screw in piece in the back (like a flashlight) where you can remove the propellant.
-Detachable keychain is perfect.  It takes a good bit of force to detach, which is good.

Cons:
-Very short range.  We bought a practice spray canister to try it out, and the spray only has an effective range of about 5 feet.  At the end of this 5 feet it has turned into a cloud of mist, so any breeze will reduce the range even further or cause self harm by blowing it back in your face.  But it is still effective as a last resort close range spray.
-Button is easy to press.  Moving it forward and down does not take as much force as I expected, so it seems there is a risk of it going off accidentally in a purse or pocket, especially since the button is raised and can catch onto things.  This has not happened yet though.
-Extremely limited capacity.  the spray canister is TINY.  You only get a few short sprays out of this, or about a 3 second long spray.  This could be a pro for some, as its less likely a bad guy can use it against you once you unload it.
-As mentioned by others it looks inappropriate from the top.  Someone made some bad design choices on its appearance.

While there may appear to be more cons than pros, this serves its purpose as an easy to use, last resort, close range pepper spray.  It feels very natural and is easy to aim/conceal.  Its always ready if its on your keychain and can be detached if your keys are in the ignition.
I would recommend getting a practice canister to get used to how the button works and the aiming/effective range.",5.0,0

"Not the best shoe storage container I've had, but it works. The fabric is a bit thin, and I feel that my heels will eventually poke through it. There isn't much support and mind definitely doesn't stand up stiff like the one shown in the picture. This would be perfect for child shoes, or for flats. Tennis shoes and heels do not fit together in one slot. They take up two because of how small the slots are. That being said, I put my expensive shoes in this container so that they don't get ruined or dirty by other things in my closet or by other shoes touching them. I keep it in my closet as it doesn't fit under the style bed frame I have, and it works wonderfully to keep them clean and organized.

"First I'll talk about the set-up process. Mercy, it was a pain! Once I got over the overwhelming amount of pieces and hardware, the set-up started off easily enough. I was fooled into thinking things would go smoothly. That changed quickly. I had a hard time getting many of the little hardware pieces to fit where they were supposed to. It was very frustrating. The worst part, I think, was the sticky paper that was attached to the glass-like plastic shelves. It did not come off easily! I ended up having to buy a bottle of ""goo gone"" to help get it off, because it looked so horrible.

Now to the looks of the final product. I don't really have any complaints. It not overly my style, so it's ended up as a storage shelf in my boys' closet. It's hard black plastic and thick white paper for the most part. It looks like something you'd see in a garage or maybe a dorm room or classroom setting. I think more than anything, it will depend on a person's individual style.

Overall, is this something I would recommend to my family and friends? No, unfortunately not. I think there are easier and less expensive options for what it is. Other than the set-up process, though, I don't have any complaints at this point, so I also wouldn't overly NOT recommend it, either.",3.0,0

It's obviously a knock-off of the Harris design, but with a few twists that in my opinion, make it even better. First off, all of Harris' bipods are designed for a swivel sling mount. You have to get an adapter to make it fit a Picitinny rail. This adds unnecessary height, bulk and weight to the unit. UTG did it right by making it fit the Picitinny rail first and even threw in an adapter for a swivel sling mount if you're so inclined. The legs are really solid even at full extension and the panning feature works great without having to loosen a knob. This is a steal at this price. I'd buy another in a heartbeat.",5.0,0
I purchased this bike online and it arrived on time. I will update this review if I find a difference. I had a friend who was very happy with her bike. She was skeptical that it was a bicycle. She says it is very sturdy. This one is a little bit larger than she thought. She says it is heavier than she thought. So it is a little heavier than she expected. It does not have a lot of grip on it. It is well made and does not come with a disc brake. The only thing I would change is that it has a small vent on it to allow it to sit upright. It is a little thicker than I thought. I am not sure why it is thinner. I would prefer it to be thicker. It is not as comfortable as I thought it would be.

"I do like it. It works well. The complaints I have about it are relatively minor:
1) It does use quite a bit of space. To keep the arms from extending beyond the back of my desk (which was important in my particular setting), I had to mount it (drill the hole) almost 12"" in from the back edge of the desk. That places the monitors about 15"" in from the back edge of the desk.
2) Cord management is minimal. The upper of the arms, the cords are simply ""tied under"". The lower of the arms, the cords are held inside by the most complex piece of molded plastic known to man, which must be carefully inserted by a Plastics-Certified Brain Surgeon. I am surprised that they didn't think to allow the cord management to share a hole with the support itself, which would have been handy.
3) It says ""amazon basics"" on a prominent logo right in the middle of the base. I don't need more logos on my stuff, unless you're going to pay me handsomely to display them. (This will work to cover the logo: https://smile.amazon.com/Scotch-Duct-Black-1-88-Inch-60-Yard/dp/B0013AX6FC/)

I would recommend this mat to anyone looking for a mat that is comfortable and easy to use. I use this as a hiking pack. The first time I used it I was going to park in the woods and it was a little uncomfortable. I was able to pull it off the pack and on my way back to the campsite. I have never used it before, so I will probably never use it again. I have a friend who has a pack of this that he keeps in his truck. We bought a second pack of this for his and we both love it. It is a little uncomfortable and I had to go back and forth to put the pack on. I'm happy with the purchase.",5.0,1

Based on other positive reviews, it seems that three things are possible:

1. User error by me (I don't *think* that's the case, but i'm not so arrogant as to rule it out). I would guess I am at least slightly physically stronger than the average user of this pump, so I don't think that's the issue either.
2. Poor quality control (some people get great ones, a few get lemons)
3. Widespread dishonesty/pay-to-review arrangements (I haven't looked for evidence of this, but I have seen other unrelated products fall victim to this).

"Pros- Great picture, slim design, light weight, 3d conversion is pretty cool.
Cons- Samsung App store is a joke, at best.  If you are only buying the TV for that, wait for a while to see if ""Smart TV's"" really take off.  No one is writing apps for them yet and the ones that are out are pretty lame/useless/not fun.  Even the YouTube app doesnt work with the keyboard side of the TV remote...fail.

Update (a little over one year later 12/30/2012)
Picture is still amazing and the small edges set this TV apart; best i've ever seen...it does have 240hz refresh rate (not CMR...what a joke).
The app store has not gotten much better.  I enjoy the CNET app, which is pretty much the only one I've downloaded after the fact that was worth anything.

Oh...3d glasses are HORRIBLE.  They do not last.  I have 1/4 that is still alive after a year.  The 2 i bought seperate from the TV (same model number as the ones that came with) didn't work all that great the moment i took them out of the box.
Even if they were working properly, don't expect to make it all the way through a long movie like Avatar without them dying on you.  that is awkward when you have to offer your pair to one of your guests and then they know you are sitting there watching a blurry picture.

"Nice and simple pot. Has six hour timer, however, would like to have a longer delay for the day use. Also, when using the timer, it always resets the final temperature to 190 degree. Would be nice if it can ""remember"" the previous temperature setting. The inner container is coated with floury charcoal, not teflon coating that any other brands offer. It claims to bring out the fine taste of water. To me, at least it looks better than the grey teflon coating. Another feature missing is it does not come with the audible alarm.

Extra spec that I would like to know before ordering:
Power: 700 Watt
Temp setting: 140, 180, 190, 208
No audible alarm for any events.

Turning the other computer into an extended monitor is really neat and very helpful when I need a third screen for work.

"I'm spending $22 on a chinese made medium sized microfiber towel because I'm about to start camping and be on the go and I want something that will dry quickly.  I could go to walmart and get a cotton blend towel for $3.00  It said to WASH the (blue) towel first as it 'could' bleed so I washed it in my sink and YES, it bleed everywhere...no harm done.

Why?  Because they aren't washing them in china, saves money and a step in the process = more profit for Sea to Summit.  Well, fine it doesn't bother me that much that I need to hand wash the towel.  It is amazingly SOFT and it comes with a cheesy mesh bag and has a cool snap loop to hang it, all great.

"Again, this  is a product I've been using for several months now, and I feel qualified to give a fair review.

It does the job... period.  You can adjust it to be stable as you ride.  Of course, a rough bump may knock it out of line, but you simply reach up and align it.  If you're a rough rider and go across terrain, very few mirrors will remain stationary unless you crank it down.  But you don't want this mirror too tight because if something smacks it (often your own arm or hand), you WANT it to move freely enough that it doesn't snap off.  ...and it WILL get smacked around a bit.

After a whole lotta knocks and clipping a few things while riding (it increases your handlebar span by 3/4""), the worst that has happened has been the durable plastic mirror popping out of the casing...maybe twice.  No problem... it pops right back in and is no worse for wear.

If it ever does meet with a fatal incident, I will surely buy another to replace it.  I will also be putting them on my future custom builds.  Great mirror, and nice looks too.",5.0,0

The drive is also very loud and seems to be very portable.  The TRS-80 has a magnetic feature and the TRS-80 has a feature on the left that makes it easier to use the keyboard.  I have not tried it with the TRS-80 and I have no idea what they have in store for it.

It is a nice size and well made.  I would not hesitate to buy this again if I could.  It has a lot of features and it is very well made.

I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a portable keyboard for typing on a computer.

I would also recommend this keyboard to someone who has a keyboard that doesn't have a hard drive in it.I had a little trouble getting it to work. It works perfectly, but if you are a beginner, you'll have to spend a little more money.

Assembly was just three poles that easily slipped into metal rings at each end and took maybe 5 minutes to assemble.

"An oven mitt isn't really the kind of thing I put a lot of thought into, but in using this one, I've quickly come to appreciate the difference between an afterthought and an item borne of deliberate design.

I got this to replace a potholder I'd used for years, and I immediately appreciated the advantage of not having to worry about dropping it or slipping my grip. The design allots plenty of hand flexibility, and this is especially noticeable in the thumb area- All-clad promotes the thumb design on this product, and with good reason, as it allows total flexibility, which is crucial when handling hot pans and pots.

The craftsmanship is first-rate, and the grip and insulation are good- I never felt like I had a weak or unsteady hold on anything, and my hand never got warm, much less hot.

An oven mitt is a utility item that gets used daily; to my way of thinking, paying a bit more for an exponentially higher-quality mitt is an obviously good investment.",5.0,0
"The cheapest place that I found this was in Bed Bath and Beyond and this was on top of using the 20% coupon. That being said, this is not worth the price that was paid for it. ( hubby paid for it). With tax it came out to $87.09 This is definitely overpriced. I can see spending maybe $50.00 but no more than that. Unfortunately no one is selling it for less than what it cost, unless it's a used item.

This was bought so I could work on my Abs. That being said, this is not the most comfortable piece of equipment to use to do situps. Yes it helps with your neck and not straining it as you come up from doing a ""situp"" but if you have lower back issues, this will not help you. ....If anything , it'll make your lower back much worse. So I wouldn't recommend this if you have back issues.

I've been using this religiously for the past 3 months and only have 15% bodyfat ( female) and I don't see any ABs. My diet is pretty good ( fruits vegetables lean meats etc) but still no sign of any ABs . Unless I'm supposed to have lower bodyfat which I refuse to go lower than 15% to get these ABs then this thing is just not going to work for me. Lower bodyfat is not the answer for me- to many health risks involved with that.
 I'll give it another month and if I see no signs of ABS then this will be going back to the store.",1.0,0

In frustration, I came back to the cassette adapter concept. Thanks to a previous reviewer who mentioned that this adapter works with GM factory cassette decks and others won't. I purchased this adapter and the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Griffin-9749-PJBLK-PowerJolt-Auto-Charger-for-iPod-Black/dp/B000FIQC5E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Griffin 9749-PJBLK PowerJolt Auto Charger for iPod (Black)</a>&nbsp;and it's a near-perfect solution for me. There's one more wire to deal with, but the sound quality (no static, no auto shutoff) is worth it.

Update 3/28/09: After about a year and a half of occasional usage, the tape deck stopped liking the adapter. It would try to change sides a couple of times and then eject the adapter. Maybe something wore out? I purchased a replacement unit and it works fine, so it wasn't the deck. Someday I'll own a car with an iPod port...

Update 12/8/09: The second one stopped working last month--that is to say, the tape deck started rejecting it. Eight months of very occasional use? I would really like to know what part is wearing down and causing this. I purchased another new one and we'll see how long that one lasts. If this one doesn't work out, maybe I'll just go buy a handful of cheap ones at the 99 Cents Only store.

Update 1/24/10: The third one stopped working, but I don't think it's the adapter; I think it's my cassette deck. So I can't really blame the adapter. I purchased an inexpensive FM transmitter (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Apple-iPod-FM-Transmitter-Car-Kit/dp/B002US9SSK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Apple iPod FM Transmitter Car Kit</a>) and it works great so far, with a lot less frustration.",5.0,0

The only issue I have is that it is using a lot of detergent. After reading online if this is an issue, someone gave a really good idea. Just plain water in wash mode first. Then wash mode with detergent/solution. Then rinse.
 It seems more work but worth it. Just washing with water took out some of the dirt already. Then with detergent, the dirt were basically ready to come out. I rinse the carpet twice just to be sure it is soap free.

"These heavy duty, kitchen scissors have many functions but if you have arthritis in your fingers the handles are a wee bit too tight. And, I was surprised that the scissors aren't quite sharp enough. The scissors come with a magnetic sheath which I attach to the side of my refrigerator. However, the magnet isn't quite strong enough & when I put the scissors in, everything slides down a little bit then stops. Because the magnet isn't strong enough, it works better on the side of the fridge rather than on the door where opening/closing the door constantly jars it. **The scissors have many functions:
They come apart & can be used separately for slicing. At the top of one handle is a bottle opener. The top of the other handle can be used as a screw driver. With the blades joined you can open jar lids or crack nuts between the handles. One blade doubles as a vegetable peeler. The other blade's serrated edge can be used to scale fish.",3.0,0

"So far I've put up 4 of the cameras, and it works pretty well. The picture on the monitor is of good quality, both night and day. I've been very impressed by the quality of night vision through these cams.

When I'm at home and my phone is connected to the home wifi, I can see the cams (both the grid, and each individual cam) on my phone just fine. I have NEVER, however, been able to access these images remotely, as was claimed in the description. (At LEAST one star off for that, as that's one of the main things I wanted to be able to do.) If somebody helps me be able to do that, I'll be glad to add back at least another star.

At least one of the cables failed, which MAY have been partly my fault, but it just seems like they're pretty brittle and easily damaged. (Maybe really thin wire? Not sure.)

I added a 2TB surveillance hard drive, and getting all of that hooked up was rather simple - no problems there.

I was able to go rewind and see who got into my garage trash can (neighborhood stray dog), and we feel like just having the cams up is deterring whomever MIGHT have been getting stuff out of our garage freezer.

"This is one of the few times amazon reviews have let me down. I bought this to have on hand whenever I made my own dressings or sauces that might be used over the course of a few days. My bottle got pushed towards the back of the cupboard and I forgot about it, until I moved and decided I should make use of it since I finally had space for everything.

The first time I went to use it, however, liquid droplets went flying everywhere with the first few shakes! I thought maybe the lid wasn't tight enough, but it still leaked. I held down the flip cap, but still wound up with ingredients running down my arm. It was such a disappointing mess, and the bottle wouldn't exactly look right or be any more functional than any other bottle sans crappy screwtop that I just threw it away (a rarity for me, since I hate throwing away things.)

I was pretty shocked at how useless it was since I remembered the glowing reviews my fellow Amazonians had given it, and because I have other Norpro products that are fairly above-average in terms of functionality and usefulness.

The bottle's looks were pretty plain and utilitarian but I'd overlooked that for the sake of function, but now I think next time I'd prefer a prettier bottle even if it doesn't have useful features like a screw-on lid or flip top cap, since they could likely just be made of fail anyway.",2.0,0
"This is a great set of DVDs. Also comes with a booklet with a nutrition plan and the workout schedule based on your goals (lean, standard, etc.) I have been working out at home for years but I get bored easily. This is something different every time, and it's only 30 minutes so I tend to not skip it. MMX is my favorite, all the punching and kicking make the time fly by. With almost all the workouts, I am working up a sweat by about the 10 minute mark.

I know the big question is results. I am not using these workouts the way they were designed -- I didn't do the fitness test or take measurements or photos before starting. I don't work out every night. I work out about 4 - 5 nights a week, and then do whichever is the next workout on the schedule. I am in my mid-40's and know my limits, so I modify a fair amount of the time. About the same time I started these I also started Weight Watchers, so I follow that instead of the nutrition program included with the DVDs. I am in the middle of week 9 of the workouts (on the ""lean"" program), have lost about 10 pounds, and on a regular basis coworkers and neighbors have been asking if I've lost weight. When I finish the program I have no doubt that most of the workouts will have a regular rotation in my workout routine.

I highly recommend this program. Great workouts, great production values, and mildly entertaining to boot.",5.0,0
"I have not yet shot with this scope, NOT YET MOUNTED.  1)  It took over 4 weeks to receive it from time of ordering.  2)  The whole scope was covered with dust.  3)  The objective lens had smear marks on it but cleaned with a microfiber cloth alright.  4)  When I took the lens caps off after the 4 day return policy had expired, much to my surprise I discovered that the objective lens tube AT THE END was FLAT for about 2 inches instead of round.  The tube is NOT flat anywhere at the objective lens itself, but at the end of the scope.

"Paid 206 dollars for this black, with butcher block top, Dolly Madison Kitchen Cart at Amazon.  I actually bought two of them.  For the price they deserve 5 stars but they were not perfect.  They came boxed nicely with lots of foam but the top and bottom pieces of one unit had damage (minor) on one corner.  Problem is the damage had to have been done pre-packaging which means someone dropped it and still packed it up for shipping. Also, there was one internal nut missing from the same spot on both units.  I was able to Jerry rig it by inserting a small wood dowel into the holes to hold them together.  Also, that same hole on one unit was too small to plug with the finishing plugs. Directions were not so great but I had no trouble assembling them with the help of my daughter.  It took us almost 4 hours to do the first one, counting rounding up the necessary tools and getting all the parts out of the box.  We were able to whip the second one together in only an hour. I am very pleased with the quality of these.  The backs are made of wood panels and slats and looks good from behind, the drawers glide nice and the magnets on the cabinet doors are strong.

"5 stars for customer service! Like many other reviewers on this product, the battery from Anker lasts about 7-8 months before the battery starts to swell up and making the mouse track un-clickable and the battery drains out in under 35 minutes. I contacted AnkerDirect recently through their seller page and told them about my battery issue. They asked for pics of the the battery and sent me a return label to mail in the old battery for a replacement covered under the warranty. Easy Peasy. If only all companies were this awesome. I would deal with AnkerDirect again in a heartbeat.

Now for the product itself...4 stars. I have a mid 2010 macbook, and its basically been hanging onto its electronic life by a thread. When I had to replace the original battery that came with my macbook, I didn't want to invest in a Apple battery because I wanted to only squeeze out another 18 months with my mac before upgrading to a new laptop. So this was the way to go for me, especially with the warranty. After installing, it worked great and held a charge for a good 2-3.5 hours depending on how many apps/windows were open until around the 7 month of use. If purchasing this battery keep in mind that there is a chance that you will have to replace it within a year through the warranty. If it's not a big deal to you, don't hesitate and get this battery.",4.0,0

"So far I'm really liking this hard case. I got it for my AK-47. I initially was looking for a soft case in the 25 to 35 dollar range,  but had trouble finding one that could hold the long 30 round AK mags in their pouches. I opted for this case instead and was pleasantly surprised to find that I can fit my rifle with scope and a magazine inserted into it's well. As my picture shows, there is room for extra mags also.
One thing that I like is that when it's closed, the soft foam really compresses around the rifle and holds it in place. I have shook the case and swung it around and upon reopening it, everything was still in the the original positions that I had placed them in. You also get nylon straps that you can screw into the case with the provided screws to secure your rifle. Honestly, I don't think that i will put them in because  of the aforementioned reason,  although it certainly wouldn't hurt.
There are four plastic locking tabs that keep the case closed and there are also places to put pad locks on if one should choose to.
Overall, pleased with this case as it serves my purposes.",5.0,0

"These are heavy duty tubes. I did not expect them to be as thick as they are and I mean they are thick. I installed these tubes on two of my bikes so far but haven't had a chance to go for a long ride yet. But I didn't have any problems with installation. I removed the original tubes and installed these and I used one of the ORIGINAL tubes as a spare in case I do have a flat. I would not use one of these as a spare as they are about the weight of three regular tubes combined.

 I have a Burley trailer that uses 20x1.75 tubes and even ordered tubes for it as I don't want any flats. And even if I do these are so thick that I could probably run the tires flat and still keep going.

I was leary about ordering these at first but at this time I am very please with this product. Just take your time and make sure that the tire seats itself properly on the rim and I would recommend these to others and I will also update my review of them after I get some miles on these tubes.

Since these tubes are so thick and heavy it might take some more effort to pedal because of the rotational force that is involved. I don't think I would use these on my road bike because of that. But for the commuter bike that I plan on riding to work (7 miles one way) or the bike for pulling by trailer it won't matter that much to me. I don't want to fix a flat. If you are planning on riding a long distance (10 to 20 miles or more) stay with the lighter tubes and just carry a spare tube in case you have a flat.",5.0,0

"Got this product to do our upstairs (only area that is carpeted in our home). Ordered on sale, and got the item promptly through Amazon. Fast forward to 4 months later (we never took it out of the box) and opened it to get to work since we were expecting company. Instructions were horrendous, but finally got the thing put together. My husband and I couldn't figure out why the vac was not standing upright on its own, but kept falling backwards. Figured something must be missing and/or not put together properly. We dumped the Hoover box upside down in an effort to see if there were any missed parts and the only thing that fell out was a teeeeennnnyyyy tiny piece of plastic (think size of a marble). Turns out that little piece of plastic had a big job-it held up the ENTIRE machine. A bit stunned that some genius thought plastic would be good to use for such a crucial part of the machine, I called Hoover expecting them to stand behind their ""One Year Warranty"" that the machine came with. Explained the situation to a Hoover rep who assured me that we could take it to an authorized Hoover store for free repair. I was also confident since the machine was not even used once that the Hoover store could verify that clearly this had not been our fault. Wrong again. We got a phone call 2 days later informing us that the plastic piece that was broken was NOT covered under warranty and it would cost $120.00 to fix. ARE YOU SERIOUS?!?? Oh yes, let's pay for a piece of (*#&(W*#&( machine twice. I think not. This has been the worst experience and I will NEVER purchase anything Hoover again.

"I bought small which fits perfect on my Glock 17. I also love that it's been used to hold my BAGs. The attachments to the pistol are tight so it won't slip off. I also like that the clip is very thick. This is an excellent product.I bought this to replace the one I had when I lost my phone and it was a little uncomfortable. I didn't want to spend the money for it and thought it was a waste of money. This is a great addition to my emergency kit. I will use it for my emergency kit. I have a spare battery so I can use this when I need it. I can't say enough good things about this product.I'm 5'4"" and 140lbs, and my boyfriend is 5'11"" and 180lbs.

"I was actually hoping to find something about half this size with the same purpose.  If I could find a wine rack that held 12 bottles and 8 glasses that would fit on my counter top, I would be ecstatic.  Unfortunately, I couldn't find anything like that.  And the two part accessories that provided that functionality would end up costing twice as much as this unit.  So after several weeks of debating and shopping, I finally decided on this one.  And I'm pretty happy.

First of all, it just looks awesome in the corner of my kitchen.  Plus, the extra counter top is a definite plus.  It is also very easy to put together.  It took me longer to get it out of the package than it actually took me to assemble.  But the biggest bonus is just how awesome it looks.  I can't emphasize that enough.

A few other reviews mentioned that it didn't hold many of the larger base wine glasses.  I utilize two different types of glasses, a rounded goblet for red wine and a taller glass for white wine (I don't drink sparkling wine...blech).  Both generic types of glasses fit perfectly.

My only complaint with this item is the fact that the legs were not perfectly alligned at first assembly.  If I had placed it on carpet, I would have never even noticed.  But it was on a flat, tile surface.  It wobbled just a little bit.  I suspected that this was the result of the torque put on the screws during assembly.  So I loosened all of the screws on the sides and then retightened them.  Problem solved.",5.0,0

"Thank you, Sunbeam for a great product!  It's not even technically winter yet, and we've already had bitter cold temperatures and lots of snow in northern NY.  We heat our home with a pellet stove which keeps the main part of the house very comfortable, but our bedroom is always cold. With winter arriving early, we decided to order the electric blanket.  It arrived exactly when it was supposed to and in perfect condition.  We put it on the bed immediately and turned it on high about a half hour before bed.  The bed was so warm and toasty when we got in.  On a 19 degree night we actually were able to get away with having the setting on low for the rest of the night.  It does have an auto shut off which is a very nice feature.  So you ask, why am I raving about this blanket and only giving it four stars?  I guess it's picky, but the dial on the controller is VERY hard to turn.  If you wake up in the night and want to adjust it, you have to really work at it.

"This is a fairly nifty multifunction gadget for any golfer, and would make a nice inexpensive gift. As a divot repair tool this is solidly built and works OK. It also has a magnetic ball marker that slides off when you press the bottom of it (it has a 19th hole logo, which you can have replaced with team logos or other options offered by the manufacturer). The top end features an indent to hold a club, just above the magnet designed to catch bottle caps pulled off by the bottle opener (flip it over to use as a can opener). The 6th use of this is to hold cigars, something I would not use myself but which I suppose some golfers may have use for. This tool is nice to have and it is solid, so it should offer many years of use as long as you don't lose it. The shiny gold finish may not last, but while it does it will make the tool stand out in the green. One thing I do suggest is that Amazon place this in the sporting category rather than home goods, where it is currently listed. While it opens bottles and cans, the main purpose is divot repair, which people would search for in sporting goods.",4.0,0

Yes, if you have delicate items like breads mixed with canned goods, you'll likely squish the bread as the bag doesn't have the stability of a paper bag, so things shift when you grab the handles.

I contacted the seller and was advised that they did it this way as a precaution so the poles will just fall out if you trip or something. I personally would have preferred that they lock in but they work the same as long as you don't trip. As noted the e-book gives you several set-up ideas to use for a variety of workouts.

"We got this to match my old Teflon stove set.  This is the first one we've had.  The plastic is solid and is easy to clean.  I used this to make a little homemade bread.  We used it for making homemade bread for two people.  We used it as a quick and easy way to make homemade bread for several people.  We made a lot of homemade bread and it was pretty easy.  I like that the bread is thick and it holds a lot of flour, so it's easy to make for our dinner guests.  We also used it to make a pasta dish for two people.  This is a very handy feature.  I like that it's a small and easy to carry to the counter to store for later use.  I also like that the bag holds a lot of flour so you don't have to worry about it spilling out the bag.  I also like that it doesn't come with a lid.  It's a little awkward to use but it works great for our needs.

"These screen protectors definitely do their job, as do most; however, I just can't seem to justify these for my Kindle Touch. (Especially in consideration of a few outstanding faults)

The most annoying aspect of this particular product was that it was not a very precise fit whatsoever. The Kindle Touch uses a good deal of perimeter screen area for display, which makes having nearly one centimeter clearance on each side of a centered screen protector application extremely annoying and difficult to overlook. If they were perfectly clear, it may be a little easier for others to overlook, but the translucence is ever so slightly different than the screen itself. I removed my screen protector immediately after application.

I must note that I often and gladly employ the use of screen protectors whenever reasonably applicable, particularly with touch screen cell phones, but when it comes to the Kindle Touch I'm not too sure if they truly serve any degree of necessary function at all. With most book-like e-reader covers (mine being the standard ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Amazon-Kindle-Touch-Leather-Cover-Black/dp/B004SD22PQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Amazon Kindle Touch Leather Cover, Black</a>"" - of which I am EXTREMELY happy with), the only time the screen is actually exposed would be when the Kindle is in use. In this case, the annoyance of a poorly fitting screen protector doesn't come close to outweighing the slim risk of anything happening to the screen in conjunction with a proper cover and/or case.

In summation: If you find that you need a screen protector and don't mind that it only covers 95% of the screen, then this product should certainly suffice - 3 stars for the sake of advertised purpose fulfillment.",3.0,0

"I normally use a Noizfree headset, which has stellar sound quality.

This one drops out the lower frequencies, and even the remaining ones just sound vastly off.. It's very hard to listen to music with this thing with all the distortion and missing frequencies.  Tried different levels of volume on both the unit and the phone.

Even plugging my noizfree set into the unit and bypassing the neckloop makes very little difference.  The neckloop is mono as expected, but the jack is stereo capable.

I suspect something is off with their bluetooth implementation.. it sounds like an AM radio.  Even given the limitations of Bluetooth audio, the unit itself feels and sounds cheap.

The volume control on the side is audibly noisy, when you change volumes you can hear it scratching.

"UPDATE #2: As promised, the vendor sent a replacement headset, which does seem to work better. I was also surprised to find this one fits better too as I did NOT expect that. The original headset seems to be too springy (not really a great way to describe it, but the best words I can come up with at the moment), so it is constantly pulling at my ears and coming loose even with slight movement. This one seems to a little loser, so it is more forgiving of head movement. SO, headset #2 seems to have addressed my two biggest complaints about the headset, so I am happy to upgrade the rating to 4 stars instead of the original 1 star rate. Kudos to Patozon for taking the time to make things right!

UPDATE: The vendor has reached out to me after this review and they are sending me a replacement headset which I think is awesome. I have bumped this up to a two stat based on the customer service. Once I get the headset, assuming there is improvement in their performance, maybe I can bump it up even higher.

I am surprised this headset is so highly rated. I find them to not fit very well and they are constantly falling out of my ears even with the proper ear piece size. That alone would not justify the 1 star rating, but combined with the low sound quality and awful Bluetooth connection, this headset is a huge disappointment. Using a Samsung Galaxy S6, any audio streamed to this device is choppy, in many cases beyond comprehension, unless the phone is about 2 inches from the heaset; even then, sometimes it still doesn't work. I do not have this same issue with other Bluetooth devices paired to this phone. Given the primary function of a headset is to play audio and the fact that this headset doesn't seem to be able to do so warrants a 1 star rating. Wish I knew why some many others have a different experience with this product.",4.0,0

"I purchased this watch for my wife almost two years ago. She wore it very rarely, as a ""vacation watch"" when we went on vacations where we would be swimming or snorkeling. The watch's description on Amazon states: ""Water resistant to 100m (330ft): in general, suitable for swimming and snorkeling, but not diving."" On the second day of our most recent trip the watch stopped working, apparently due to water that had entered the display. My strong advice is to not purchase this watch if you plan to use it while snorkeling. Doing some additional research, I discovered that to really be considered adequate for snorkeling, a watch should be rated to 200 M /  20 ATM. Watches, like this Timex, rated to 100 M /  10 ATM should be OK for light swimming, but not for snorkeling. Whatever we decide on as a replacement will be rated for 200 M / 20 ATM.

I have rated this watch two stars, instead of one star, because it did work for a while, looked good, was comfortable, etc., and because for light swimming only, it is probably fine.",2.0,0

"I used to be stuck on Kershaw and CRKT for folding knives, but once I started looking for ""larger"" folding knives - I had to turn elsewhere.

Enter Cold Steel. The Voyager is a GREAT heavy duty folder. I'll make this simple and quick - you get all the blade quality and blade size with NONE of the weight and the ridiculously large handles that some companies put out.

The Large Voyager gives you a solid 4"" blade of nicely crafted AUS-8 stainless steel. I used to hate knives with the lock on the back of the handles. Cold Steel has changed that. I now LOVE them, those tri-ad locks are the best! Tougher than old leather, but not impossible to manipulate. I can open and close my Voyager easily with one hand, but I'm not supremely confident when I have the blade locked into position and ready for a tough task. As much as I like my other folders, even the ones with good liner locks....I can't say the same of them for some tasks.

Another note on the handles - they have good texture. It's aggressive, but not bitingly so. Are they thin? Yes, but they're tough. They're also comfortable, having the right grooves in the right places, allowing you good purchase on the knife, regardless of your hand size, I'm thinking.

"The 2 gig version of this HD 6450 was only $10 more than the 1 gig version. A deal! I do not game, so I have no need for a super OC card. I do use CPU hogging music software and I just want a graphics card that can stay of the busses as much as possible and run without any CPU support. Also, a fan is a big no-no.

There was some driver problems with the Fuel. Service.exe file, which seems to be used only when the card is in Turbo-mode. I turned off the Turbo and stopped the Fuel file from running with MSConfig and that seemed to work. I just installed newly available Catalyst driver/software. Will see what happens next... I haven't had to turn off the Fuel ... yet.

AMD's software is very well conceived and easy to use, with one exception: I am using the HDMI port at times for viewing HULU on my LCD-TV as well as dual displays. There was adequate info on how to set up a dual display system, but absolutely nothing on how to use the HDMI port. Clue: Detect the HDMI first, then set up a preset. After you get all this figured out, you will see the beauty of having many presets to suit any need. The software is quite versatile. Just run the software, select a preset, and voila! New and varied display/graphics setups with different characteristics and functions to suit your software needs.

My last card was an NVIDIA based PNY. It was defective, registered, under warranty, and PNY did not want to give me a new card without my sending them the defective one first, meaning BIG downtime for me (shame on them... I'll never buy another PNY product again). I bought this XFX 6450 instead and I am glad I did. It is without question a much better card. Well worth the $$ !! Buy one!!",5.0,0

"Pros:
Casters can be removed and stored within the bottom of the unit, securely for storage.
Cord has storage compartment with a closing door, which latches securely.
Four Heat settings.
Silent.
Highly Effective.

Cons:
Documentation is a little dated, refers to the switches on the unit being a rotary type dial control.

While the product description does mention a circulation fan, I don't see one - and frankly I'm glad it doesn't seem to have one.  It's silent, totally silent.  Setting switch 3 (Bottom Element) to ON (375 Watts), more than ample to heat my entire upstairs.  A pleasant slow event heat.

The product isn't UL listed, but it is ETL listed.  There is an overheat circuit interrupt with a button on the back of the unit, and sensitive tip over cut-off switch.  Very pleased with the safety of the unit overall.

The unit functions in two ways, first is the reflective heat you can see and feel when the unit is ON; it feels like warm sunshine.  Second, it functions as a convection heater; air passes through from the cold floor up through the unit and is released via a grill on the top of the unit.

Switch Layout:
Switch 3 - Bottom Element
Switch 2 - Top Two Elements
Switch 1 - Second From Bottom Element

Dial:
No temperature markings, does have a very wide travel path; so accurate temperature control is very easy.

Most heaters of this type are two settings only, ~1000 Watt, and ~1500 Watt.  This results in good warmth, but results in the area in front of the unit being warmer than the rest of the room.

When I purchased, there were only two reviews on this unit.  One review was particularly harsh and gave a One-Star due to the misprint about the fan. I decided to take the plunge and buy the heater anyway; very glad for my decision to buy.",5.0,0

In addition the LCD screen folder out and rotates270 degrees which is a very handy feature.  If you want a smaller 4/3 camera and are happy with just the LCD (no viewfinder) the Olympus may be a bit better camera.  The G-3 is much much lighter and smaller than my Canon 5D.

"I really looked forward to getting these having read the reviews but so far have found them awkward in the following ways:
1. The fenders tend to warp easily meaning that if they follow the cross-section curvature at the brake end, they will be way off center at the mud flap end.  You can do a limited amount of adjusting but so far I haven't managed to get it quite right
2. Creep - be careful and don't try to get them too close to the tire - no closer than 3/8ths of an inch, otherwise with vibration the forward end of the blade will creep down towards the tire and several times I have caught it between the tire and the brakes.  I would recommend keeping the blade about 3/4 of an inch from the rear brake.
3. I use these only occasionally - in Colorado we don't have much rain, so they are on and off, mainly during the winter - they are easy to install, but I do seem to have to spend a lot of time aligning them properly.  Might be easier for someone who leaves them on for longer periods - I don't know.

"I give this 2 stars as I am not just throwing it out.

What I wish someone told me before I wasted $9.95 on this:

It is small enough but for it's size the level of light is very poor. To give you something to compare it to, If I need more light I would prefer the flashing light app on my iPhone, that is brighter.

So what is this good for? If I need a little night lite I can turn this on and not worry about waking up my wife where my iPhone may be a little too bright.

I does serve a purpose, I am rating low because it does not serve the purpose for which I purchased it and wish someone else posted this over the 5 star reviews I read. Maybe they used to be brighter and better but in January 2015 this is little more than a child's toy.",2.0,0

"Let me say up front that I bought the 76cs almost exclusively for marine navigation. It is a great little GPS for that purpose and I'm sure it's equally good for hiking. There are a lot better choices for auto navigation but I'm totally happy with it for my purpose. I was initially quite skeptical that a handheld's small screen real estate could be useful as a chart plotter. Nonetheless, I purchased and installed the Blue Chart Americas CD and activated the Caribbean charts. After 2 weeks of constant use sailing in the Windward Islands, I'm astounded at how well it works. With the 'declutter' mode engaged, the screens show an appropriate level of detail and the display has excellent visibility in direct sun. Although the backlight is adequate for viewing in bright conditions under a boat's bimini, I found that I actually preferred to hold it out in the direct sunlight. I particularly like the ability to customize the paging sequence and the autozoom feature is handy as well. There is nothing intuitive about the interface but after I got over the learning curve, I was surprised how quickly I could get to the info I needed. Entering lat/lon waypoints is never going to be fun without a keyboard, but is certainly manageable. If you plan ahead, you can enter them on a PC and download them. A storage card slot would be nice but the entire Caribbean chart set used less than 1/4 of the available memory and on the plus side the unit really is waterproof. The battery life is about as advertised and you can really stretch it by turning it off and on as you need it because it gets a fix in about 15 seconds if you haven't moved too far.",4.0,0

"I got these because they look great, like equipment you might find on the spaceship in 2001: A space Odyssey.  I was tempted to keep them just for that. The problem is that I don't like using them.

For this price I didn't expect them to sound great, and they don't, but they are good enough for audio books and podcasts. Turns out they are uncomfortable for me. I think they could be comfortable with velour pads instead of the synthetic leatherette material. I think the leatherette material is meant to provide sound isolation, but in fact these headphones offer no appreciable sound isolation.

The biggest problem is the severe cord noise. I hear this noise even with small head movements. Heretofore, I had heard this kind of noise only with earphones (in-ear monitors), never with headphones. It's strange that only one other reviewer has complained about the cord noise with these headphones.

I might add that these headphones are larger than they look in the photo. They are large enough that I'd almost call them clunky. They are much larger than the better-sounding Sennheiser PX100, which are my favorites in lightweight portable supra-aural headphones.

"I practice and teach olympic lifting, and I put these through the paces yesterday doing snatches and handstands - two movements where my wrists feel weakest. Out of the package, these felt really high quality, and they didn't disappoint during the actual use either. They provide a good amount of support without limiting natural movement. The construction is excellent and the material feels sturdy and exactly what I expect from good wraps. The seams are well done, the velcro is strong, both wrist wraps are the same length and everything is even and exact. The elasticity is good - just enough give to be able to tighten well, but not cut off circulation. I have small wrists, and the 12"" fit me. Like most wrist wraps that I've used, these are made to wrap twice around the wrists. This was plenty of support for me on handstands and snatches both, and the wraps didn't feel bulky or limiting. For my smaller hands, the thumb loop is the exact right length to guide the placement of the wraps.

Overall, very happy with these and will be using them almost every day. For anyone new to using wraps, prepare to love having pain-free wrists. I recommend airing all workout accessories after every use, and washing often, to ensure everything stays clean and smelling nice.

"For background, by trade I'm a professional mechanic, so I'm able to follow directions fairly easily.  This had myself and my father scratching our heads quite a bit.  The directions clearly tell you to put the ""height adjustment"" sticker on the WRONG side of the pole.  Also, installing the ""adjustment shock"" is fairly complicated and we ended up with the orange 'boot' upside down, despite several minutes of brain storming trying to interpret the directions.  They are written with a picture illustrating the overall goal of that particular step, with one line (presumably the most important note) describing what should have happened once you completed the step.  For example, instead of saying ""Install bolt (A) through pole and backboard, then use washer (B) and nut (C)"" the direction will have a picture of how those parts go together (you figure out where the picture is talking about) with note saying ""Ensure (C) goes on left side.""  Seriously.

Secondly, don't be fooled, this is a PLASTIC backboard, despite how the picture looks and how the description cleverly talks about it being shatter proof.  It is NOT glass, and it WILL respond as a plastic backboard does when a ball hits it.  Also, I've had it installed for just over 1 month now, and the rim is already starting to squeak/creak when a basket is made.

"Bought The Satechi SD Mini & the X-Mini Happy from Amazon.

The X-Mini Happy was $28 more (at the time)
and also came with a 2GB SD Card (mini with adapter)
plus Earphones (Plug Type).

Both came with a Pull String Carry Sack.

I loaded 2 SD cards with the same MP3s,
synchronized the start as best as possible,
and compared the sound of each using the respective Mute Buttons.

No Doubt About It: the X-Mini Happy had a Better Sound.

The SD Mini sounded OK until it was being compared to the X-Mini Happy.

The X-Mini Happy seemed to have a Fuller Sound -
Particularly with the Classical Music
(Amazon's: 99 Most Essential Masterpieces of the Classical Era).

But if you don't want to spend the Extra Bucks for the X-Mini Happy,
you won't be Sad with the SD Mini.

Also, the Earphones included with the Happy are OK,
but when compared with the
""Monster Turbine High-Performance In-Ear Speakers"",
they were Sadly, Quite Inferior.
But this might have been an Unfair Comparison.",3.0,0

It burns cleanly and evenly from one side of the container to the other.  It doesn't have the best reach like a $60+ candle, but it's better than cheaper candles, and worth it for the pleasant scent.  If you're in the same room you can definitely smell it.

"I really liked this knife when I first got it.  Pro:  It was my first spring assisted blade and I really enjoyed it.  Fast to open, with practice you can operate with only one hand (open and close), I like the feel in the hand and in the pocket with the provided clip, and I like the construction of the handle.  Very sturdy and has good texture to keep it secure in the hand.

Con:  Steel did not keep much of an edge.  Too much of the edge is wasted on serration (I know this is easily discernible from the picture but in the field I only used the serrated section once.  Usually it just got in the way).  Too much play in the blade.  Others have mentioned this in their reviews.  But even after tightened there was a little play and it seemed to get loose pretty easily.  But the thing that really bothered me is that the spring (as in the one that assists in opening) broke.  And since that happened, the lock does not stay engaged either (I assume that they are connected).  So now this thing is going in the trash.  The blade literally just flops back and fourth.  I do not even trust it to use as a tool in the always open position because the lock is unreliable.  Long story short, save your money, and buy a better knife.  I thought Gerber was good quality.  At least they seemed to be when I was growing up.  But I will probably not own another one.  Life expectancy should be more than a year an a half.  EDC tools should be more reliable.  My EDC of choice now is a Spyderco Endura 4 Wave that I also bought from Amazon.  Will post a detailed review of that soon.",2.0,0

"The 810 is an awesome case don't get me wrong. I really like it and am glad I picked this case after doing some research. I gave it 3 stars because there were a few things wrong with the case I noticed while re-assembling my PC. First there were a few blemishes on the paint, not horrible but still noticeable. The paint itself seems like it could get damaged pretty easy. Second, a section were the PSU is mounted was bent, but it didn't hinder the installation, just a little OCD kicking in. Third, the LED light in the back doesn't work (not sure if i missed a plug or anything) so there's that. Fourth, the fan's are nosier than I expected but that's remedied with a fan controller.

All in all the case is still great and is a huge upgrade from an Antec 900. But the 810 did come with a few unexpected imperfections. Not sure if it's because I purchased my antec from newegg and the 810 from Amazon but the antec was in pristine condition even though it arrived in a beat up box. Expected the 810 to have nothing wrong since the box seemed pretty mint, but i was mistaken.

I understand stuff like this happens, but for $170 this case should have nothing wrong with it. As a side note the case is packaged in a semi-soft foam, which was partially destroyed upon opening the box.

Hopefully there is nothing else wrong with the case.

"I really enjoy these cups.  Having 18/8 stainless (18% chromium and 8% nickel) means that these cups are food grade and will resist any corrosion.  That being said, I have used these cups around the house and have also taken them rock climbing; here is my summary:

Pros:
-Durable: I dropped these cups on rocks and they don't dent and will barely scuff.  Because they aren't colored, if they do scuff you barely notice.
-18/8: I do not foresee these cups corroding in any way. Additionally, they do not impart much flavor to the drinks.
-Environmentally friendly: no need for plastic.
-Solid: these cups are built well and are not flimsy at all.  This means they set well on rocks and on counters.  I don't worry about spilling my drinks.
-Clean look: The cup itself has a nice simple look to it. The logo looks nice and is not obnoxious in any way.
-Stackable: Bringing 5 cups on a camping trip does not take much space.

Cons:
-Metal: Although this might sound silly, because they are steel, the heat (or chill) from the drink distributes evenly to the cup and eventually to your hand.  Thus, these are not ideal for hot drinks
-Expandability: I would really like to see options to expand the use of these cups to hot fluids.  A silicone lid and a sleeve would make this insulated, keeping hot drinks hot or cold drinks cold.  However, a can coozie (can cooler) works well to keep your hands from getting too hot or too cold.

"I am a writer, and the room where I work is always colder in winter than the rest of the house. I got tired of wrapping myself up like a Christmas present in order to keep warm while working. Heat Storm to the rescue!

Pros:
Wide stance and very stable - will not be knocked over if bumped accidentally.
LIghtweight, large handle on top - can be easily picked up and moved
Fan is relatively quiet, and not annoying
Has a high-power and low-power setting, so energy usage can be controlled (changes fan speed from high to low)
Comes pre-set at 70F, but the settings can be easily adjusted
Does not have a ""hot smell"" odor when in use (at least so far)
Best of all, it does indeed heat a fairly large room quickly and efficiently.  The manufacturer says it will heat up to 1000 square feet.  My room is larger than that, and it heats the area just fine.

Update:  The more I use this heater, the more I like it. Infrared heat is the same kind of heat we get from the sun. Instead of trying to heat the whole room, I now place the heater about six feet away from my work area, point it in the direction of my chair, and run it on the low power setting. The result is a gentle heat, much like sitting in a pool of sunshine on a beautiful spring day. Lovely.

Description of how an infrared heater works, from a commercial heater company (biosmart solutions):
""An infrared heater operates differently from a conventional space heater in that the infrared heat waves heat the body and objects of the room directly. The heat stays evenly distributed and the room retains the heat longer. In contrast, conventional heaters heat by first raising the temperature of the air within the room, which in turn heats you.""

Cons:
None so far

"I purchased this card as a last resort attempt to cure my wireless connection. We have a 2 family house with access points on the 1st and 2nd floor, it is not an overly large house but try as I might I could not get a consistent signal in parts of the house with the built in LAN card on my Gateway laptop. I moved the routers, tried different antennas, downloaded updated drivers, even bought a new router for downstairs, but would only get 1 or 2 bars in the living room, with multiple drops. As a last resort I thought, why not disable the on board wireless and try a wireless card?

My laptop does not have a PCMCIA card slot, so I was limited to wireless express. This was the least expensive card I could find.

All I can say is, it works great. No drops, strong signal even outside. For me this was a great purchase. On my Vista laptop I did not have to install any software it used the Windows software and was a turnkey fix.",5.0,0

The mids are what's really bad I think--they have a tin-can quality to them that's not pleasant or realistic. This is common in the Beats line, I think the Studios are slightly better but they have other issues. For the same price or less, you could get some really great headphones. Check out AKG's Q-701, or Sennheiser Amperiors, or Audio-Technica M50's, or Shure 840's. They're all much more realistic sounding with clearer mids, smooth highs, and tight realistic bass.

"This was my second waring blender. Previously, I had one that was a bit shorter. This one can fit a lot of liquid, but apparently it is not meant for crushing ice. Huh? It is a bar blender. What is it for then? I only found this out because when my husband accidentally broke ours by blending a few cubes of ice (along with milk, bananas, yogurt), we contacted waring to see if it was under warranty and if it could be replaced. The blender would turn on but the blade didn't seem to be spinning anymore. Waring asked if we had used ice in the blender ""because it wasn't designed to crush ice."" We explained that t had, but only a small amount. Long story short, waring offered a once in a blue moon replacement blender top, but ""just this time."" Two to 3 weeks later it had still not arrived. My husband contacted the lady to ask her if she had shipped the replacement, because we really just wanted to know if we needed to buy a new blender so we could make smoothies in the mornings again. The replacement blender is $60-100, depending on where you buy it, so yeah we were waiting for the free one. The blender finally arrived, after hassling the lady again. I stuck my hand in the box and hundreds of shard of glass sliced into my skin. So, that was nice. The blender had been barely bubble wrapped. We didn't bother requesting a new one, and bought an entirely different blender instead. We bought the Farberware 4-speed  digital blender for $40.00 and have been happilly blending ever since. I used to be a blender snob, but unless you are going to fork over the money for a BlendTec or Vitamix, or something along those lines, there is really no point to spend a lot. I'm sorry but if a waring blender can't make a semi-frozen smoothie, what can it do? Puree soups?",3.0,0

"Love these hangers! I've been trying to find kids size/baby size velvet hangers for a while now. Target (the store that has everything) didn't have them online nor in store. When I did find them in store, the value was overpriced for a pack of 5 or 10, but 30 of these hangers for $12 is such a good value! I rated this review 4 stars because the product isn't PERFECT (see images attached) which most AmazonBasics products I've bought, in the past have been. I compared the hangers to the original ""Delta Baby Hangers"" (white) my daughter has had since she was born as well as ""Kid Sized Hangers"" from Ikea (blue) just to show customers a better idea of the size. I was concerned they were going to be a lot bigger, but couldn't tell from most of the pictures. They are actually standard baby size so they can fit baby clothes just fine! I love the velvet because it prevents my daughters clothes from slipping off like traditional plastic hangers. There were a couple defects like several of the hooks broke off when I tried to straighten the hooks (they came uneven), but if you're like me and don't care about a couple defects, then for the value, they are worth purchasing. Quick summary,

PROS:
- Great value for the quality
- Standard ""baby size"", i.e. can fit baby clothes
- For the most part, good quality
- PRIME shipping!

CONS:
- Hooks aren't straight
- Several hangers broke straight out the package
- Not a varied color selection (BLACK / WHITE!!!!), the polka dot ones look kind of tacky

"I'll be honest, when I first saw the picture of these gloves, my husband and I shared a great laugh, as they looked so silly! But my laughter quickly turned to intrigue as I realized that this could be exactly what I've been looking for to clean my toddlers sippy cups! So I went ahead and ordered a pair and hoped for the best. I am happy to report that they have become my best friend in the kitchen! You see, sippy cups have all of these little crevices in the tops which traps milk particles, dishwasher residue, etc. Also, if you don't find a lost toddler cup in time, the dried up drink inside can prove to be a real pain to remove. Normally I wrap a soapy dishcloth around a butter knife and get in the crevices and deep into the cup that way. Well no more!! These gloves have eliminated so much work and so many dirty dishcloths for me! They fit just perfectly, and the fact that one is a regular glove allows for easy handling of dishes. The sponge side is what does the trick for the crevices and the bottom rims of the cups, and the scrubby side has made removing dried up milk and chocolate syrup a breeze! I wish someone had thought of these sooner ! 5 stars!!

"You know, I have invested in quite a few very expensive ear buds in the past.  They sounded great, but invariably broke.  One or the other ear bud would just stop working.  I primarily use them to listen to audiobooks at the gym - lifting weights and riding the stationary bike.  SoI was never especially tough on my phones.

I finally got tired of paying a lot of money for products that weren't durable and didn't last. I bought these because they were inexpensive, and had a control on the cable to stop play if someone spoke to me.

Well, whaddah ya know!? They sounded almost as good, and they seem to be lasting longer.  This is actually my second pair.  I had bought them before, and was happy with them, but dropped my ipod one day and bent the phone plug.  After that, it didn't fit quite well, and I'd get static whenever I moved.  Bought a second pair, and they are great.

I use these with my iPhone as well on occasion, and they're fine for that use as well.  No one seems to have any problem hearing me, and I have no issue hearing and understanding them.  In fact, they sound quite good.

So, for either casual listening at the gym, or talking on your cell phone, I'd recommend these phones.  They are decent at excluding outside noise, though I haven't been able to get quite as good a fit as I had on some of the higher priced phones.  But I don't think the cost differential was anywhere near worth the slightly better sound isolation.",5.0,0
"This is a true ergonomic mouse. I work with computers for more than 10 hrs a day, previously I was using a logitech mouse but there was wrist pain which I started feeling.

I always keep it on, since it has auto off battery saving feature it runs good for more than 3 months with couple of AA batteries.

"I have spent considerable time reading the reviews and the instructions for how to make a dough dough, and I have found the best way to make a dough is to use a dough hook. The hook is made of a material that is thin enough to hold the dough to the edge of the dough hook. The dough hook is the most convenient way to use the dough hook. It has a very nice height for the dough hook to hang from and it is easy to hang when you are done. The dough hook is very easy to use. You can use it for a small batch of dough, or you can use it for more. The hook is not too big, but it is not too small either. The dough hook is also easy to clean.

"I bought this flashlight early december 2015. In recent months I've been using it at work and it has been dropped and tossed around in dusty crawl spaces. I wanted a flashlight that could use my old 18650 batteries that I won't use anymore for my e-cig.

Battery life seems alright. I pretty much always use the light on high and the 18650's i'm using are old and don't last nearly as long as it could with a fresh one. If you're battery is dying it will still allow you to use the low or medium brightness until it can't handle it anymore.

I've had this flashlight fall a few times with some falls taking little chunks of metal off it. I noticed other owners experiencing it not working after a drop. Luckily the one I have took the falls like a champ.

This flashlight is very bright. I'm not a flashlight enthusiast but when climbing into crawl spaces and peering through dark drop tile ceilings it really lights it up. I really like using the zoom feature when looking around. It will illuminate even the furthest darkest corner I would need it to.

Some cons for this light would be it can get hot quick depending on the temperature around you. The zoom markings are pretty silly and I don't think anyone uses it. The brightness and strobe settings are kind of annoying to deal with. If you skip the brightness you want you have to cycle it back again and if you turn the light off too quick it looses your setting.",5.0,0

"This is the first camera case I have ever bought so I don't have anything to compare it to.  As another reviewer mentioned, it is small inside unless you take out the divider. This case is meant for all S series cameras and I have an S700.  With the divider out there is plenty of room for the camera.

The top pocket inside the main case is mesh with a zipper closure, and the pocket on the front has room for two memory cards and an additional mesh pocket (no zipper, but the front pocket zips closed). The back of the case has a belt loop - though who could wear something this big on their hip?

I like that the case is not huge and bulky - fine for my needs, and it has a strong, detachable strap to carry over my shoulder.

Overall a good, well-made case that will last for a long time.",4.0,0

"I am a recent convert to ball whisks and I purchased one of these smaller ball whisks for doing smaller jobs in the kitchen when I don't need a bigger whisk. It has lived up to my expectations and sees very frequent use.

There are several different sizes of whisks and this is the smaller of the ball whisks. This is the wrong whisk when doing larger jobs such as mixing a batch of brownies but it's perfect for beating eggs, mixing drinks and similar small tasks. Because of the shape it is well-suited for getting down into the edges of a bowl or sauce pan, something that traditional wire balloon whisks cannot do.

This is a very stiff and sturdy utensil and it holds up well under heavy use. Even with smaller wire whisks I have struggled with the handles breaking off, mainly because of water getting into the spring-shaped handles and rusting the wires until they fatigue. The handle on this whisk is of a better design that keeps water out so that there's no rust problem. Also, the tines are made of stiff steel wire, much more sturdy than that of wire balloon whisks, so it holds up well under stress.

This is a great whisk for smaller jobs in the kitchen. It is well-made and well designed, and it should serve admirably for many years.",5.0,0

"I bought this unit a couple years ago, and it is great. I use it often (mostly streaming or playing off my phone or laptop). When plugged in to the AC adapter, it is plenty loud.

I've never tried to play a guitar through it, but I'm sure it would be fine if you don't get carried away. When it's running on battery power, it does get significantly quieter, but still decently loud. While heavy, the carry strap does make it easy to carry around with you. All in all, I'm not sure what all the bad reviews are about. The only thing I agree with, is the radio kinda sucks. No external antenna, so if the signal is weak it will be skipped over. There is also no fine tuning to the radio. If the station isn't strong, it will be skipped over. I rarely listen to radio, so it's not a big deal for me though.",5.0,0

"I have a 15-pound red kettlebell from GoFit.  At the time I am writing this review, you don't seem to be able to select that combination of options on Amazon, but that may change in the future as things come into and/or go out of stock.  And much of what I say will apply to any of the GoFit kettlebells that are currently being offered.

At any rate, I am very happy with this kettlebell.  It is comfortable to hold and I like the vinyl coating (not on the handle, just on the colored part as seen in the product images).  I have had my kettlebell for at least 5 or 6 years and have used it periodically and the coating does not seem to degrade.  It basically still looks the same as the day I got it.  I have not had any problems with this kettlebell slipping in my hands, either.

15 pounds is a little bit of a challenge for me and I can't use this kettlebell for every kettlebell exercise that I do.  I also have a smaller one for some exercises, and switch out as needed.  If you are planning to get into kettlebell training at a serious level, you will probably want to have a few kettlebells of different weights.  I find that a kettlebell workout works the legs more than you might expect (you don't notice it at the time but you feel it the next day).  For reference, if it helps in terms of selecting a kettlebell weight for you, I'm a small-framed woman in my mid-30s and I'd consider myself intermediate/advanced when it comes to most home exercise programs.

The DVD that came with this was not really a complete workout.  However, I thought the instructor (Sarah Lurie) was good and it motivated me to buy a couple of her full-length workout DVDs (many are available here on Amazon).",5.0,0

The design of it makes it very flexible allowing you to position your camera just about any way you can immagine.  It comes with a nice carry bag, its fairly light weight - without that cheap feeling to it, and it is very compact when fully collapsed.

I have not experienced any problems while using the tripod.  It is stable and there is no creep in the head when the camera is mount in any position.

I believe for many photographers this tripod would be more than suited for them.  While it looks like a well made tool, I'm not sure it would take much in the way of any abuse.  If you need something rugged, this may not be what you are looking for.

"Best machine for the money! This is our second Magnifica Super Automatic.  Our previous machine finally stopped being perfect after eight years of daily use (usually three or four uses per day).  The amount of money this machine has saved us over the past eight years is astonishing.  I prefer my homemade lattes to coffee shop lattes by a long shot.  Our guests always remember how fabulous our coffee is and request it if we don't offer!

It is absolutely super automatic.  You do have to clean it and add water after five or six double shots, but it is simple to do so.  You have to dump out the grinds from an easily removed container, pour out the excess water in the drip pan and fill up the water reservoir.  It usually takes about three minutes, tops, to complete this.  Once per month I gently wipe down the interior with a damp cloth and remove the grinder for a more thorough clean.  That process is about 5 minutes to complete.  The descaling happens once every four months or so (we have soft water so it doesn't get a lot of scale build up) and takes less than 30 minutes for the machine to do its thing.  Other than that, you just add beans and enjoy fabulous coffee.  Simple!  Simple!  Simple!

I was delighted that DeLonghi offered virtually the same machine now as it did eight years ago.  If it isn't broken, don't fix it!  We unpacked the box, followed the brief set up instructions and within 15 minutes were enjoying an excellent latte.

I can't recommend this machine enough for coffee lovers. It makes the best espresso shots anywhere (we love Lavazza espresso http://www.amazon.com/Lavazza-Super-Espresso-Coffee-2-2-Pound/dp/B000SDKDM4/ref=sr_1_2?s=home-garden&ie=UTF8&qid=1419869268&sr=1-2&keywords=lavazza+expresso), is easy to use and clean, and is a fabulous value.

"This is a pretty good little device, with lots of features.  There is a built-in WiFi and ethernet port, a built-in HDMI output, a micro USB port, and a HDMI port.  The only problem I had was that I had to plug in the HDMI port to the bottom of the device and it would not recognize the device.  After I plugged it in, it wouldn't recognize it.  The only reason I gave it 5 stars is that it was very easy to hook up the device.  I did get one lucky customer who just plugged in and it recognized it.  I have used it a couple of times and it has never stopped working.

"I have purchased six different brands, and models of 24 cup mini muffin pans.  I can't begin to tell you how many differences there are from pan to pan.

The reason I prefer this pan over others is that I bake mini brownies, cupcakes, carrot cakes and 'mini bite"" pastries of all kinds.  I use the fluted paper baking cups that measure 1-1/2"" X 1""
deep.  I use Reynolds brand, FC150x350 paper baking cups. the box says 3-1/2"" fluted cups, but that's the measurement before the cups are formed at the factory. *** Since the cups of this pan are only 3/4"" deep it allows the cakes and brownies to slightly ""flair out"" at the top; making them look larger than the ones made in deeper pans with the same 2"" diameter at the top.

I baked the identical pastries (half made in this pan, and others that were baked in the pans that were !"" deep). I offered them on trays set side by side, telling customers that they were ""IDENTICAL IN WEIGHT AND VOLUME"". Not one customer chose the pastries that were baked in the deeper pans. When you look at the finished product; made in this pan, it ""LOOKS"" and IS larger at the top!

I LOVE this pan, above any of the others and ""HIGHLY RECOMMEND"" it! The non-stick surface is outstanding too.

The Commercial II non-stick 24 cup mini- muffin pan measures 15-3/4"" by II""; each muffin measures 2"" in diameter and 3/4"" deep.

This clock is a really fun idea. The numbers do show up on the wall or ceiling as advertised. The color matched exactly as it shows.

Also it ruins strictly off of batteries. No wall plug provided. One thing I found interesting was if the table on which the clock is sitting is bumped the protection then turns on as well.

"I initially had high hopes for this product.  I have an HTPC with Windows Media Center that has built in Hauppauge tuners (one PCI single, 1500 series I think, and a dual PCIEx1 2250 model).  I was thinking that eventually, I'd be able to not be stuck with routing coax cables to the computer, and be able to access the tuner content over the network.  It worked pretty well for about 10 months.

The first one didn't work and after a hassle-free Amazon return, the second one broke after about 10 months.  The cooling fan stopped working and it was so hot to the touch, it was making my closet smell like burnt electronics.  I'm surprised it didn't catch on fire (not sure if it is UL listed or not.)  And like most warranties, you have to send it to the manufacturer and pay the shipping.  Yawn.  I guess I could have bought a new one and send the old one back, but that is somewhat unethical, and I didn't want to risk a house fire anyway, so at this point, I don't think you could pay me to take one.

The cooling fan in this unit is very loud, so it would need to be tucked away and not in the main viewing area.

On the other hand the Hauppauge tuners have performed flawlessly for probably about 5 years.  As a bonus, the Hauppauge also acts as my IR input to my computer which enables easy integration with Evenghost for automation with my Harmony remotes.  As a con, it seems the Hauppauge dual tuner has the worst signal, the single has slightly better, and the HDHomeRun had the best.  So if Hauppauge could better manage the ATSC signal in the tuner, there would be a clear winner there.  But even so, low heat, no noise, and flawless operation over 5 years is a large upside.

This is not a tactical vest for him, but it is well made and will help him to organize his gear.  The included pockets are nice and easy to access.  This vest is super lightweight and packs well in a small case.  It's great for his training and practice.  I would definitely recommend this to any tactical person.  Great product for a good price.  My husband also loves it.  I have used it for about a year and it still works perfectly.  It does not have the rust of a vest that I use for other vest",5.0,1

I was hesitant to buy these based on some of the reviews. I can say after using them numerous times I love them.

The cups are super simple to use and the eggs come out perfect every single time. Clean up is a snap. I highly recommend this product.,5.0,0

"I've been caught by the juicing bug, and I looked into which ones had the best performance. This one has been great, I've already made several gallons of juice from it in only a couple of days. It's relatively simple to dismantle and clean, plus it's dishwasher safe, so you can get it especially clean if you want to. I'm glad we went with the Breville. I can't think of anything about it that I would change. The base is solid, the whole mechanism snaps together tightly with the metal bar. The separation of juice from the pulp during operation is very effecient. Most of the pulp left over is dry, so you know you're getting your money's worth out of the produce you put into it.

Some people have complained that centrifugal juicers are bad at leafy greens, but I've done kale, spinach, and parsley, and I'm getting the amount of juice from them as I'd expect.",5.0,0

"After reading the reviews I purchased this with the expectation that the bag wouldn't attach quite right, and that's exactly what I found. While it certainly works, the design could be tweaked just a bit to greatly improve the usability. I will say that having my phone easily accessible right in front of me while riding is very handy. I was also pleasantly surprised by how well the touch screen works through the plastic.

At some point I will probably make some modifications so the bag fits snugly on the cross-tube. Right now the velcro straps are too long, and the bottom of the bag is flexible, so when you pull the straps tight it causes the bag to bend around that tube. Because the straps don't have the hook portion of the velcro covering the entire length, they barely attach. If there was a rounded rubber support on the backside that rested on top of the tube this would be perfect.

All in all, I would absolutely recommend this. For the price it's outstanding, functional, and useful. Would be 5-stars if just a bit more thought was put into the design.",4.0,0
"Well, I am a big fan of the wide-angle lenses.  These have a wide angle view and are not the best for most situations.  The plastic body makes it difficult to slip it in and out of the lens without damaging it.  This lens is excellent for those situations.  The 2.5x zoom is also fantastic.  The auto focus is so fast that it is very easy to pull off a few items and still get the focus down.  The zoom is also very good, although I have noticed that the zoom range is not as good as I hoped.  I am really impressed with this lens and recommend it to others.This is a very good sound system. I have been using it for about 3 years and I can tell you that it works perfectly. My only gripe is the battery life is not as good as my other speaker system.

Sense I bought these strictly for functionality, and not for their aesthetic appeal; and, being that they were $6.40 each, I am pleased with my purchase and will be keeping them.

"My late husband and I received this as a wedding gift in 2003. This coffee maker will grind beans, then brew, or you can just put ground coffee in it. For the most part, I just use ground coffee, but on occasion I'll buy whole bean coffee, and it works great. Some other reviewers have said that the grinding mechanism is loud, but I have a separate grinder, and it's no louder than that.

If you don't want to grind, just brew, there is a ""grind off"" button that you push before turning it on, and it just brews, without grinding- easy.

You can set it to make coffee at a pre-set time, and I've never had a problem with this- it's easy to set.

The coffee is brewed into a thermal carafe, and this works GREAT- my late husband would often get up around 6 am and brew a full pot. By the time I woke up at 8:30, it was still steaming hot, and no burned coffee from an under carafe heater.

The unit looks great and doesn't take up too much space on my counter.

The interior pieces come apart (basket, piece that holds the basket), and are easily washed in the top rack of the dishwasher.

Some people have complained in these reviews that they don't like the plastic insides, but I've had this machine for 4 years, and there's been no problem with anything breaking or malfunctioning in any way. There is also a mesh basket, which you can use as a filter, but if you remove it, you can  place a regular paper coffee filter in it's place.

I love that at parties, or on a nice day outside, I can place the carafe right on the table, and the coffee will stay hot for a long, long time.

I've had this machine for 4 years, and have been very happy with it. I've purchased several of them as gifts for people, as well- and everyone has loved it.",5.0,0

"After a total house remod was done I wanted to clean a few area rugs to get them looking decent prior to giving them away or selling them for a few bucks.  This particular area rug was kept in the house through tile removal dust, walls being torn down, construction workers, etc., it was filthy and I thought for sure it had stains that would not come out but boy was I wrong!  I could not believe how much dirt came out with this Hoover, much more than meets the eye so it definitely does a good deep cleaning.  I had to fill the water and solution containers and empty the extracted dirty water several times but it was worth the time and effort to get this rug clean, so much so that I've decided to keep this one as it almost looks new!  It's so nice to have a carpet cleaner in the house that I can just whip out when I have an extra hour to brighten up the rugs.  I always dreaded going to the store to rent one, lugging it home and back to the store when done.  This Hoover will pay for itself in a year.  In the first pic you can see how much cleaner the left strip of the rug is compared to the right side.  The 2nd pic was taken after I was done.
Pros:  It does a great job cleaning, better than I expected.  It's very easy to put together and use.  All the containers slip in and out of place with ease.  I like that the cord is not so long to where you have to carry it around or worry about it getting caught in the wheels.
Cons:  If your rugs are super dirty as this one was, be prepared to fill the water container and empty the dirty water many times.  This won't be an issue for maintenance once the first deep cleaning is done.",5.0,0

If you're looking to ride long distance get a better saddle with this bike purchase. I love how these pure fix cycles are so customizable! The accessories on the pure fix are fairly affordable. I'd grab the essentials ( i.e tools, spare tubes ) for the road. The frame is extremely light and strong. The bikes run true to your size. I enjoy the single gear over multiple gears.

"Buyer beware when use with some USB-C to USB-C cable, you might get speed capped 40MB/s:

----------------Apr 26 2016 Update----------------
I changed my review score to 5 to reflect the additional tests I've done to clarify the speed cap myth with Macbook.

After I consult with Apple forum, I get a answer that I might need a USB 3.0 USB-C to USB-c cable. So I did a search, and the ONLY cable mentioned USB 3.1 10Gb/s support is from Belkin:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Belkin-3-Foot-3-1-USB-Type-C-USB-C-to-USB-Type-C-Cable-USB-C-Certified/dp/B00WJSPCSG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Belkin 3-Foot 3.1 USB Type C (USB-C) to USB Type C Cable, USB-C Certified</a>&nbsp;And I tested with Macbook, it correctly recognized with USB 3.0 speed and pushed speed to it's limit. photo 7-8

So, in conclusion, If you want to achieve best performance with USB-C cable, make sure you have a USB-C cable support at least 5Gb/s transfer speed. And some cable like Apple's USB-C, Google's USB-C, Anker USB-C they only support 480Mb/s which is USB 2.0 standard for data transfer.

----------------Old Review----------------

I purchased it to used with my MacBook Retina 12' because of the USB-C support
But there is a real problem for this drive to use with USB-C to USB-C cable:

If you use it with Apple USB-C to USB-C cable, you only get USB 2.0 speed which is capped at 40MB/s in and out. Like the photo 1-3 show below.

If you use it with the accompany USB-A to USB-C cable you will have USB 3.0 speed which is 400MB/s in 425MB/s out. But the inconvenience part is for MacBook you have to use a USB-C to USB-A adapter like the photo 4-6 shows.

So in conclusion: if you purchased it for the USB-C convenience and universal support, you will disappointed with the speed seriously capped into USB 2.0 standard. For the best performance, you have to use the USB-A to USB-C cable, which will put it back to the same category of using a microUSB cable: you'll need adapter to make it work in full speed.",5.0,0

I've never owned a GPS before so I can't compare this product to others, but I was able to make good use of this unit within minutes of taking it out of the box.  The touch display and menu navigation are quite user friendly.  It took me a while to figure out the best settings, though. One thing to watch for is whether you are set for it to give the shortest route or the fastest route.  The shortest route will often take you on some pretty bizarre journeys, while fastest route will generally get you onto the major arteries and highways that you'll most likely want to use and remember.  Another thing it took me a while to realize is that you can change the default screen settings to tell you the direction of travel you are going in.  I find that more useful than displaying the time to my destination, which in my experience the device consistently underestimates.  Also not sure why they bothered to have the device tell you your speed, since cars already have speedometers.  Still, a very handy device that I now find almost indispensable.",5.0,0

This is my first ""swerve"" type vaccum so it took me a few days to understand how to make it go where I wanted it to go.  I also liked the fact it has a HEPA filter to prevent dust from escaping from the unit back into the room. It also comes with a very long cord, and the dirt canister or cup empties from the bottom into the trash, which seems to lead to less dust getting back into the air for us.  But there are some drawbacks.  There is no headlight or height adjustment feature and this unit is difficult to push over carpets. Clean any good size room with carpets and you will feel as if you have been at the gym doing push ups.  The unit does a great job on hardwood and tile floors however and I would certainly recommend it for that.  This unit is also relatively quiet compared to my other vacumms.  You can use it without waking up everybody in the house and I like that.  You can also detach the unit from its base and carry it to clean stairs, etc.  This is not a good unit to try and clean small area rugs however as the suction is too great and it simply picks up the rug.  The handle of the unit can be adjusted up or down to fit your desire and also lifts out.  When you lift out the handle, attach the hose to it and the provided attachment, you can use it to clean higher up areas like drapes or window sills.",4.0,0
"First impression: This is a tiny mesh bag, I bet they sent me the wrong size.

Then, once unfolded: This is a huge towel! Way bigger than a standard shower towel. Its about the size of a big beach towel. A BIG beach towel.
Then: It feels soft, but quite thin.
Then: Kind of an odd feel when you are toweling off (I used it after a swim)...in part because it lacks that certain degree of heft you have come to expect from a towel, and in part because it has a microfiber ""tackiness"" for lack of a better word. If you have ever dried your hands on a microfiber cloth, you know what I mean.

Finally: overall, it is a very absorbent, very soft, very well-made towel. Absolutely perfect for a gym bag because it packs down to the size of a water bottle.",5.0,0

"This is a nice little vacuum. The only problem is that it's not really a vacuum, but a pair of very small plastic bags.  The plastic bags are so small, it's difficult to get the vacuum in the right position.  If I had to pick up a lot of dirt, it would be a bit harder to get the vacuum in the right position.

"This is a really beautiful copper cup, all copper including the handle, with a logo printed (?) on the bottom. I love hammered copper normally, but the hammering on this copper is a bit different; it is VERY regular & even, and not fully hammered but rather the hammer marks just kind of go in rows, with spaces between each one, rather than the more standard all-over hammered look.  The overall impression at first is still similar, but it does have less of a fully hammered look than I had thought. Other than that, it is still a very nice cup, and makes a great addition to my little collection of mis-matched copper cups.

Also, it does not appear to be coated with anything, so that is as-advertised - nothing to flake off into my drinks, and it 'should' oxidize normally if I want to let it.

"As I have been replacing all of my outdated appliances, both small and large, with newer, faster, fancier models, I thought that this replacement for my 25-year old toaster would be ""the bomb"".

 Unfortunately I was to be disappointed. The ""forward-facing"" slots are convenient, and the little lever that allows you to lift your toast out when it is done are well-designed. The toaster sensitivity buttons allow for a range of settings (burnt-just warmed). There is a button for ""thawing"" but I have yet to see that it does anything other than toast the item inserted. The slots are wonderfully wide for even the largest bagel, yet accomodate regular bread well. The stay-cool to the touch outside is very nice.

 The problem? It toasts one side crispy, the other luke-warm. I find it necessary to switch slots and give it an extra few seconds (as the left slot cooks more on the right side, and the right slot cooks more on the left side).

 All in all this is just an expensive excuse for an regular toaster, and a mediocre one at that.",3.0,0

It's also made with an in-mold process where the shell is attached to the EPS in the tool.  One downside is that the helmet is really big - while you can adjust the internal strap so it doesn't wiggle as much fore/aft, there's more side to side movement than I would prefer for safety reasons.

For comparison, my Giro Atmos weighs 11.7.  The Atmos has an internal cage, however, with carbon fiber reinforcements.  It also meets CPSC.  CPSC is the certification required to sell a bicycle helmet in the US.  This helmet has CE EN1078 cerification, which means it meets the European standards and certification to be sold in Europe.

For a number of years I wanted to get a Catlike Whisper helmet after seeing it on Tour de France riders, but it wasn't CPSC so I couldn't buy it in the states.  Due to the lack of stringency in testing and certification, it seems that the higher end helmets - including Catlike- are now using the CPSC certification.

While this doesn't mean that this helmet is unsafe, it is accurate to say that a CPSC certified helmet is likely to protect you better in an accident.  I'm fine with using it for myself in some conditions, but if I'm going to ride in traffic, I'll probably still use my Atmos.

I consider myself more then just a novice when in comes to the ins and outs of installing hardware and software.  But this one has so far managed to elude me.  I have an Asus P6T v1 and needed the SATA III along with the RAID capability.  I might note that my MB has two onboard RAUD controllers one of which is in use.  After about 26hrs straight of messing around with this thing I am positive there is some setting that I can't find or change that allows me to have both the RAID card and the onboard RIAD running at the same time.  I was able to get the RAID card to install and even managed a RAID0 config with windows installed.  But for some reason I am no longer able to get back into that windows config.  So I am trying my hardest to see a point in keeping this harware.  Tech support at High Point seem to be unable to give me an answer as to what settings I should be shooting for in both of the BIOS for the MOBO and the card.

"Dell laptops are not as evil as the 3 lower comments make them seem.  It takes some basic user knowledge to get accustomed with the product.  There is no need to 'knock' Dell down because of a bad user experience.

Blue screens are usually caused by bad programming or writing of software.  Blue screens have codes that say ""error: xxx""  where XXX is the name and code of the problem.  MOST bluescreens are MEMORY PARITY problems -- bad programming of software.

Dell not responding to customer issues is absurd.  I have never had that experience in the 15 years I've been contacting Dell for any situation.

My suggestion to people who have ""so much trouble"" is to figure out why others do not.

"This bag is great. I have all kinds of bike bags because none really worked that well for my needs. They were either, two small or inconvenient to use.

"I was looking for something to protect my Kindle DX in transit. I decided I would rather just take the Kindle out to read than get the kind of case designed to hold the Kindle while you read. I use the Kindle mostly at home, so for most of the time I don't need a case, and when I do go somewhere with it, I can simply take it out of this case to use.

This case is ideal for my purposes. It is extremely light--3.5 ounces, according to the Amazon Product Details--and very well padded. It's easy to fit the Kindle in and take it out. The case seems well-made and sturdy. I would like it even better if it had a handle or strap, but that is not enough of a drawback to take away a star.

"So I have had this fan for a little over a week now. The thing to know about this is it does what it says! It is a swamp cooler that moves air through a wet pad. If you live somewhere that is dry and you know swamp coolers work in your region, then this will work.

My unit uses about a full tank of water every day and a half. I live in south central Texas. The only time I really can tell a difference in the air temperature is when I add ice to the water. This moves a lot of air and has many settings such as swing mode, high, medium, low, nature which alternates between the three, and a timer mode. You also have the option to turn the cooling on and off.

This fan does what it is advertised to do as long as you are using it in a dry climate. It moves a lot of air and could even be used as a humidifier.

UPDATE
I have now had this for about a month. I have taken great care of it. It literally was taken out of the box, placed in a corner on flat ground, and turned on and off each day. It worked well for the first month but it is now leaking! I am a handy person and I still can't figure out where the water is coming from. The water storage is in great condition so it has to be something with the hose line or water catching system from the wet pad. I can't figure out where it is coming from.

"I love good coffee and do not mind spending a little money to research different coffee making products. This does indeed brew some good coffee. Importantly, this device will keep that coffee fresh tasting for the two hours that I have it on the 'warm' setting. It is easy to fill and set up. It took me a few minutes to figure this thing out. I was used to the carafe brewers. Pros:
-On the 'bold' setting, it makes a good tasting brew. It keeps the coffee good tasting on the 'keep warm' function. -Easy fill, no spill. For filling the container or filling a cup. Cons:
-If you fill the internal water container over the 'marked' 12 cup line, the water will leak out a hole in the back. The next morning you may wonder why there is some water under the coffee maker. I did this a few times before I figured it out. Duh-ho! It looks like there is a lot more room in the container for the extra water, not so, too much water will drip out the back (unseen). -The bottom of the container is hard to clean, 8 plastic screw anchors, for the 'keep warm' plate, are on the bottom of the container. I like to use a soapy sponge to clean after use, the little things sticking out of the bottom make that harder than it should be. Overall: This is a good buy. I would not recommend it to a friend, unless, I first explained 'cleaning thing' mentioned above. If you love good tasting coffee, hey, buy it.",4.0,0

"I have always been fond of Roku and still use the first version they produced.

The setup is incredibly easy, though I don't understand how it would work without a computer.  The device upgrades itself fairly often, which is nice.  I can't believe how small this newest version is, but I like it.  I think it is similar in size to a full size computer mouse. I have no issues with video quality, with the exception of some bumpy Netflix experiences, but that's not a Roku issue.  I have convinced a few of my non-sports viewing friends to get rid of their cable completely and just use Roku.  Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Hulu Plus are my favorite channels, but I explore the other options every once in a while.  I don't use Pandora only because I don't have decent speakers on my television, but would certainly enjoy it if my sound situation improves.

"(review by my 14 yr old son): I love how the bow can change draw strengths. This allows me to progress to the full draw weight when I get stronger. I also love the bow's design and that I came with some powerful aluminum hunting arrows. I don't hunt but I do recommend this bow for any youth interested in bow hunting. Despite all the perks there are a few things I don't like. Though the package/carry case is a great way to carry your bow, you're unable to put the bow on it if you've installed the arrow holder and must remove it before putting the bow back on (I just don't use the arrow holder at all due to this). Worst of all the arrow rest strips the arrows' fletching and broke on my second shooting trip after the 14th shot just because I shot an arrow. Now That's just stupid.

"It does what it says - it provides a stable mount for up to two 2.5"" drives in a regular internal hard drive slot. Here are the problems:

It's not compatible with the newer ""toolless"" cases that use posts rather than screws to secure the hard drive. The posts will not fit through the holes. Luckily, thermaltake does provide all the screws you need - just pop the posts out of your hard drive tray or mounting bracket and replace with the larger of the two sizes of screw they provide.

It is also difficult to access the screw hols for the lower of the two drives in this mount. If you need to mount two drives, do the lower one first, and find a small screwdriver.

Finally, the connectors for the hard drive will be recessed about one inch into the bay compared to the rest of the drives. If you have a small or a very populated drive bay, it will be difficult to access those connectors, and if you have the angled SATA connectors, you will not be able to connect two drives in this bay, at least one drive will need a straight SATA connector.

"I gave this as a gift, but we all enjoy it.  The frame has handy features and is easy to use.  One thing I didn't realize before purchasing was EXACTLY how one got the photos on the frame.  I saw the option to insert a memory card so I assumed there would  be a USB cable for transfer.  This isn't the case.  You need to put the photos on the memory card.  I didn't have a card reader, so I went to Wal-Mart and bought a 'holder' for my 4GB card for [..].  That essentially turned it into a 4GB USB memory stick.  Now I just plug that into my computer, add photos, and return it to the frame.  I enjoyed the included Kodak software.  It made it fast and easy to edit my pics, but it caused some incompatibility issues and I had to delete it.  If it will work for you, it is well worth installing.  I use my regular graphics program now.  The frame screen size of 5X7 sounds smallish, but actually is just fine.  We have it on a stand that is only about 4 ft. from the one chair and maybe 10 ft. from the other that we use regularly and the frame can be viewed fine.  We can also see pics easily as we walk past this area repeatedly.  I love that we can see our pics all the time now (or from 1p to 9P with the built in timer).  Before I would have to sit at the computer and look at them, which is nice too, but I seldom did it.

"Pros: Picture quality is still good, Canon has not lost it's touch after ten years of making Elphs.  The size is awesome, I can place it anywhere I'd like.  With a three inch LCD, who needs a view finder - does anyone still use a view finder?  It offers a lot of scene modes and they are not that difficult to get to, it just takes a little time to get used to the buttons.  The 6.0 megapixel and 3x optical zoom and UA lens is all you need.  This Elph now offers a new ISO 800, which reduces image blur and expands low-light shooting ability.  It's camera solution CD-ROM software has improved a lot, so it's easier to download, edit, and view your pictures.

Cons: It's features are a bit basic but it offers just enough for those point and shot customers.  So if you want a lot of manual features you might want to pay more for another camera.  The LCD might get thumbprints very easily but I have one word for you: invisibleSHIELD.  Amazons might sell one for this camera, if not, do a web search.  It doesn't come with a case or bag; the manual is boring and just like all the others - you may need to buy a book if photography is a hobby for you.  The Function/Set buttons might be too small, but I have small hands so I'm cool with their size.

Conclusion: The Canon PowerShot SD630 is an solid ultracompact camera, with performance and photo quality that more than make up for its few design flaws and it's price. It's a good shooter, and its feature set makes it quite flexible for a camera of its size. That said, it's basically a more expensive version of the PowerShot SD600 with a larger screen and no optical viewfinder.",5.0,0

Would highly recommend this to someone who is wanting to expand their photo shooting hobby, but not willing to make the jump to SLR yet. For all of you SLR users, this camera will provide an outstanding back-up to your current set-up.

"After reading every review on deep fryers I could find, I finally decided on this one.  It has been great and I couldn't ask for anything better or more easy to use.

I put it on my cooktop and let my big hood suck away any odors.  It heats up quickly and the food has always come out great.  We made donuts after cooking shrimp and halibut with no cross-odors or tastes!  My family only tolerates fish, so this was greatly appreciated.

Cleanup is easy also.  After waiting for the oil to cool, the pan, lid and rack can go into the dishwasher.  Only the heating element has to be cleaned by hand and it is quite easy.  The oil can be used many times without problems and so it is more economical to use than I originally thought it would be.

I would recommend this with no caveats.",5.0,0

For some reason, I'd like to replace speakers once every 3 years or so to sample their sounds, as some do it with cars.  It's hard to describe the sound quality as opposed to be heard to experience.  But to wrap it up, these Takes are the best speakers of all the bookshelf systems I've had.

"My mom and dad had a Big Ben just like this on their nightstand back in the 1960s. I remember my dad regularly winding the clock and for that reason always associated this model with him. Thus I was thrilled that I could buy a replica of an object that I associate with happy times. The clock itself has been running well for more than eight years. Changing the battery is a bit cumbersome as you have to unscrew the back two screws, but not a big deal. Just pop in one AA battery and you'll be set for a long time.

I took off one star for two reasons. This clock is, of course, a replica, and it's not nearly as heavy as my mom and dad's original clock. But it looks just like it regardless. Second, I think the ticking is a bit loud. I keep the clock in the living room because I like a quieter tick at night by the bed. Other than that, I have been well pleased with this clock.",4.0,0
"When I received this several days ago, the materials seemed good enough. However, the handle has a slight clang. The plastic part is also very stiff and not conducive to grip. The handle is a little smaller than I like, but it's not very difficult to grip. The texture of the handle is very soft and smooth. The grip is very smooth. I've had no problems with any of the grips I've used. The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because of the small size of the handle, but I would have preferred a 5-star product.

Overall, it's a good product that does what it's supposed to do. It's not a bad product, but it does a bad job of keeping you safe. It's not a bad product at all, and it's not as good as the ones I've used. I'd still recommend this product to anyone who enjoys a good grip.

"I purchased this lightweight wonder from Big Lots for a great price. My 503 sq ft apartment, which has hardly any closet space, is too small for a heavy duty large vacuum. This vacuum is very easy to put together with only 2 pieces that go on to make it a complete upright vacuum. (No tools needed!)

OK but my SHARK NAVIGATOR LIGHT IS BETTER!
1. I cut my hair weekly with clippers and hair is either on the countertop or tile floors. The handheld got my countertops hair free and my tile floors were quickly cleaned.
2. The pet hair (white/brown shih tzu's long hair) was picked up in 1 swipe on kitchen tile floor, which usually takes me forever with my broom to get up.
3. The crevice attachment is amazing to clean windowsills, crown molding ledges, ceiling fan blades, and those spider webs in those hard to reach corners. Yes, my Spring cleaning began as soon as I purchased this cheap but helpful vac!
4. Cleans carpets as an upright but you will have to go over spots several times to get it squeaky clean and the suction is good enough to leave carpet lines.) By the way, my carpet areas are only 11x11 and 13x13 which the 16ft cord is just right! (For larger jobs I first use my manual Bissell Sweep-up and after picking up the larger pieces I use my featherweight vacuum. This keeps my featherweight from becoming clogged and preserving it.)
5. Quiet enough not to wake the entire neighborhood!

Needs some work:
1. The dust cup is small, which means you must empty after each use, and sometimes dust flies all over the front of the cup. Wet paper towel to the rescue!
2. Made of cheap plastic but what do I expect for $20!
3. No storage cup for the crevice attachment, but Velcro does wonders!

The only downside I have is that I don't like the color of the lenses. I have had no problems with them being scratched, but I would have liked a better color.

Overall, this product was very well received and was a great addition to my bike.My husband loves this shirt. He loves that it is made of a thin material and that it has a large chest pocket.  He does wear this shirt on the weekends and he does not mind being able to wear it all the time.  It is comfortable and fits him very well.I have a little old guy and it's a little big for him.  He just wears it and is very happy with it.  We were able to use it for our fishing trip and we had a great time.  The shirt is very comfortable and it is very easy to adjust to fit.  The material is very soft and the cotton fits snug.  The material is very breathable so you can",4.0,1

"The pictures clearly show brown furniture and it is advertised as tri-tone brown, but it is not brown. I have numerous different shades of brown furniture in my living room, hardwood floors, and brown wall decor, and none of them make the couch look like the picture. Without a doubt, the furniture is purple. It clashes with everything in our house. The visitors we had over last week called it ""merlot,"" which I believe is a very accurate description. The legs are black and look very cheap (I plan on replacing them).

However, if you think you would like a merlot-colored furniture set, this is a good one for the price. I really like the styling and the leather is quite soft. Even though it is genuine leather, the color is a treatment applied only to the top layer (the color does not saturate the leather), so if you scratch it - or if your cats scratch it - it will be noticeable. We have been staining the scratches as they occur and I think it is an acceptable solution.

Bottom line: the styling is great and it is a very nice looking set, except that the color is not as advertised. We would be 99% happy with the purchase if it would have arrived in any shade of brown whatsoever. If you can get past the color, I think you'll have a hard time matching the quality of this 3 piece set for the price.",3.0,0

"I'm really enjoying this lens. It's been an excellent choice, and has given me a lot more options than just my Nikon 50mm 1.4 D prime. I use it as my all-time walk around lens now.

Pros:

Construction quality is great. No dust in the lens, built big and tough. I took it camping with me and it held up great.
VC is fantastic. Not too loud for me. I like that I can hear it put itself into action.
Photos are sharp and clean.
Low light photos are no problem.
The lens lock button works well so the lens doesn't creep, but don't really need it. The zoom ring is tight enough to hold it.
Lens is easy to operate in manual focus mode too.
Price price price! Much less expensive when compared to the Nikon counterpart that doesn't have VC.

Cons:

Focus is not prime-lens-fast, but definitely quick enough to get the fast shot off  (just comparing to my prime 50mm 1.4).
Doesn't focus well on far away mountains / clouds. Sometimes the focus has a hard time locking on to things my prime has no problems with.
The lens is big, does add size and weight to my Nikon D300, but it balances well on the body.

My photos with the lens are here: [...]. I label the photos with tags on the right, so you know which lens was used.

"Interesting concept. I've seen a couple of mentions of the bumps and their purpose. I'm told they're to stimulate circulation. I don't know. They're not terribly comfortable and I would not want to sit on this thing with thin pants, or in pajamas or boxers, I do know that. If it were summer I would try throwing a towel across it to cushion the bumps and to keep my bare skin off the plastic.

It does work to keep your posture correct. I use it at my desk and I find it much more difficult to slouch. My biggest problem is that it is so narrow. I am about 6'4"" and 225 pounds. I'm not fat by any means. But my backside is too wide for this thing. My 11-year-old son could perhaps fit on it comfortably, but if you're an adult you might be in trouble.

I think it's a good idea, but just too small to be really effective (or comfortable). It's good that it comes with an inflating needle because I no longer have those around the house, my days of football and basketball being well behind me. It would be nice if it came with a pump but those are easy to obtain so I won't quibble over that.

I'd recommend it, despite the comfort issues, simply because it is better than the alternative. There are a lot of things we could and should do as we sit all day at our computers and ergonomics are critical. Get your monitor at eye level, your keyboard to where your arms and hands don't strain, and sit up straight! This, at least, will help with the latter until something better comes along.",4.0,0

"I loved this cooker, but it inexplicably went dead in the middle of a cycle after just two years of light use.  Given the cost of the item, I am not pleased.  Worse, this failure occurred abruptly after a spendy repair to the steam valve.

Before the failure, I found the device to make reliable rice and risotto. Having perfectly cooked rice in six minutes is definitely a luxury. The browning function made the slow cook feature very convenient- we made several pot roasts and a lot of pulled pork in this.  It was also nice to be able to use the pressure setting as a sort of turbocharge for the slow cooker if things were dragging.

That said, the short shelf life is not the cooker's only failing.  The gasket is fiddly and doesn't always seal properly.  Dirt tends to collect in crevices and it can be difficult to clean.

"Let me start off with the packaging.
1. It doesn't say ""Plus"" anywhere on it.
2. The information on the back isn't always correct. It says it has a mini-usb for example when it really has a micro-usb.
3. The packaging looks like something you'd get in a airport vending machine. Not very high end at all.

What is more important is the product itself.
1. It's much lighter than expected. It's a good thing for headphones, but it does make it feel unsubstantial. The diameter is about the size of a silver dollar.
2. The shiny black plastic looks like it will damage easy.
3. The logo in the middle looks like it should be a button. It isn't.
4. The front buttons are easy to access, but the volume buttons on the side are harder to feel.
5. The blue light flashes when it's powered on.
6. It stores in a very small spiral that can be like a puzzle to unravel until you get used to it.
7. Overall it is very comfortable and easy to forget you are wearing. Doesn't fall off easily.
8. USB port is covered by a little rubber flap that isn't very reassuring.

Most important is performance.
1. Bass is underwhelming. Sound is on the tiny side.
2. Connection strength is very good. Easy to walk around the house and not lose connection.
3, You can still easily hear the world around you at normal volumes.
4. Battery lasts as long as advertised and charges quickly.
5. You can still hear the trademark ""bluetooth buzz"" when the sound is low.
6. Microphone isn't very good at hearing you. Constantly had to talk louder than I would have with a phone.

Overall I feel like it is a solid product for the price. Will it win awards in... anything? Probably not, but it is still a great value. I feel it would be a five-star product at $30-35, but at $50 it's still a solid option for small, over-ear bluetooth headphones.

"First off did not buy here, but BestBuy instead.

These speaker  looks very promising on paper - brand name, good looking speaker, THX certification (better than no certification?).
Unboxing - Boxes are heavily taped up.  Lots of Styrofoam separates separately from satellites.  One thing I noticed was lots of wires,  the right speaker is the control unit, so you have red/black lead, a control wire that connects to speaker, and phono plug that goes to computer.  The left speaker only has red/black lead.  The subwoofer connections are spring loaded.  Some stick on padded circle feet are included.

Setup - With all the wires going around, you will need to remove the plastic wrapping and undo the twist ties.  Be careful with the connections especially the red/black not to reverse them and don't force the control cable into the sub, as it can go in only one way.

Sound - Klipsch is known for room filling sound.  Not terrible, not great.  However, listening at low- normal volumes I had some weird static/cracking sound on the left speaker.  I said ok, a fluke, so exchanged it for another in store.  The second unit was better on the left channel, but it had popping/cracking (like popcorn) sounds when the subwoofer was activated.  I can't pinpoint what the cause was in both situations - is it amp, crossover, something loose in the speakers, who knows.  My PC does not have a problem with other speakers so I know the problem is with Klipsch

I spent more time unpacking, setup, and packing, rather than listening to speakers.

I hope you others don't have the same problem.  After returning the second unit, I went on the floor to see what they had out, and guess what the Promedia 2.1 they had on the floor had some static noises on left speaker too!

"So I've had my Wagner Steamer for 2 days and I am wondering how I ever lived without it. It is amazing. I have parrots and it has made cleaning their cages a snap with no harsh chemicals. I also have about 1,200 sq. ft. of tile on my first floor (cream grout--what was I thinking). It have cleaned the grout to almost new. It also took out a stain in my carpet that the carpet cleaners were even unable to remove....woo hoo...now I have this lovely clean spot in my carpet in the middle of the hallway..LOL. It has cleaned everything I've put it to (candle wax out of cloth, grease out of stove vents, gum out of particle board). The only thing it didn't remove completely was red paint from my son's jeans--well I had to try. I can't wait to try it on removing wallpaper.

Regarding the cons I have read:
Noise Level: if noise bothers you invest in some good ear plugs. It didn't bother me at all though and I've been a steaming maniac for oh almost 24 hours total.
Doesn't work like promised: Well if you expect perfection you will always be disappointed I am afraid. I have not been disappointed one bit in mine.

Recommendations:
Buy yourself a good pair of knee pads--you will need them.
Buy extra nozzles. If you are going to use yours as much as I am using mine you will need the extra nylon nozzles. I've already worn one of the nozzles down half way...yes I've been using my machine A LOT!!

Pros:
What can I say...you would be nuts not to get one. That is if it is something that you think you will use on a weekly basis. If not buy one for a good friend that you know will use it all the time as a Christmas or birthday present and borrow it...LOL.",5.0,0

"I bought this for my mom, who has arthritis in her fingers and was having a lot of difficulty opening her wine bottles.  My parents have only been using it for 2 weeks now, but so far it's working very well.

There is a red LED at the top that indicates when it is charging.  Both of my parents expected this light to turn green or turn off when it was done charging, and for the first day were both concerned that the fact that it stayed red meant that it was not charging properly (and therefore would not work).  The light never turns off though, and it never changes color.. all it does is indicate when it is getting power.  I'm not sure how descriptive the manual is about this.

Also, it took a few times for my mom to realize that she doesn't have to push down on it while opening the wine bottle.  No need to press down at all.  It does require you to hold the bottle still, or else it spins the entire bottle, but you don't have to press down at all.  You just press the button and it does all the work for you.

I don't know if it will continue to work as it does right now, but if it doesn't then I'll modify my review.  So far, it's working exactly as I had hoped.

UPDATE: November 2013:
My parents still continue to use this electric wine bottle opener.  Occasionally they have some trouble getting the cork to come off the corkscrew, and since the corkscrew is sharp (as it is supposed to be), they have to be careful getting it off (my dad cut his finger on it once, but has been more careful since then).

"Leaf 0 bag. This bag compresses well and easily fits into my hiking pack's sleeping bag compartment with room to spare for my clothes for a weekend backpacking trip. I camped with a lean-to tarp configuration instead of a tent. The temperature dropped to about 35 overnight. I got sweaty in the bag because I sealed myself in it completely (head and face) which caused moisture to build up in and around the bag and allowed me to get cold. However, I'm confident it would keep me warm in the same conditions if I kept my nose and mouth outside of the bag when sleeping.

Overall, this bag looks great, feels comfortable, packs away small, doesn't weigh much, and is warm.

I would recommend to a friend as a backpacking bag.",5.0,0

"For reference, I am a regular at the gym, but I go for maintenance, not to pump up strength or to maximize muscle growth.  In the past, I purchased most of my gym gloves at a discount retailer like TJ Maxx.  I was looking for something as cheap as possible, that I did not expect to last over a year.  When I received an offer to try these at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review, I expected them to be like all the other gloves I bought in the past.

Instead, I was blown away by the quality of these gloves!  The majority of the glove is made from a very soft leather, that looks like it will last for a long time.  the non contact part of the gloves is a really high quality mesh material that keeps the gloves breathable.  The gloves are half finger, which I like, as feeling the weights keeps me in control of them.

Based on other reviews, I did go a size up, and they fit me very well.  They are also very versatile, as I can use them for biking as well as in the gym.  I find them to be very comfortable, and I tend to forget I even have them on!

Overall, even at full price, I think this are a bargain on a high end, versatile gym gloves!",5.0,0

"This is the best pan I've ever used.  I also own a Wolf Gourmet pan, which is good, but this Viking pan is even better!  It conducts heat so well that I cooked chicken breasts last night on my gas burner stove on the low to low-medium heat setting.  A 1.5 tablespoon pad of butter melted so quickly yet didn't burn, which made cooking so unbelievably easy.  I also love how deep the pan is, reducing (eliminating) grease splatter.  The three chicken breasts were very large but had plenty of room in this pan to cook completely evenly despite the fact that the flames underneath did not extend more than a couple inches out from the center of the pan.  Even my children noticed a difference in the quality of the meat saying how juicy and tasty the chicken was compared to how it's usually cooked, especially when the breasts are so thick.

Note, the instructions that come with the pan tell you to condition the pan with oil before first use and then every few months after.  I did condition the pan per the instructions and I'm glad I followed that tip ahead of time.",5.0,0

"Great bike, cost a little more than you'll find in department stores, but it's a lot more bike.  This bike has no foot brakes, so the rider will have to learn to use the hand brake.  I purchased tektro calipers and front brake handles to install so the bike will have a front brake also, but it's not necessary because once adjusted the single rear brake works fine and is plenty strong.  A note about the brake handle and little hands.. Squeeze the handle and use a n allen wrench to screw the little bolt sticking out the side of the handle, in.  This makes the reach to grab the handle less.  You may have to give relieve some tension on the brake cable after doing this by using the screw adjusters at the handle or at the back of the bike.  The bike goes together quickly and easily.  Now if you want to adjust it properly as far as the bearings, bottom bracket, headset, brake, etc, then I suggest googling Park Tools and using their tutorials, or if you have a friend into cycling have them look at it, or it having a bike shop adjust it for you.  You can simply assemble it and ride it, but getting everything adjusted properly will make it last longer and ride easier.

"This drive failed on me at a critical moment in the field. I had only owned it for 6 months, and it was not used very intensively. It spent its short life in my laptop satchel and was never dropped or otherwise damaged.

During a photo shoot, I tried to copy data from my full laptop hard drive to the Passport. The drive simply would not work. It was powered on and spinning but the computer could not see it or use it. After trying to get it working, it began making clicking noises and I determined it to be dead.

"I'd checked other options since last summer, and have acquired enough 2 liter seltzer bottles to start a bottle tower garden.
Did not want to buy into a proprietary soda-making system, but that seemed the only option till I chanced on a review of the Mastrad Purefizz.
From the design and operation of the Purefizz to the fact that the chargers are recyclable, this is a winner.
It arrived today, right on schedule. On my first attempt, I made two yummy egg creams using the chocolate syrup recipe Rachel Meeks provides on her small notebook dot org site. She credits Amy D of The Complete Tightwad Gazette for the recipe.

Though I ordered from Mastrad, I thank Amazon and the previous product reviewers who convinced me to get this gem.

Updated 041715: Can I add a star? I made seltzer water a few weeks ago and forgot about it in the fridge. Opened the Mastrad last night and poured a lovely glass of fizzy water. One more this morning. Surely didn't expect the bubbles to last so long - and I'm not counting on this happening again.
After seeing reviews about rust at the bottom and metallic taste: I've had this nearly a year and keep it, full or empty, in the fridge. It's great.
Keeping the Purefizz and the water very cold prior to use and in between uses has worked well. I use the pressurized top when returning the Purefizz to the fridge, where it stays unless it's making a new batch of seltzer. And it never goes in the dishwasher.",5.0,0

"I purchased 3 of them with great expectations.  Using supplied sortware, I got only one camera on my computer, and could not get the other 2 on with it. At set up, I tried using: first Wireless and later with cable 5e.  Just could not get them to work all together. I gave up and they are sitting unplugged in the corner for over 2 months.

Anyway, when you can get all 3 on supplied software on my PC, instructions want you to go into the Router security system's guts and change access for external viewing. We depend on the router for our living, working from home when away from office, and we dare not tamper with the internal setting of our router and risk loss of work and income.  A big mysterious disappointment.

I may buy another router, taking our main router off line , and trying to get the cameras to work with a 2nd router.  If I mess up internet connection  with that 2nd router (while trying open access on the 2nd router for internet viewing) I can always take the 2nd router off-line and plug back in our old, great working, reliable router. I may try that next month.

Strong, but not heavy. It cut everything with no problem. I love knives and am newer knife collector. I had worries since it was not a full length knife, and the hardened plastic handle felt so light I was worried it would break if used a lot. But it held up great. The handle with the finger placement divots are awesome! This thing fits in your hand like a glove and I like the spot for your thumb on the top. After using it many times I didn't really need to sharpen it at all the entire deployment and for a while after I got back. The only problem I have with it, and with SOG is that for being such a pro-military, American company, nearly all of their products are NOT made in the U.S. This is a problem for me. Don't act like it is some all American company and knife, yet get your stuff made in Asia. That is why it would not get 5 stars.

"OK...I have been carrying every known backpack since 1976 when I joined the Army, Rangers and Special Forces.  I was skeptical of buying a Badlands backpack...I've never had a backpack this small (compared to a SOF CFP-90, Dana, Mystery Ranch)  But this backpack is perfect for a bow hunter.  I have not purchased the Bow Boot...I will...but this is just big enough to carry everything I need to stalk into my tree, put up my stand and then pull out all my ""warmies"" and get comfortable for the days hunt.  The straps give you options to tie things on the backpack...even without the Bow Boot...I can safely secure my bow to the backpack.  I can even use the side straps...that have a weird configuration...but are perfect to strap the backpack to my Lone Wolf Alpha Tec or Lone Wolf Sit and Climb platform with shoulder straps on the frame and hike them both in.  I normally leave the stand and hunt it three days and then just backpack the pack in and out.  The pockets are innovative.  It took me a while to lay out all of my equipment and find a proper spot for them but I have been able to put in...Rattle and Roll Rattle, Deer Grunt Call, Binoculars, extra knife, knife sharpener, cleaning gloves, Laser Range Finder, Bottle to Drink, Bottle to get rid of Drink, Deer Camera, Tree Saw, Rain Jacket, Rain Paints, Vest, Sweater, Extra Cold Weather Gloves, Baseball hat, Tree Screw, 3D roll of fabric.

The other issue I have with this bike is that it's not a very big thing.  I have a 5 footer and it's only about 10 inches wide.  I had to buy two larger bikes, but I don't think I can find a large bike with a 5 footer.  I have a 5 footer with a lot of space in it, and it was too big for me.  I will probably get a shorter bike for the money.  I'll just go with the larger bikes.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a compact bike that won't require much to do.

"In cycling, White is the new Black right now. White bikes, white saddles, white stems, and even white handlebars covered in (and completely obscured by) white tape. My new mountain bike - designed to spend most of its life in the dirt - is painted white. Obviously there are problems with this trend. Within 6 months of getting my road bike, the white tape it came with was starting to yellow and deteriorate. I had seen a positive review online of the DSP bar tape and a local shop also recommended it as well, so I decided to give it a try.

I have only been using the tape for two months, but at this point I couldn't be happier with the product. In fact, I just ordered more to put on my cyclocross bike. The extra thickness of the DSP tape helps make rough roads more pleasant. Also, the synthetic material remains easy to grip even with damp or sweaty gloves. I can't tell much about durability at this point, but I suspect the extra thickness will lead to a longer life for this bar tape as well.

Also, for those of you that are into the trend of everything white, I am told by the bike shop that the synthetic material in the DSP tape stays white longer than most of the other stuff on the market.",5.0,0

"I bought two of these rash guards to take on a trip to Playa Del Carmen, Mexico. I bought one in XL and the other in XXL. The XL fit perfectly, but not like a baggy XL t-shirt would. It fits me more like a Large t-shirt would. But that's they way it's supposed to be. I'm a little out of shape these days so I wanted to get the next size up so I'd have two for two different activities. The XL I used for snorkeling and scuba diving because I didn't want the shirt to be to loose while doing those activities. The XXL, which fit more like an XL t-shirt, I used for hanging around the pool and going to the beach in.

I used both shirts every day that I was in Mexico and they were awesome. They fit well, dried fast, and kept me from getting burned. My skin was just as white returning home as when I left for Mexico, so they did their job. =) Of course, that wasn't the only reason I bought them. I'm not in the shape I used to be, so I spared the people at the resort from seeing my big white belly. =P

The only downside is that it's very small. The mount is designed to be a little too large for a regular tripod. It's not a huge deal, but it is very heavy for such a small mount.

The only downside I can think of is that the auto-focus ring has a tendency to lose focus. I tried to reset it by putting it on the tripod, and it will not do that. I don't know why. I've tried other options, but I just couldn't get it to work.

These little big salt and pepper shakers are really cute, and well made. They easily stand on their own and make such a cute little set!
The noses come off to allow the inside to be filled, and the opening was large enough that filling them was very easy.
The silicone noses are brightly colored and although they are easy to remove when you want to, they DONT slide off any other time. To remove, you simply slide a fingernail under the side and peel it up.
I was a little hesitant about the size of the holes. I feel like they could be made just a tiny bit bigger, BUT I personally have 2 kids and DO appreciate that they can use these without worrying about them dumping too much seasoning on their food. If I decide to widen the holes then I know it will be easy because of the silicone.
I have put these through the dishwasher with no issue, although I do not plan (or really foresee a need) to do it again.

All in all, these little piggy shakers are a really adorable little set, and very well made. They made a great addition to my kitchen and I would recommend them to anyone who is looking to replace any other boring salt and pepper shakers!

"The Ontario Gen II SP-50 is a splendid knife with a blade of 5160 carbon steel. It cuts, slashes, dices and slices, all with astounding results, but like most blades in its class, it's heavy. And it's not stainless steel, meaning it will rust. Is it worth the money? Easily, and then some. Is it better than the RTAK II? Well, maybe. I haven't been able to decide. The SP-50 has better blade steel (the RTAK II having 1095 carbon), but the RTAK II has better grips and a way better sheath. And, to me, performance is about the same. The blade finish is better with the SP-50.

"I've heard these speakers at my local computer store. These are the best sounding among all the brands offered. Klipsch didn't sound as good and Creative Labs' isn't even an option. The control center is the best design so far. The display and power button emit a cool blue light that is nice to see at night. Every component looks very sturdy. There are three possible connections - Coax, Optical, mini. You can use all for three different sources. Just press a button from the control center to indicate what source you would like to use. How good are these speakers?  I own a couple. It may not compare to my JBL HT system which are THX-certified for true home theater use, but these cost thousands. With the price you're paying for the Logitech, it's a steal. I have Harman/Kardon Sound Sticks for my Mac and these suck especially for the price. I had Sony Dream System  DAV-C990 which I returned after two weeks because the speakers are not only dull, they seriously need some equalization. Now for the cons:
1. The speaker cords are too thin and short. 2. The cord from the control center to the bass module is way too short and the manual warns against extending it. I want my bass in the corner of the room, and the control beside my PC. 3. The remote needs aesthetic improvement. These speakers have good, powerful bass right out of the box. Bass lovers will adore these for their games and music. Just reduce the bass from the control center if it annoys you. Best of all - these are THX-certified. You can't beat the price and quality. Even Apple has adapted these speakers for their upcoming G5 desktops. And if someone knows good design, these people do.",4.0,0

"I picked this machine up at a garage sale for 10 bucks. It was used once and still in its original box with everything it came with. I figured it was worth a try. I roasted a 5.4-lb chicken and took note of the useful tips I saw throughout the reviews here. Spray the back plate and prongs with cooking spray, line the drip tray with foil, tie the legs and wings to hold together tightly, put it on the rack with the legs facing away from the motor. In 80 minutes it was done without any problems. It was the juiciest chicken we've ever had, very tasty indeed. You cannot get this from your oven, no way. The complaint of some about the heat this puts out wasn't a problem. I have a ceramic cooktop and it was just fine on it. I can't wait to try turkey breast or a very small turkey.
I took one star away for the following: the rotators sometimes have a skip or delay because one wheel sits on the other without any additional latch to keep them together. For chicken roasting this is less of a problem, but I can see lighter foods or unbalanced loads have an issue. There is no on or off button, instead you have to unplug to turn it off and there is no pause button to stop the rotisserie to check for doneness, you have to unplug to stop it. Was it worth $10?

"I had never made lollipops but always wanted to. I have gotten into trying to make many new recipes and foods in the last few years and thought this would be fun so I placed my order for the mold.

The set comes with one mold and one set of sticks. If you want to make them again you would have to purchase more sticks. Our local hobby store sells them and you can order them online. The mold itself can be used in the freezer, microwave, and oven. It is also dishwasher safe;; however I could not test that as I do not own a dishwasher.

The mold does not come with any type of recipe for creating lollipops. If you look online however you can find many recipes for free. The mold only has a spot for a dozen to be made at once. For a family the size of mine, I would need to make several batches. It would be easier to have a larger set of molds or to purchase multiple sets.

The molds do not require spray as the pan is silicone and nonstick. They are easy to clean and since they are silicone and small and easy to store. I am looking forward to trying many new recipes with this mold.

"This is a robust, well-made chain cleaning device of debatable utility.

Here's how it works. You fill it with soapy water or degreaser. Then you attach it to your chain and attempt to backpedal. The gears complain and water sloshes out from both sides because it has much more friction than you expected. You eventually find a hand position that keeps it stable and doesn't repeatedly derail the chain, then doggedly run it through.

The result is a clean-looking chain. The outside part. The inside part that actually matters is mostly untouched. This, after probably two minutes of running the chain in both directions.

Here's what actually worked: a bunch of cheap microfiber cloth towels (they don't disintegrate like cheap cotton towels), WD-40 bike degreaser, and Finish Line's ""Gear Floss."" Put WD-40 (or practically any other degreaser) on the microfiber, hold the chain through it, and run it through until it's clean on the outside. Then, for each big link, double up a piece of gear floss and pull it through. Do the small links too if you want. Total time is about three minutes. It's cleaner, faster, cheaper, and more thorough than this thing.

If you really want the chain to sparkle, spend a moment to undo the quick-link (probably) holding it together. Then put it in a soda bottle with ten or twelve ounces of citrus degreaser and shake for a minute or two. Short of an ultrasonic cleaning or soaking the chain in petroleum solvents and scrubbing it with a brush, that's as clean as it's going to get.",2.0,0

"I was looking for a sturdy waterproof camera for my daughter. I wanted a good quality camera that could stand up to the mishaps of an eleven year old. She is in love with this camera because of all of the neat features that it has. She is able to take selfies with the frontal view of the camera allowing her to see herself. It is shock proof and so far it stands up to that fact as she has dropped it several times, knowing at times she can be clumsy this camera has given me the tranquility to know that this camera will outstand some of the abuse.

The down side that I have found with this camera is that it uses batteries and no charger. We fixed the problem by buying recharger batteries, which is great because she uses the camera quite a lot. Using a 2gb seems to go pretty fast, so I definitely recommending to get a bigger mini memory card. This will help from needing to remove or transfer pictures to another device. The batteries seems to hold for the usage, so don't be scared that it won't last long. Definitely recommend the product!",5.0,0

"From some distance away, this 6-foot garland looks fairly realistic, but you get too close, and you can see the vinyl/plastic look to it. The color is definitely realistic. Some of these garlands you buy are a fake-looking bright green, but this is comparable to a real pine color. There are circle hooks at each end of the garland for easy attaching to your banister or fireplace mantle. I will be using it on our upstairs balcony, since it looks better from a distance. Wish it was a little longer - maybe 8 to 10 ft. The product did come rolled nicely in the plastic packaging, so it wasn't twisted or tangled. I'd recommend packing it the same way when storing your Christmas decorations.

Got this for Christmas last year. Had 2 6.5s and a bridged 12 hooked up. Ran 0 gauge from battery and ground and 12g to speakers. Worked well for about 6 months. Around July or August it started having issues channels failing in an odd way. Any amp Ive had in the past that has gone bad the channel stayed dead. It developed a whine in one speaker and then channels would randomly cut out until you turned it off for a few minutes and back on again. This would cut out in one channel one day and another on a different day. Rechecked wiring and all is good. Distortion is bad at higher volumes and bass is very muffled. For the price it sounded as expected and for the time it did work it worked ok. I did expect it to last longer than it did.,2.0,0

"Been using these for a little while now for squats. I lack the flexibility in my shoulders to get my hands close together on the bar without putting weight on my wrists. While I work on the flexibility issue, I used these. They offer great support for my wrists even at higher weights, and I can get through my sets without pain. There were a few times prior to this that the pain was so great I simply couldn't complete my sets without taking a really wide grip (which negatively effects performance and safety).

"I guess I am an old mossback and remember having a basket for my bike but it sure is hard to find one these days for bikes with no fenders and all manner of handlebar styles. Just to be clear, I do use my bike for exercise but not in any way competitively. I use my bike to walk my large dogs on pavement, grass and dirt. It would take forever to wear them out walking and I am too old and arthritic to even consider jogging or running any more. Anyway I could carry gear in a back pack and I have but it is hassle to have to take it off and get stuff out, especially when there is nothing to set it on like a basket and the back pack was getting heavier and heavier and then I found this basket. I cannot imagine any bike this would not fit other than maybe an all out racing bike. Installation is a snap and should not take literally over a minute, you will need no tools and it comes off just as easily if needed. Some of the good features (1) the hooks that go over the handlebars are padded and provide all the support needed (2) the lower support goes on the stem with Velcro (3) the basket itself can be removed from the bracket and carried like a small grocery store basket (4) the bottom of the basket has a small mesh to prevent small items from slipping through. I cannot think of any negatives at all.

Found a big negative. The velcro strap will eventually break and the basket bracket becomes unstable and you can't buy a new strap or just the bracket! I admit to being hard on both the bike and the basket but this has been a real weak link in what is otherwise pretty bullet proof. The next On I think I will see if there is a way I can clamp or wire it on.",4.0,0

"I received this UPS a couple days ago and found it was fully charged when I received it.  This is my first Tripp Lite UPS.  I have been a loyal APC user for my entire computing life.  I figured I would see if TL is any better.  I was surprised that the battery was already hooked up and fully charged when the device arrived.  I let it run for two days.  First day had no load and second had a minimal load.  Tonight I installed the unit in my media center.  So far I have had no issues and no smell as reported by others.  I currently use this UPS in my media center to keep a TV, sound system, CATV box and DVD running.  Current full load is without the DVD and usage is at 37%.  With everything turned off, I still see a draw of 9%.

The only thing that is slightly annoying, and why I gave this item a 4-star review, is that I cannot figure out how to turn off the LCD display when I did not need it.  It is a nice night light in the living room, but I would rather have the display go out automatically or even manually.  I read documentation offline and online and found no clues.  I sent an email to tech support but haven't heard anything after 3 days.  Guess I will call their Chicago phone number and ask.  Unfortunately I only remember to call after they close.

Otherwise, the unit seems to be solid.  Minus the inability to figure out how to turn off the display, I am happy with my purchase.  Time will tell if I switch to Tripp Lite, try someone else or go back to APC.",4.0,0
"This mount doesnt have much good stuff going on.

1) only docks with metal clips. Doesnt work with nylon clips most commonly found on kydex holsters. Its simply not wide enough so don't think yours will fit even closely.
2) I had to use a Dremel and razor to trim it down so it would fit a metal holster clip. And even when I did this, there is very very little clip retention. So when I go to drap the forearm from the holster I have mounted in my car, the holster detaches and comes up with the forearm.

I don't see how there isn't a holster mount available that is compatable with typical nylon clips. This one would be a good design, if it were remotely compatable. I simply don't get reassurance with this mount because the holster rarely stays in place when I go to draw. Its not a safe and reliable choice.",1.0,0

"This has been working very well for us. We got a new house recently that had some musty smells in the closet built off the master bedroom's attached bathroom. The prior owners had obviously not done a good job ventilating or keeping moisture controlled. I put one of these in there, and have been keeping the door closed except when going in or out. After a week, the air has changed dramatically, and you can even feel the dryness of the air when you open the door. I would heed the warnings here, and put a pan under the bucket though, jut in case the plastic does break, but I think that is more likely if it is exposed to direct sunlight in a high heat situation, like in a car sitting out in the sun.

"Let me start by saying I bought this to replace my Technivorm, which no longer was doing the job correctly. The Bonavita is half the price, and does the same thing: hot coffee at the proper brewing temperature, and quickly, too. My initial impression of it out of the box is that it is solid and very well made. Compared to Technivorm I would say it is just as good quality.
There are some feature differences. First, the part where the coffee goes sits directly on top of the carafe on the Bonavita. I find this a little awkward because it's hard to remove the carafe once the coffee is brewed; a little more clearance on top would solve this. Secondly, the carafe doesn't have that nifty lid like the Technivorm has, which allows the coffee to mix in the carafe. In other words, you have to stir the coffee after brewing in the Bonavita. Thirdly, there is no adjustable flow on the Bonavita. This is not a bad thing, as I was always having problems with the Technivorm getting plugged up during brewing (I use a permanent filter.) This doesn't happen at all on the Bonavita because it has just a hole set slightly up on the side--instead of on the very bottom--- where the coffee drips out. The only drawback to this is there is always going to be 1/4 or 1/2 an inch of coffee in the bottom of the ""brew cup"", which has to be poured out into the carafe. However,you never have to worry about coffee dripping out the bottom all over your counter every time you lift it off the carafe.
Overall, this is a great replacement for the Technivorm, which is frankly overpriced. The Bonavita is much simpler to operate. I am very pleased with this purchase!",4.0,0

"Like many other reviewers, I can confidently rate this tablet with at least 4 stars...provided you're a geek who is comfortable rooting your devices and installing new ROMs. As nearly anyone who has used this tablet will tell you, out of the box it's complete crap. How Viewsonic managed to so badly mangle the operating system is beyond me. But...spend just a couple minutes on the xda forums to find the instructions for how to root, spend another couple of minutes performing the root and ROM installation (and, for extra credit, install the Pershoot kernel), and you'll have a tablet that is lightening quick and capable.

I am currently running the latest VEGAn ROM (Gingerbread flavored) with the Pershoot kernel overclocked to 1.4 GHz. With a couple of battery-draining apks (applications) deleted, I'm still seeing amazing battery life and applications launch immediately.

A couple of notes if you're one of those people who has been slobbering after the latest ""fruity"" tablet... This ain't no iPad. But that's only because the Android OS is still transforming from it's caterpillar form into the beautiful butterfly it will become. You'll trade ""pretty"" for ""powerful"" since a rooted tablet like this one will give you full access to all of the amazing (and often experimental) apps in the Android Market.

Another ding: accessories. I picked up the USB keyboard/case for this device on amazon (for about $25) and love it. It adds amazing functionality with complete plug-and-play ability. But...that's about the *only* case you'll find for it besides the generic sleeves for 10"" tablets (I also got one of those).

I would be remiss if I didn't mention that the dreaded poor viewing angle for the screen often annoys me. It's true that you could potentially claim this is a ""privacy"" feature, but don't be fooled. I've often had to tweak the angle to get a comfortable non-eye-strain producing view of the screen for long periods.

Lastly, the front-facing camera (the only one) stinks. But, at a price half to a third of similar tablets on the market, I'm OK with that and the other limitations I mentioned.",4.0,0

"It's difficult to open and close the side bags.  It really requires two hands, and when in saddle, that's annoying.  Hopefully we all have horses good enough that you CAN take your hands away from your reins, twist in your saddle, and fiddle with the zipper.  I do, but it's still annoying.

The cantle bag.  I put my oilskin duster (heavy trenchcoat type long jacket, for the men out there who don't know what it is) in the cantle bag, and I could not keep the whole rig right-side up...it kept slipping to one side.  I ended up having to do some serious anchoring to keep it mostly up.  Might be user error, but the next day I just tied my duster on the back of my cantle and left the bag in camp.

It's well-made.  I don't have a complaint about that.  And the pockets are nice & deep.  But I think I'll buy some cheaper ones that are easier to deal with in saddle.
Edit: about 2 years later.  I don't use the cantle bag.  I'm not a hardcore camper or anything like that.  The bags are used every few weekends on a ride (sometimes more).  Still inconvenient to get into in-saddle, but the bags are still in great shape, zippers in great shape. I bumped up from 3 to 4 stars.  I can't quite give it 5 because I can't attest to whether or not the cantle bag is any good.",4.0,0
"This thing is amazing.  I own this type and the one with the handle.  I use it while starting up the fire pit for my little girl to cook smores.

Every custom knife sheath maker that I have encountered can put a holder on your sheath, kydex or leather. It's very simple to use...cost as much as a cheap zippo and is more reliable!  The 3/8"" steel is perfect for me...it shows a little wear and I don't doubt that it will last 1,000's of strikes as it is advertised.  With good technique, which you can acquire by watching youtube, and a 5-10 minute practice to...well...practice and get the coating off, you can get good technique and start fires with only a few strikes (at most).

"Received shoe rack in a reasonable amount of time.  Assembly is easy enough (15-20 minutes).  Shoe rack is stable.

The finish of the metal tubing is nice aesthetically. The plastic connectors work well, but look a bit cheap and may also remind you of children's connecter toys.

My biggest issue with the rack itself is the shelving material.  It resembles black weed control paper you'd put under mulch, with a thin plastic layer on top.  Will it hold shoes and be pretty easy to clean, yes I think so.  Is it a durable material....No.  If you think this rack will receive any amount of abuse or rough handling, I might look elsewhere.

Now to the sellers service:
My rack was missing four tubes needed to complete assembly.  I contacted the seller and the following was our (abridged) discourse.

Seller:. Can you please take a picture of missing pieces and send (via email) so we can verify what is needed.

Me: Pictures sent

Seller: These components are out of stock.  Can you buy them elsewhere and we will reimburse you?

Me: That is unacceptable.  You are the manufacturer of these components. Open another box if need be, and please send me what is needed to complete the shoe rack you sold me.

Seller: components are out of stock, we are issuing you a refund.

Ultimately, I felt like they were trying to get me to drop my request by making things less straight forward than they should have been, but I don't know that for sure, and I do appreciate that in the end they rectified the situation.

Take this for what it's worth.  It's a utility shoe rack and the seller is responsive and NOT in the business of cheating customers.",3.0,0
"It's as simply as it gets, and an excellent choice in a portable lapdesk.

Appealing in every way.  The thin (about 0.5"") and light design (my postal scale weighs it in at 1lb 13oz) makes it a perfect companion to your notebook carrier or bag.  A highly confident no-skid surface has a rubberized feel, and your computer is very secure.  The cool slide out mouse pad/tray is firm and does not move with use.  The pad is exceptional for traction or laser.

I currently have two testable units.. a 15""+ PC and 8""+ netbook.  It's great for both, but the larger proves that this desk is the perfect fit as it is invisible once placed.  Usage appeal for me is, ironically, in bed.  I have bought several options for bed use in the past, but always found them to be cumbersome or difficult to move etc.  And god forbid you had to get up quickly.  With this desk, you simply move your computer instead of having to move one then the other.  Then there is car use.  No more lugging something to avoid burning your legs.  A simple take-along and it slides right under the seat.  I have not used it for travel or airplane, but I see this as a great option if needed.  My PC is getting ""older"" and I feel it gets hotter than it should at times, but this is a great remedy.  The hollow core keeps it cooler and safer.  When not in use, I store it easily on my bookshelf, and it takes no room.",5.0,0

"First - about sizing. The Amazon size choices for this item list many 'tall' sizes that the are not available on the NeoSport website.  The only 'tall' size offered by NeoSport is 'Large/Tall'.  So - even though I ordered an XLTall from Amazon I expected to get just an XL. That was OK with me since it is usually a sleeve length issue for me and since this item is a vest sleeve length did not matter. When the vest arrived it was tagged XLT (just like I ordered). I don't know why this item is available, from Amazon anyway, in sizes that the company does not advertise. I looked for other NeoSport items on Amazon that might come in 'tall' sizes but found none.
  About the vest...I am 6'4"" tall and have a 35"" waist and a 45"" chest and weigh 200#. The XLT fits me perfectly. A very snug fit but that is the way a wetsuit item should fit for best performance. It has a heavy duty zipper that is backed by a flap of fabric so you don't catch any chest hair on the way up and down. After paddling 4 hours this afternoon the zipper stayed in place without working its way down. The arm holes seem a little small but that adds to the effectiveness of the insulation qualities. I could feel the fabric at the arm holes while paddling but did not get any chafing. Next time out I will try wearing a lightweight wicking shirt under the vest just to see if it feels any different.
  This item is priced pretty closely with other items of its type, although some I have tried did not have the protective flap of fabric backing the zipper.

"This thing is awesome! I've used the soundfreaq soundkick for work for a couple of years and occasionally I bust it out at home but it's better suited for beating out ambient noise (for audibility's sake)  than it is for casual home listening. I wanted more, and I got it. The fluance  isn't really a good buy for portability, in my opinion. This is for a technology affluent sort who wants good sound they can tie to their smart phone. The unit is surprisingly heavy, which ends up being a good thing. Bass is substantial without being muddy, which I deeply appreciated after too much time spent with bose and Sony units at friends houses. It's sound has a difficult to place warmth that I imagine comes from the heavy wood enclosure. Highs are clear without being tinny, and mids are presented well. I personally believe that if mid range presentation is something you are deeply concerned with, single unit Bluetooth speakers will consistently disappoint you.  Get something more akin to a stereo. With all of that said, I strongly suspect you will enjoy the sound of this unit. I've thrown everything at this thing, and it consistently sounds amazing. I've played techno, heavy metal, jazz, bossa nova, acoustic players like Andy McKee, and more others than I care to mention and it adds listening value to all of them. I don't want to understate this. Koop, the dillinger escape plan, aphex twin, jars of clay and Eric clapton all sounded awesome. That's a tonal diversity I'm not accustomed to with anything other than my sennheiser headphones that cost considerably more.
I would shop around a little more if portability is a major selling point for you, but on all other points I urge you to get this unit. It is a delightful tonal surprise at this price and I'm thrilled with my purchase.",5.0,0

"Revised review.

The first season I had an issue with the latch closing after a few weeks of use. The latch closed too easily and I had to re-open the latch to get it open again. The second season I had a problem with the latch closing after several weeks of use. The latch closes a bit too easily, and it also opens a bit too easily with a strong force. I have had this problem with the first season and the second season. Both issues are very similar.

I have used this for the past year, and I am very satisfied with the results.

Pros:

- Easy to use
- Very easy to read

Cons:
- Difficult to read

I would recommend this product to anyone.

"My boys (ages 10 and 13) love the swimming pool.  We also have a large pool.  The pool is open to the outside and is easy to clean.  The pool is comfortable and well ventilated.  We have used it for swimming and swimming pool play.  It is a great place to have the pool and hang out.  It is a great pool for adults and children.  The pool is nice and spacious.  I like that the pool is easy to clean.  I do wish the pool had a little extra room for our small children to sit on and play.  They like that it is easy to clean and not have to clean up the pool.

I'm 5'11"" and 140lbs and the pool is a good size for me.  I don't have to worry about the pool getting dirty.  The pool is pretty small, but not too big.  I will probably get a little more room in the pool.  The pool is very good quality, but not very large.  I would definitely buy this again.

Tough and durable. Be sure to look yours over and make sure the enamel isn't chipped or doesn't completely cover everything. Im so happy I purchased this item. It's really heavy but cooks so well and is durable. I would recommend hand washing and only using wood utensils. It takes time to heat up and or cool down.

"First of all, for those who have the time and money, it's a great product!  It is so small that it's not portable and takes up a lot of space.  The only thing I wish it had was a little bit better construction.  I like the shape of the rubber band.  I love the fact that the caps are made of plastic instead of aluminum.  I just wish there was a little more space for the sound bar.  I would have preferred that it have a little more sound, but I would prefer the rubber band to be solid.

This is a good thermometer.  I wish it were faster but I honestly haven't found one that was fast.  The probe it came with frayed after about a year.  The replacement probe is thinner and coated so it makes smaller holes and is fray-resistant.  As with any thermometer calibrating is a must.  Mine was off 3 degrees on the high side.  Ice water should be 32F and boiling water 212F.  Hold the CAL button for 5 seconds then use the arrow buttons to say how many degrees you want to adjust it.,4.0,0

"I was one of the first to purchase Trakdots when they initially came out, then quickly learned (a) there is virtually no user support, and (b) the software was horribly flawed. Since then, the company has paid buyers to ship the units back for a ""major software update,"" but...getting my two units back has been a nightmare.

I shipped them to the vendor, as directed, in early November, yet here I am in late January, STILL trying to get my supposedly-updated TrakDots back. Endless emails back and forth, lots of ""We'll overnight them right away"" promises, but nothing.

If it was possible to give negative stars on a review, I would. TrakDots are a complete waste of money.

Finally got two units back. Notice I didn't say ""my units."" In spite of assurances we'd be getting our originals back, I was sent two open box returns that someone else dumped. The security seals on both boxes were torn open; the serial number on one unit had been completely removed (rendering it incapable of being activated) with the ""Warranty void if damaged"" seal torn in half.

One of my two originals had yet to be activated (read: brand new, unused). Now, I'm holding someone else's rejects.

After circling back to TrakDot *again,* was sent two more replacement units. These did not appear to have been opened, however...neither one would power on. Tried multiple batteries, to no avail. Both units were dead boxes.

This time, I cc'd (Harry Streck, President of GlobaTrac) on my email to Customer Service, asking for a full refund of my entire purchase price, including the pre-paid first year of service for each unit. Getting Mr. Streck involved made the difference--while Customer Service continued to try a ""Let's talk first"" approach, he apologized for the problems, and issued a full refund, call-tagging the four faulty replacement units.

"I have put a good portion of time and thought into reviewing this product. Overall, I have determined it deserves 5 stars. I have taken several photos which show the condition when it arrived.

Pros:
Pretty comfortable, sturdy, back support, insulated container to place beverages into on the arm, many easy to access pouches, comes with carrying case, price, size (fits in trunk yet still large enough to enjoy)

Cons:
Couple of loose strands (see picture), head part supports up to shoulders (does not support with the semicircle part of the back), extremely wrinkled, number of pockets seems to be a bit much

I love this chair and will be using it tons in the future with my camping trips. If you are considering a chair which will support and last a long time, this can be the portable chair for you. If you are looking for something practical, I would say the same thing, you wouldn't be disappointed. If you are looking for something stylish and clean cut, this may not be you.

You watch prices on Amazon.  These are really small jars.

"What a extreme disappointment this kayak is.  I ended getting a hole right in the seam of the haul right underneath where I was sitting. This occurred after my third time taking it out. I was a couple miles down river from my car and was left stranded with a sinking boat beyond repair. The repair kit would not hold at the seam and I had zero chance of making a safe return.

I emailed Sea Eagle about my issue and had sent them a picture of the hole to which they replied the hole would not be covered under the warranty and there was nothing they would do. So basically I'm left with a useless boat and I just threw it away.

Even though this craft maker claims there is a warranty be very careful you don't damage it because you may be stuck with a whole lot of uninflatable rubber like me.

Also, the foot pump busted after the first use and I just bought a hand pump to use. The boat itself would constantly pull and never tread in a staight line.

I thought about upgrading to the tougher 380x, but after further consideration of their warranty, or lack there of, I decided against spending that much on something that may leave me in the same predicament.",1.0,0

When you take the baking sheet out of the oven you need to use the handles; if you grab the edges with your fingers under the membrane you will deform it and crack some of the cookies.  You do need to be careful with cleaning and storage because the membrane is vulnerable to puncturing.
Overall this sheet is well made and met my expectations for a non-stick silicone baking surface. But because of the size, care and storage I didn't find it to be as useful as I hoped.

If any one of these wore out I'd just turn around and immediately order another one!

You can't go to a junk food drive through and get back home any faster than you can cook delicious meals in this without leaving the house!

One more thing - the food that comes out of this has sooooooo much flavor!  Any spices you use are forced into the meat because its cooked under pressure.  Your meat is tender, flavorful and juicy.  Mmmmm good!  There are so many recipes available and tons of Youtube videos for cooking ideas.  Get one - have fun, and enjoy delicious food in a little time.",5.0,0

You can use it to cut breads without flattening or mashing the bread or to cut delicate fruits and vegetables like tomatoes.  A serrated knife is a must have in the kitchen!

This knife from Cestari Kitchen is 6 inches long and comes with a cover for the blade.  I love this about this knife because we have another serrated knife without a cover and have cut ourselves on it many times just reaching in the drawer.  The cover slides on and off easily but stays on when not in use.  The knife blade is ceramic making it very different than any of our other knives.  A ceramic blade will not rust so I do not have to worry about leaving it in water.  A ceramic blade is also harder than a stainless steel blade which means that this knife will last longer.

I have used this knife on a variety of foods in our kitchen.  I really like using it on bread because with the serrated blade, it will cut through the bread and make a clean, straight cut.  I get more precise slices of bread with this knife.  I also use it when making salads and can cut anything from the hardest carrots to the softest tomatoes.  Since I can cut so many different things, it means that I can cut everything I need to cut with one knife.  This knife is very sharp so I do not recommend letting children use the knife.  I keep the cover on the knife anytime it is not in use for safety as well.

This knife has been a great addition to my kitchen.  Many of our utensils are older and we are slowly replacing them.  This knife has already gotten a lot of use!

"We try to eat a lot less meat and we still use this several times a week. It's not just for cooking meat. Soups, roasts, dry beans, yogurt, veggies, you name it. It does them perfectly.

I have always struggled with tough pot roast, even in a slow cooker. I was starting to wonder if what I consider tender and what other people consider tender were two very different things! I made one in the Instant Pot in 70 minutes and it was the most tender, flavorful roast I have ever had.

I make dairy and non-dairy yogurt in it and it turns out perfectly. (Soy milk is the only dairy alternative I've had luck with, not almond or coconut.)

I now make dry beans in it and love them. So stinking easy to press a button, walk away, and be reminded a short time later. We are now eating a lot more rice and beans as a family and my grocery bill is $100 less now.

I love the stainless steel inner pot. I've never owned stainless steel before but now I'm hooked. It cleans fairly easily and I can wash it in the dish washer.

I love that I can truly make things all in one pot. I saute the onions or bacon in the pot, then dump everything else in, pressure cook, then if need be I add other ingredients and simmer to thicken whatever I've made. The pot is also deep enough that it doesn't splatter. I bought a whole chicken on sale and was able to make the equivalent of a rotisserie chicken for $4.

I've only made rice in it once and wasn't as satisfied with the results as my aroma rice cooker but I honestly haven't tried all the different combinations of water ratios, cooking times, and pressure releases. For now it's just easier to stick with my fuzzy logic aroma cooker.",5.0,0

"I have been using the Centon Electronics Flash Memory Card (S1-SDXU1-64G) for the past few weeks in my Samsung digital camera and also my Sony digital videocamera.

"This blender is excellent!  Engineered well and built well.  I have used a lot of blenders in my life but this one really blends whatever you toss into it. If the lid is not secured properly it will not start (nice feature)!  Lots of power = lots of noise...this has both.  Also, this lower blade is integrated into the pitcher, unlike the other models that screw into the bottom of the pitcher and eventually leak.
Suction cups on the bottom really stick this blender into the counter keeping it from moving...nice touch!

So why not five stars????

Not only does this blender not work with any of the Ninja single blending cup accessories it is not advertised as such.
A call to Ninja confirmed this.
Would be nice if I could use the Ninja single serve blending cups.  The single serve cups allows you to store several days worth of your blended batch into these cups.  The cups can then be placed on the blender and blended individually...(they have a mixing blade on each cup).  If you want this option you need to order the BL830.",4.0,0

"Prior to buying these rings I was working out on a bar, and find the rings to be much more versatile and potent.  They are easy to adjust for height (pullups to dips, for example), and setup was a snap - I have them hanging from an open joist in the garage.  After a few weeks on these, my physique has popped, and strength is increased, I believe it's because I'm using more stabilizing muscles to perform a given exercise.  There are many exercises that can be performed on the rings, even front and reverse flys, which are excruciating and maybe a bit much for me right now, but I never got this level of intensity from bar work.  I also love that they rotate and follow my body's natural form, so there is much less stress on the joints and connective tissue, and I can feel the difference in my elbows, wrists, and shoulders.

"Hi everyone,

For those of you who don't know yet,  this cooling bracket was released several months ago before being quickly recalled due to bad hardware that caused the PCB of your graphics card to bend and make poor contact with your GPU.  Corsair released this cooling bracket again now with shorter standoffs too correct the contact issue.  I do see that there are reviews still stating bending and high Temps.  All I can say for myself is that I purchased two of these for my evga gtx 980ti's.  At first I had a very slight bend and Temps under load were 60-64C.  I was not happy with this.  I started some trial and error.  I installed the HG10 N980 bracket to my PC while running Valley benchmark.  I slowly released tension on one thumbsrew. One by one I basically got no bending of the PCB and now I got 98% GPU use & load Temps of 48C.  What worked for me was loosening up the thumbsrew at the 11 o'clock and 5 o'clock position until I saen Temps dramatically drop.  I am very happy that my 2 980ti cards are now running icy cold when paired up with 2, Corsair H75 AIO coolers.  I will admit that I shouldn't have to do this ""tinkering""  around with this bracket as that's not what it's advertised to do. Anyone who had previously had issues really should give approach a shot.  I'm a passed owner of an expensive custom water loop that ended up leaking one day & fried my $2000 gaming rig.  I know that AIO's also run the potential of leaking,  but I feel that your chances are much lower.  Good luck everyone.

"I am really impressed with the Skyfi3 XM Satellite Radio.  It is lightweight, the right size to fit in you shirt pocket or pants pocket and has the right functionality to serve its purpose.  The sound quality is good with enough volume to overcome most external sounds, in particularly for me, a lawn mower.  Its mobility allows it to be used in your home, car and outside walking or jogging.  You have to purchase the accessories for the home and outside functionality.  I also purchased the home kit since the SKyFi3 comes with a car kit.  I purchased the wireless router in order to transmit the signal from the south side of my house to a location inside my house.  It is absolutely necessary to have clear view of the southern sky in order to receive the satellite signal.  It has worked wonderfully after setting up the antennae outside in a covered plastic container.  The antenna is supposed to be weatherproof but I am not taking any chances.  It took me about 2 hours to read the directions for each device and get everything working.  Even the car installation was very easy and worked once all the parts were connected.  I have had one glitch with the device.  I tried to turn it on one day after not using it for a week and it wouldn't come on.  After much anxiety I read the manual and it explained how to reset the device.  I like most it ability to set up recording schedules for your XM stations.

First the good.  The sound is decent, though nothing special, and the fit is pretty good.  They are very comfortable and don't fall out, even when I'm jogging and sweaty.  My issue with Sony earbuds is that (with every pair I've owned over the last 10 years) the sound in one ear eventually goes out, never to return.  Then they're garbage.  My friends have all reported having the same problem and none of us has been able to figure out what causes this problem.  It does not appear to be something you can control by treating the earburs with special care of any sort.  I personally believe that Sony designs them to die on you, so that you'll constantly have to keep spending another $20 to replace them.  For my next pair (when these inevitably meet their one eared fate), I'm thinking of going higher end for a pair of earbuds that will last.

You can see corrosion from chicken and pork?  See exposed copper which was used as an inter-plating before chrome plating.  Now regular steel wire costs about $1/lb and Stainless Steel costs about $2/lb.  Therefore, for being miserly, by not using good materials two things happen: 1) In ordinary use the plating breaks off meaning you may be ingesting both chrome and copper (ingesting iron won't hurt you, and actually the copper won't either, but I don't really know about chrome.

"I have used this for a few weeks and am very pleased with it.  First, it makes a good cup of coffee, even without factoring in the convenience.  I'm still trying different varieties.  The French Roast is so far my favorite.  By dialing in either 6, 7.5, or 9 oz, it is very easy to adjust the strength to your tastes.  I find even the 9 oz to be strong enough.

The build is very sturdy, better than most of the other pod coffee makers.  Charcoal filter in the water is a good idea for those living in the city.

Only disadvantages I see are that the machine is relatively expensive, it costs more per cup, of course, than a regular coffee maker, and your choices of coffees are more limited.  But if you only want one cup in the morning on the way out the door, it's certainly quick, with no mess, and leaves no wasted, leftover coffee.  I find it of good value.",4.0,0

The bike is pretty small, so he doesn't really have a lot of room for it, but it fits a little snug. I like that it has a couple of pockets on top.

"UPDATE Mar-2016:  I bought a second one for myself.  Overall, it seems fine, and I like the size of the teapot, but the design allows the last drop of every pour to run down the spout.  Buy the time we are done drinking tea, there is a stain at the bottom of the spout.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:  I bought this teapot for my sister who has been looking for a large teapot for a long time.  This is a nice size teapot that is large enough to serve a party of 6+ people.  With a normal teacup being about 6 oz, the teapot holds about 12 teacups.

I like the plain white classic design as it would go with anything.  The overall quality seems to be very good, although the empty teapot weighs less than I imagined it would just by looking at it.  The small loop handle in the front is very helpful for serving because the full tea pot is quite heavy.

One of the pictures of the white teapot shows a lid open that seems to have a built in brewing vessel, however, the teapot I have received has a plain lid.  Not a big deal for me, but something I feel others should be aware of.

UPDATE: After about a year of regular use the teapot is still holding up well and nothing broke or cracked.  My sister is very happy.",3.0,0

"Most travel pillows Id previously used were simply okay; the THERMATEK HEATED TRAVEL PILLOW is one of the most relaxing, comfortable travel pillows Ive ever used.

WHAT IT IS:

- A U-shaped pillow that fits around the neck for support with the optional benefit of heat.

WHAT MAKES IT SO SPECIAL:

- Memory foam with a silky-soft/plush cover.  The memory-foam pad is somewhat firm and provides added comfort and support. Extremely comfortable/cozy and accommodates larger necks.  The pillow itself isn't tapered like most pillows, its slab-like thickness adds more support.

- There is a pocket/sleeve that accepts disposable heat packs.  This is an added benefit for those who are seeking a therapeutic angle to their travel pillow.  The pillow comes with 2 disposable heat packs; additional heat packs must be purchased separately.

I found this pillow to be quite luxurious and useful.  The pillow alone (no heat) is great to use when working at the computer, watching television, reading and travel.  The memory foam and plush cover make this pillow comfortable to use for longer periods than the other travel pillows Id previously tried.  While I like the soothing option of heat, the added cost of buying additional replacement heat packs must be considered (each pack generates about 8 hours of warmth) will temper my need for heat.

Living in southern Arizona hats are a must if you are outdoors. It is hot and we have over 300 days of full sun. I own a tone of hats of all shapes and sizes. I was looking for a lighter weight hat I could wear under my bicycle helmet and for other sport activities. I have a mountain hardware hat that works well but does not have an adjustable strap to cinch it down tighter and the brim is smaller than this one. This hat works well to fill the gap for me. The material is definitely light weight without having a fragile too thin feel and the brim is full sized. The adjustable strap on the back is elastic so it has some flex to it and you can cinch it down as tight or loose as you want. One unique thing about this cap is that the adjustment strap has a clasp on it. I will attach a photo. The clasp is thin so it doesnt bother me even when worn under my bicycle helmet and if you have a pony tail you could unclip the strap and then clip it around you pony tail without having to pull it through like you are probably used to. This is the first hat I have seen with this feature. Very clever. The has is made from a synthetic material so it doesnt hold sweat or moisture and drys very quickly as a result. It has ventilation mesh on the sides to help it keep your head cool. It is not the thinnest or lightest hat I own but is close.

"Purchased four of these camera's the info that comes with them sucks . This is the fifth one that I received the picture was blurry right out of the box. Never had a camera that was blurry right out of the box. I finally hooked it up a video camera, put it on my lap and played with the focus and zoom knobs. Nothing I did would bring it into focus. So I returned this one. I forgot which knob adjusts what, there are no directions to tell you. I didn't matter I played with it more a half hour and nothing worked, so back it goes. I got four good ones, so I reordered it. The four that I am using have been working for about a year and a half They are very clear and have very good night vision. The only problem you could have with these cameras is, that the night vision is so strong, that it might be too bright in close in setting..
Update; Got another one of these, they shipped it really fast. Perfectly focused in the widest position. Mounted it adjusted a little bit. Happy camper  now. What makes a camera like this so good, is, that you can put them anywhere and make them work. It is very difficult to find a fixed lens 2.8 MM camera. So this does it all. A note. I've had one of these mounted out from under the eave where it is exposed  to sun and the rain, no problems. It has been there for about a year and a half. The main weakness of this camera is, the IR coverage. I throws out an intense spotlight leaving the edges in darkness. I would say the coverage is about 2/3 of the area. I used this camera to replace a inexpensive fixed lens camera that fogs up after rain. But that camera covered the entire area in an even light.",4.0,0

"Was easy to setup and works very well. We unplugged the COX modem, but did NOT remove the battery (the instructions say the battery should be removed).

"First, let me say I can't say with high degree of confidence that this waterproofer works. After all, all my observations are totally subjective. Furthermore, I have applied this waterproofer to mostly Gore-tex garments, which are naturally waterproof because they are made of high-tech synthetic materials.

I bought these specifically because my snowboard garments (jacket, pants, and gloves) are made by Arteryx which specifically recommends this product for waterproofing after few washes. Supposedly, Gore-tex loses some of the waterproof capabilities (never completely) after few machine-washes. This is also the same waterproofer Arteryx uses in the production of its garments.

After the application of this waterproofer, the clothes become slightly more rigid after drying. What I have also noticed is that my Gore-tex garments are still very waterproof (but they were very waterproof to begin with).

I have applied these to my leather shoes and it seems to work fine. I live in Los Angeles and it hardly rains here and I don't wear my leather shoes during the few days it does rain. So I can't confirm that it works well for leather shoes waterproofing.

Pros:
1)It seems to work well. Arteryx recommends this specific product for Gore-tex waterproofing after few washes.
2)Easy application. Just spray it. It doesn't have any toxic smell (doesn't mean it isn't toxic). You need to let it dry for few hours.
3)You can apply these to leather shoes without discoloring or negative cosmetic effects.

Cons:
1)Hard to tell the difference between before and after. Maybe this isn't a bad thing.",5.0,0

"I got this as a Christmas gift for my wife after one of the grandkids broke the screen on her last one.  Not very pleased with the quality of the cameras or the screen resolution but it does what she wants it to do. The colors are great it's just a little grainy if your looking at pictures or watching a video and the pictures from the camera are very grainy.  This was a disappointment to her because she likes to take it when we go hiking and use it for pictures.  This one won't work well for that due to poor camera quality. I wanted to get the same one she had but couldn't find it on amazon.  Maybe they don't sell it anymore.  The tagital seems to respond fast enough for browsing the net and playing her games.  The touch screen is sensitive enough.  We only had one issue after a few hours.  It worked great with the included keyboard at first then last night it wouldn't boot up, kept getting an error message.  Then we unplugged the keyboard and it booted correctly.  Haven't tried the keyboard again to see if it was a fluke or the keyboard actually went bad.  The included case is very nice and I like the way the tablet actually is snapped in place.  Much more secure than the one she had with her other tablet.  For the price I paid we are not overly disappointed.  In short if you want to just browse or play games buy it.

"The radio offers pretty solid features. I just had it installed and  pretty happy for the most part. The Bluetooth is excellent, I've had to play with the EQ because it won't sound right out the box, but once you adjust the audio settings, it's a beast. I also turned up the Bluetooth audio level and now Google Music sounds pretty awesome. I like how I an have music and Google Maps running and it lowers the music for directions.

USB - The USB gave me an ""Error 19"" but noticed my Nexus 5 goes into charging mode when I plug it into the stereo. All you have to do is drop the notification bar and change it from ""Charging"" to ""MTP"". I don't carry music so I have no need for it. I actually  wanted the USB for charging, but that's very disappointing. It charges at 80mAh - 110mAh which is poor and means my phone loses battery while plugged in and using Bluetooth. I drove for 15 mins and my battery went down like 8%. Most of my charges never drop below 500mAh, most give me over 1000mAh.

Aux - My Sirius Starmate 2 is using the auxiliary input. It sounds fantastic! I have ditched the FM transmitter and Howard Stern and the music channels come in very clear. I don't know why I waited so long to upgrade my stock radio.

This stereo is connected to my factory Rockford Fosgate and it sounds better than my Nissan RF dash unit. All in all, this radio, parts and install cost me a solid $210 or so. A bit more than I was expecting but worth the price.

2. Buttons light up, can turn the feature on or off

Cons:
1. Buttons lights up and off too quickly, lights do not stay long enough
2. Distance for radio signal is poor, it's best not to have interference or obstacles in front or in between the signal path
3. The mouse wheel is infrared sensor, which kind of works but not as well as a mouse wheel. It's not as precise and you almost always lose track
4. Due to poor signals, I would constantly have to type something on TV and look at the pad, then look at the TV again to make sure the signal took the input, because sometimes it would not.

The strainers come in 3 sizes that nest into each other making them easier to store.

"If you have a small DSLR, you might want to purchase a DSLR for the price.

If you are considering a DSLR, the TRS-F1 is a good choice.  It will cost a little more than the DSLR, but you will have a better picture.  I have the TRS-F1 and it is a great camera.  I just wish it came with a flash.  The zoom is excellent.

The price is great.  I bought a $250 50-100 F1.4 lens for $8.99.  I am glad I bought it because it is the only lens that I know of that I use for shooting at night, and I don't need to use the flash.  I will be buying a second one for the future.

I love that the shot glass is collapsible you can this flask anywhere and have a shot. The flask is sturdy no leakage when tipped upside down which is a big plus. The shot glass fits perfectly on the side of the flask and comes off with ease. This is great for taking in the club with you instead of paying for outrageous drink prices slip this in your jacket pocket or purse and you have free drinks all night.

"Sub Sports has my outdoor-compression-layer business for life!

I have arctic compression leggings from other big-names, and these blow them out of the water!  The fit is perfect, compression is even and full-length.  They feel like second skin, breathe well, wick moisture well, yet retain heat like a wool blanket.  These are better than Mil-spec ECW poly-pro, even with a base-layer added!  They also don't have a strong rubber smell, nor do they retain odors like some of the other brands do.

They do tend to ride a bit high on the waist if you opt for a larger than necessary size (looser fit), so be aware of sizing before purchasing.

I used the size charts on the Sub Sports website, and got a perfect fit.  If you are an athletic-build, or even average, then follow their sizing and you can't go wrong.  If you are muscular-bulky or have a few extra pounds, go up a size for a better or looser fit.

I also got the zip-top to match, and following the size chart would have put me in a large, but my son has this in a large (which is too short/tight in the sleeves for me), so I opted for the XL for better fit in my shoulder/arm length (I have broad sholders and 34-35"" sleeves), and the compression is still nice and snug top-to-bottom.

A word of warning... do NOT DRY THESE IN THE DRYER, or you'll never fit a toe back into them (or they will rip apart)... they must be line-dried or hung from a hanger.  They dry quickly so don't think it will take all day.

I wore a pair of these leggings kayaking last spring, and even though water was constantly getting me wet, within a few minutes of getting out of the kayak, I felt dry at the skin, and was NOT cold the whole time.",5.0,0

I am known to carry around a mason jar as my drinking glass on a regular basis. These glass mason jar mugs are right up my ally, so I was super excited upon finding them. They are perfect for drinking or using as packaging for gifts. They are wonderful as a base for decorations, the uses are endless.

"The product is good - the blades are sharp, the whole device feels solid and heavy in the hand, and it does work on meat as advertised, however, there's one significant point where the product description is false.  The product listing says that this specific model is ""Made in the USA"" and it's NOT.  The packaging on my Jaccard Super 3 clearly states ""Designed in USA. Made in China.""  So that little bit of false advertising made me deduct one star.

EDITED:  I just read the other reviews, and one reviewer pointed out that this $37 item is the exact same product as a $17 item that's being sold by another 3rd-party seller.  I actually did notice the other seller's item before I purchased mine, I just chose this one because the description says it was made in the USA.  Again, it's NOT made in the USA, it is made in China.  The seller's description is basically false advertising. And if it's the exact same item as the one that's less than half the price, then that makes THIS product at THIS price a total rip-off.",2.0,0

"I bought this vacuum cleaner 3 months ago and absolutely love it!! I am 69 and have a lot of difficulty maneuvering my heavy Kenmore canister vacuum anymore. I have had other stick or similar size vacuums before, but always ended up being disappointed in their performance. Not this one!! This machine is very light but does a fantastic job at picking up dirt in spite of its size. I like the fact that the ""footprint"" is not wide like the usual uprights as it can do a better job of going in tight spaces. I like the transparent cup which is easy to empty without getting dirty hands in the process, the fact that you do not need to buy paper filters, the easy to disassemble construction if you want to give it a thorough cleaning. I also like the sponge type of filter that you just need to rinse thoroughly when too dirty. I actually bought additional filters in case I needed to do soso I would not have to wait for it to dry. The first time I used it I was shocked at the amount of dirt and cat hair I amassed! This was the only time so far I have had to disassemble and clean the inner tube. You know you have to do so because you notice that the suction then is poor.
As you can see, I am tickled pink! This is the perfect vacuum for seniors or small apartments.
The only thing which would make it better: a handle on the front at the cup height to help hold it when vacuuming say stairs or sofa.  A hose attachment would be nice too but can be easily be done without the old fashion way (broom/ brush and rag) For the price and the performance and ease I do not believe it would be fair to remove a star.

"I usually don't carry my Mosquito at all, but for those rare times that I do I wanted a comfortable, workable holster. Even though I didn't have any prior experiences with any of their products, Fobus has a reputation for good quality gear so I bit. Generally it does the job well, but this holster is still a tight fit after a couple of weeks of trying to break it in (snapping the gun into place and then removing it repeatedly). This works better at gun removal when the holster is worn on my person because of how tightly it holds onto the Mosquito, although initially the draw motion was almost more effective at removing the gun AND holster off my body rather than just the gun itself.

A few scuffs have shown up on the forward edge of the gun's trigger guard as a result of the tight fit, but it's not something I usually fret over for something as basic as a .22LR pistol. On the person, it fits well and is comfortable enough, but as with any gun of length there are certain positions with me that don't work as well, like sitting. Drawing the gun is still something of a challenge (requires a very firm, well-intentioned pull) because the holster seem like it does try its best to keep the Mosquito held in place; good if someone's trying for your gun but not so hot if you need access in a hurry, or just want to take it for any other reason.

"My H2O mop gave out after a little better than a year; I should have taken an extended warranty as offered, but, then, how does one send the darned thing back if the original box for shipping hasn't been saved?  My problem early on was I felt the floor was so wet when I finished and took a long time to dry; I called the company and a woman I spoke with suggested going over an area with mop on and then click it off and go over the same area again without the steam being expelled.  That was fine.  But was it the frequent clicking on and off that caused the mop to eventually cease to work?  I took it to a repair place near where I live, but they could do nothing with it.  So I'm out the mop.  I've gone back instead to the Hoover Floormate, which, really, is a much better piece of equipment...and does do grout!  We have an older Florida home with terrazzo floors, and the Floormate is ideal on them, as, in a way, was the H2O mop.  But the Floormate both expels and draws up moisture.

The two smaller displays at the top are a bit small (I had to buy a pair of sunglasses with ""cheaters"" built in - yes, I'm over 40).

The fuel is not just alcohol you know. The colored flame comes from the oil/alcohol mix. The right mix gives you a great flame. This product is the best I've used in a long time.

"Great fluffy waffles! Clean up isn't as easy as the standard one I had. The mouth of the iron is made of a plastic that batter STICKS & HARDENS! It's not what I was accustomed to with my other waffle iron that was constructed with all non stick materials. If you don't clean it while it's still warm, you'll be scraping it & the crumbs will fall inside the iron. It does take less space. The measuring cup doesn't have a spout so it's messy to use while aiming for the mouth. I found that our recipe needs 3/4 of the cup since the batter rises. If you have any OCD tendencies, the excess baked in the mouth might be bothersome. (I would have no trouble eating the excess, but my husband cuts off the excess &throws it away! So far I estimate that he has thrown away 1/4 waffle for every 6 waffles he has made...so the batter won't make as many as before. still looking for the appropriate measure).

"I really wanted to like these as I read so many good reviews, and they look great when worn. First off, I have deeper eye sockets and always have had challenges finding goggles that don't leak.

After seating the goggle and tightening down with a firm, yet comfortable tension, these goggles didn't leak for about 500 yards. Then a small leak started, which i think was from the outer edge. Fortunately, the water didn't funnel directly into my eye, however it was a distraction. After pausing my swim, drying my face and goggles, and tightening things down even more, the goggle didn't leak for another 100-200 yards then water came in again. I tried several other times to reposition and tighten things, but this model just wouldn't work for me. Side note, I ended up with large raccoon eyes and a major headache from tightening things down for at least 24hrs after my swim. I probably should have conceded sooner :(

"Looked at the top 4 brands of these: Wagon, Koolatron, Cooluli,and Igloo. Didn't necessarily ever need warm and didn't want to wait 5 weeks for delivery so that eliminated one. Then after looking at reviews bought Coleman and Igloo to compare and a generic converter (Shumacher 6v) since it looked like they didn't come with any. (Not sure if I ordered Igloo 375 or 374 model) Purpose was for long drives in and out of hotel rooms to dog shows.  Wasn't sure if the hotels we were using had refrigerators or not.  Upon getting both Igloo hands down was better (Coleman returned)  for these reasons:
1. Cord came off the unit completely as shown in photo
2. Vertical or horizontal option w/shelf
3. Read truck driver reviews and they liked this one best
4. Shelf

Loaded cooler the day before travel to save time morning of travel. Day 1, left the house with a full cooler of frozen and cold food/drinks, got to the  hotel, plugged it in. Took what we didn't need daily and put it in hotel fridge. Done. First day at show: Forgot the adapter and left cooler in car in shade (90 degrees) and 12 hours later things were still cool inside.  Continued back and forth from show to hotel. 4 days later drove home.  No soggy food, nothing freezer or ice burned. What we didn't eat on the trip was still usable.

Awesome item. Saves time, money, food, and don't know why I never got one before! Simple.  No loading ice every day and repacking the cooler.",5.0,0

"I used one of these on a build I did for a friend and was very impressed with the quality. It was matched with a Vortex Strike Eagle 1-8. A quality mount is important as the best optic is useless if you match it to junk rings. That said I didn't want to spend as much on the mount as I did on the mount and had read good things about this mount. The rings are uniquely hinged. The mount itself is well machined and very light weight. Aero has gather a good reputation for itself by making good quality items at fair prices and this mount is exactly that.

There are a few things to be aware of. Because of the way the rings are made the scope has a tendency to turn in the rings when they are tightened. You can try to compensate for that. Or you can apply a light coat of oil to the ring/scope allowing them to move. The second is that because the mount is aluminum and the screws are steel you need to be very careful with your torque. The mount comes with a allen wrench and instructions which I recommend you follow carefully and you will have no issues. Do no over tighten as it is easy to strip the aluminum threads. All in all this is a fantastic mount for a very good price and a great optic for an ultra light build.",5.0,0

"This Clever Yoga non-slip yoga mat towel and hand towel set are really great! My yoga mat is 6 feet long and has grip on both sides, so I wasn't really sure I would need a yoga towel all that much. I have to admit that though I didn't really slip on the mat previously, I do feel more secure with the towel in place. I'm a newbie at all of this so I will take every precaution I can so I don't re-injure my already injured knee or anything else. The towel fits my mat perfectly! It keeps my mat so clean and does a great job at absorbing any perspiration from a good yoga session. It is recommended that you missed water on it to increase its nonslip properties.  The workout towel is a really nice bonus and I appreciate the added touch. My towel set is a super pretty rosy pink color which matches my mat nicely. (If I order another set, I'd really like to get that gorgeous vibrant orange color!) I've also noticed that this towel is great for the pool or anything else you. It is seriously huge and I love to put a towel on an outdoor lounger chair anyway, so why not get the most usage out of this town but I can? It also wraps around you very well if you like to be more modest at the pool. It is a very generous 24""x72"". Both towels have great absorption too. I heard some others feel that their towel wasn't soft, I washed mine before using it and had no issue with that at all.

As a chemist, I do find the ""silver ion"" coating quite cool as its antimicrobial action really does work to keep the towel from smelling musty.

"I bought my first set of these headphones about a year ago.  I was able to look past the annoyingly long right ear wire because they do have excellent sound quality.  I used them mainly at the gym and noticed that after being on the treadmill for a few minutes that the combination of sweat and the weight of the cord would pull the left earpiece out.  I tried all 3 rubber sizes but was constantly pushing that left piece back in.  Also, when lifting weights I run the cord under my shirt and found that the thick rubber piece where the right and left earphones split would catch my shirt and again pull the left earpiece out, even more often than while running.  This was annoying, but I would still have rated these 4 stars because walking my dog or listening in bed these were the best phones I ever heard.

So we found out we needed some tools, this had good reviews and we purchased it. One thing you notice when handling it is that this is very sturdy with some weight on it. The edges are not dull either. While I don't believe they are the sharpest edge you could get, they feel like they could cut through some stuff. I am thinking we might sharpen the edges.

"Ok, first let me say that I ordered from Western Frontier, and the MREs I got were totally genuine and as described, so that's good.

The rest of this is my review of MREs in general. This is first time I've ever had one. I bought 3 to bring on an over night hiking trip.

Pros:
They contain EVERYTHING you need to eat them, you don't need a spoon, fork, or even a cup (they have a beverage bag you can use just in case). They also contain little niceties like a moist towelette. This makes them excellent to just throw them in a pack and go.

If you assume 3 per day, they have plenty of calories to keep you going. I definitely wasn't hungry. One thing I wasn't expecting though is that most MREs come with a large pouch of peanut butter or cheese spread, so you have to be prepared just like.. eat a bunch of peanut butter out of a tube if you want to get the last 1/3 of the calories.

The heater packs work awesome and are really convenient. They're pretty light too, so they don't feel like a waste of weight.

Cons:
A downside of everything being included is that these are pretty heavy, and a lot of the weight is wasted on things you only really need one of, like the plastic spoon these come with. On the plus side, the plastic spoons are so heavy and durable that I'm going to put them in with my regular silverware.

Flavor wise.. I'd call them neutral. I eat lunch at a gas station most days, so I wouldn't say I have a refined palette. I'd put them on the scale next to canned food. Like it's not bad, but you don't really look forward to it unless you're hungry.

Overall, I'd say I'm happy with my purchase, but I'm glad I didn't go and buy a whole case right away.",3.0,0

The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because it's a bit of a pain to install. You can't get it to actually charge it up, but it does have a short USB port so you have to plug it in first to get it to work. I have the TV plugged in to the wall and I can't get it to even start working. Also, the remote is pretty annoying. I would have given this 5 stars if I could.I really like the case.

"I was really looking forward to this Vantec hard drive dock because I have several Vantec products from years past that have nicer streamlined designs and built solid compared to the competitors.  I figured this new hard drive dock would have a similar solid feel.  But the FIRST TIME I attempted to remove a 2.5"" drive, the door flap broke off!  The drive got snagged against the door flap and it took only a slight pressure to pop it off and break the plastic.  Then I realized that this plastic flap is not even necessary, it's just an alignment guide, so I removed it as shown in the photo to expose a larger opening.  It is easy to line up with the SATA connector to insert a 2.5"" drive even without this silly door flap (unless someone is blind or working in the dark).  I am happy with this hot rod ""mod"" to the unit.  Now the next disturbing aspect is how bright the LED is.  I mean this thing lights up the entire room!  I can use it as a flashlight.  I don't understand why the neighbor down the street has to be able to see the LED shining through my window blinds.  Other than that, it works nicely with excellent plug-and-play capability and transfer rates.  On the bottom of the unit it says Made in China which explains the quirks.

I keep half a dozen of them in the back floorboard of the car -- when I stop at the store, I just grab them and clip them onto the one already dangling there as a reminder...  I end up with a multi-colored daisy chain of bags.

When I get home and carry my bags of groceries up -- I just toss the empty bags on the table, and when I sit down with a cup of coffee -- I start stuffing them back into their little pouches, and clipping them back onto my purse.

As long as I never leave without my purse -- I never leave without my Chicos.

Haven't been without them since.

And now everybody I know will be getting them for their birthday....  :D

I keep both the regular shopping bag size for produce and heavy things -- and the Vita size which are much bigger and really good for carrying paper good and chips and such.",5.0,0
I paid $89. 99 for this and it arrived on time. I will keep my review in order to share my experiences. The headphones fit snugly and the sound is clear.

"It took me awhile before I really needed it, and it saved my vacation.  Firstly, when I received it (fast shipping) I mounted it under the water bottle cage and it fit in nicely.  Most of my friends didn't even know I had a pump with me.  I stashed all the other goodies in my bag guessing I wouldn't really need them.  I was wrong.  We took a trip to the upper area of Wisconsin in a location where the closest people are 10 miles or more apart.  As luck would have it, we broke down.  The car just stopped and later to find out it was a clogged fuel line.  So off comes bike and I'm ready to roll for help, but oops!  Flat tire!!!  No problem, I have a pump and it would have done a stellar job but I'm afraid it was the tube that burst.  UGH!  Thinking I couldn't do a repair in the woods I was wrong.  I had everything I needed to do the repair.  It was a life saver, because we were more than 20 miles from the nearest help.  The Mini bike pump worked great, I was even able to put in 55psi in my balloons.  Since then I used it just to top off, and it had worked great.  No issues.  Thanks Blanst!

"So, I purchased this net for a different use than most of you likely will.  I go canoeing a lot, and it's not feasible to haul an anchor around when portaging along with all of my other gear (fishing gear, food, beverages, etc).  Instead, I used some plastic zip ties to tie one end of the net together to form a mesh bag of sorts, and I put rocks in the net to use it as an anchor along with some light rope while I'm fishing.

I specifically purchased this net because some of the reviews said that it was a nice heavy and durable material, and they weren't wrong.  Since my net drags on the bottom of lakes full of 15+ pounds of rocks while I'm fishing, it needs to be durable and this one has delivered thus far.  At $5, the price was right too.  If it can survive rocks and the bottom of lakes, I'm sure it will hold up nicely for its intended purpose as well.",5.0,0
"I have always liked Wacom products and that includes its Bamboo styluses. The one I have used before just had a pen clip which actually worked well for my iPad case. I have always liked the styluses that are able to plug into the headphone/speaker port because I don't use it often so I it makes sense to have a solid place to keep my stylus with my iPad.

This product is reminiscent of the elago, which also has the retractable and speaker port pen feature. It also includes some colored rings that you can swap out for customization, though I think the silver looks the cleanest and most expensive.

The functionality is fine. It writes well and fits in your hand well. I'm just not a big fan of the girth of the product but it does allow for better grip and writing. However, the rubber grip does make the product look a bit cheaper, as it has dots in them and holds onto lint and dirt strongly and easily.

For the price, I think the elago is a much cheaper and comparable option. This product just doesn't look as sleek and clean as the other styluses in both elago or Wacom's repertoire.",3.0,0

"I bought this based on reviews, composition and price.
I needed a protective case for my portable HDs and in researching, decided to try this model.  I am not comfortable with soft cases and felt that some form of hard case was necessary for protection.
The case measures externally approximately 7"" x 4-1/4"" x 1-3/4"".  The interior storage cavity measures approximately 6"" x 3-1/2"" x 1-1/2"".
The outer covering is a tight weave synthetic fabric laid over a stiff plastic shell.  All observable stitching is single-stitch.  From what I can feel, the plastic does have some give but is reasonably stiff.
The interior has soft, fabric covered foam padding covering only one flat side and not the edges. It appears to be approximately 1/4"" or less thick.  There is a 1"" wide elastic band for HD retention.
The other side of the interior (which has no foam padding) has a mesh pocket approximately 3"" deep by 3-1/2"" wide.
The exterior of the case has a fabric pocket measuring approximately 3"" x 6-1/2"".  There are no straps or velcro.  The material appears to be some form of thin neoprene.
I noticed in the reviews that some mentioned that the zipper can be faulty.  In my particular case there appears to be no problem and zipping the case open or shut presented no discernable difficulties.  Long-term durability remains to be seen..  The zipper pull has a oblong hard rubber tab attached to it.
This case fits my portable HDs with room to spare.  The elastic band holds the devices securely, although how long it will retain adequate elasticity remains to be seen.
I use the exterior storage pocket for the HD cables as I am not comfortable having the cable with the USB connections rubbing against the HD on the other side of the case interior.
I feel that this case is adequate for casual use but I would like to see if there are cases with foam padding all around.",4.0,0

"For starters the head phones worked and were way better in staying in the ear when doing laps and flip turns. The packaging was great, and they came with all sorts of swap out buds for all different size ears. The problem and the reason I'm writing this review, is I noticed that about 2 weeks after receiving them and using them in my daily 1 mile swim, that one of the headphones was barely working. I thought it may be due to water getting in my ear and drowning out the noise. This wasn't the problem because the very next day the ear bud stop working permanently.

"For YEARS I held onto my old kodak EasyShare, it was one of the first ever produced! I loved my old one, but wanted something a bit more updated to take on my vacation abroad this summer. This camera's features are terrific: the LCD screen is large and easy to see, the functions are very user-friendly, the fact that is uses batteries is a huge plus while traveling, and it's size is small enough so that it doesn't take up too much room, but you'll never loose it in your purse and be able to have it readily on hand for those special (but sometimes fleeting) shots. The quality of the shots is not the best, but a little touch up using some photo editing software can certainly clear that up (the software that comes with the camera is convenient and easy to use, but it will not produce professional quality pictures like a bit of work with photoshop can).

fit-comfortable, and comes with different sized extra inserts.
you definitely hear the tunes, very clearly, but bass is not there.
for that i wear regular higher quality headphones (over the ear type).
price is right for what your getting.
picked yellow so i could easily find them and cable.

PART II
after using them for awhile, i've upgraded my opinion of them to ""great"".
very comfortable as compared to apples things, which are very uncomfortable and sound pathetic.
sound is really CLEAR and crisp, i like that alot.  there is bass, but not like a good pair of headphones, its not blasting at you like a rappers car stereo in the hood. but its there if you have a good ear.

bought another pair as backup, new puppy likes them too :)

No remote port, so you can't film a show without holding your arm up high on the zoom rocker. I had wanted to mount this on a camera boom arm-but no way to remote control it. I am going to try the Lumix G7 camera, as it has 4K photo burst capture-easy access. And it does have a remote port! When I did film, picture was over-exposed. Not sure if factory set it up this way. Anyway, the build quality seems suspect-SD card slot is underneath unit-can't change it when mounted to tripod! I wish Panasonic would make how-to videos showing all aspects of this video cameras use, instead of 2 minute promo vids with nice music. Even Youtube has mostly unboxing vids. I have used Canon G@0's for years, and Sony products as well, all have remote ports. Not sure why this new trend-maybe using smartphones to control it remotely? Hope this helps.",2.0,0

"Love this!  Let me share the best two recipes ive found to make, the first one makes a 2 lbs loaf and the whole wheat a 1.5 one.
French bread:1 1/3 cups Water; warm
1 1/2 tbsps olive oil
1 1/2 tsp. Salt
2 tbsps Sugar
4 cups bread flour
2 1/4 tsp. Yeast
Original recipe makes 14

servingsResize
Preparation

Place the warm water into your bread pan. Be sure the kneading paddle is in place. Then add the olive oil, the salt, and the sugar, in this order. Add the flour, covering the liguid. Make a small indentation on top of the center of the flour, but not deep enough to reach the liquid. Add the yeast to this indentation. (Adding the ingredients in this order is important, especially when using the timer. It keeps the yeast away from the liquid ingredients until it is time to knead them together. Liquid ingredients will prematurely activate the yeast.) Now you are ready to set your bread pan in the machine and set the timer or choose the French Bread Cycle. This recipe makes a 2lb loaf.

Whole WheatFor 1 1/2 lb. bread machine
1 1/4 cups water
2 tablespoons (7/8 ounce) olive or vegetable oil
1/4 cup honey or maple syrup
3 1/2 cups (14 ounces) King Arthur 100% White Whole Wheat or Traditional Whole Wheat Flour
1/4 cup sunflower, sesame or flax seeds, or a combination (optional)
1 tablespoon vital wheat gluten
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast

"The Dell USB 3.0 Dual Display Universal Dock D1000 is sleek, compact, and works very well.  Having used past Dell USB docks, I can say this new model does not come with the compatibility issues of prior versions.  The ability to utilize dual displays, plus it's compactness make it a great option on your desk.

The D1000 doesn't come with an abundance of ports, but it's does the job.  If there were one flaw it might be the ports, but it's hard to fault it with the multiple video outputs, network, audio, and more than enough USB ports.  I tested this with two 24"" displays.  I used multiple computers, including a few different laptops and a Surface Pro 3.  This included Windows 7, Windows 8.1 and Windows 10.  I had a great experience with all variations.

The dock itself is fairly compact and go on top of your desk or on a shelf or other alternative.

The other two cameras I've tried, both have excellent sound and are easily adjustable.

The only downside is that the battery life is a little short, but it is still usable.

Overall, I'm very pleased with the camera and recommend it to anyone looking to get professional DSLR photography.

"I bought this to carry my 29"" Trek Superfly on the back of my 2005 Chevy Impala (with spoiler). It fits very well and is very sturdy. I have full confidence it will carry the bike well and won't fall off or break.

A couple things to note... If you have a bike with a full suspension you'll need to buy the top tube bar separately. Allen makes one and it goes for about $15-20. Without this you won't be able to mount the bike on the supports due to the suspension being in the way. I recommend buying it regardless as the bike will sit much cleaner on the rack.

Also, make sure the bottom strap that goes to the underside of the bumper or bottom of the trunk is secured VERY WELL. Pull it a few time to make sure the clip doesn't pop off. There is nothing really good under my Impala's bumper to grab on to so you have to be sure it is secure. This may only be the case with my car but just thought you should know.

All-in-all, this bike rack is great and well worth the (actually low) cost.",5.0,0

"I got this for toting my work laptop back and forth, and it is perfect, most especially for the price. There were no noticeable finishing issues.

Nicely made, with decent padding in the straps and back. There is sufficient room for a large laptop, cords and cables, some notebooks, and whatever else I need for the workday. It would not have been sufficient for school textbooks and the like, but is more than adequate for work.

I'm very petite, and while the bag is small, the straps and overall design are a bit out of scale for me, so if you are small also, you might feel a bit like a tortoise with too big a shell.

"I had a sony P-200 camera 7.2mp to replace it with the Canon. My friend bought a Canon G-7 to replace the Sony (We have the Same Sony Camera). We both got in to the hype of all the reviews. We both tested the canon cameras quite a bit. Both Canon(s) has more options then the Sony does. But the Sony overall picture is much sharper and the colors are more realistic and natural. I kept my Canon just cause I was in so deep, I had already received a 8 gig SDHC Card, had a rebate on the Epson Printer so I ended up keeping the Canon and sold the Sony. It was a hard choice, knowing the sony picture quality is that much better. My friend on the other hand is selling his New Canon G-7, ""too bulky and its not worth it to lug it around when the Sony P-200 takes better sharper pics."" I agree, the Sony picture quality is better then the Canon 850IS. I can affirm that! The only thing is the Sony takes average low light pics, but the Canon 850is is no world beater in that department either. When it comes to day light shots, the Sony wins hands down over the 850is and also according to my friend the sony beats the Canon G-7 in outdoor photos ""not zoomed"". Like I said the Canon(s) has more options, and some might counter that you need to manaual play with the canon to get a better pic. But really who wants to mess with manual settings on a trip overseas? How many pics will you miss? The Sony P-200 has as fast boot up as the Canon 850IS and takes pics much much faster with the flash when it comes to multiple pics. And the sony flat out takes better pics. No doubt the canon is a excellent camera, but its questionable as to how good compared with a sony that came out in 2005...the Sony has less options, but has great image quality and ""sony Style"".",3.0,0

This TV was 429, does 1080p and has tons of hook ups.  More than most people will need.  I also own a 55"" LED Sony TV, and I dare say picture quality is barely below the sony, and may look better on cable, due to the compression used, and the fact it doesnt need to strech the compressed image another 15 inches.

My only complaint for all TCL TV's at this time, is the lack of universal remotes being able to control them.  I have a 2 TCL TV's right now (the 32 inch and 40 inch) and my Comcast DVR remote cannot control them.  Their is no code in the manual for TCL at all, and when you use the ""Search for code"" feature, i went through it about 200 times, and could not get it to shut the TV off.  I have also read may posts about people having this same issue.  As best as I can tell at this time there are only 2 remotes confirmed to work with these TV's 1 being a 29 dollar logitech and the other being a Sony universal remote for about 15 bucks.  Thats why I knocked off 1 star.

Other than that so far this TV has been great, gives good picture quality, and OK sound from a normal TV setup.  Definately a great bedroom TV for Videogames, TV, Movies, etc.  Could even be used as a living room tv depending on the circumstances.",4.0,0

"There are several choices when it comes to cooking utensils: Stainless remains my favorite choice given that it is dishwasher safe, sturdy enough to hold up under force, and thin enough that it can easily get under the cooked product. Silicone, also dishwasher safe, has the advantage of being good for teflon-coated pots and pans but the disadvantage of rarely being tapered sufficiently to get under, say, a sunny-side up egg, without damaging the appearance of the food. Bamboo is a great alternative; though you have to hand wash wood utensils, wood is generally stronger than silicone and can still be used in teflon-coated cookware. The trick, though, is that it has to be cut properly.

This set could have used a little more in the finish department. The colored handles are a nice touch, but the half that touches food is rough to the touch, not quite sanded sufficiently, and doesn't come to as thin an edge as is necessary on the spatula tools. Further, the slotted cuts on two of the utensils had left a few bits of little wood splinters that I needed to make sure were thoroughly removed when I first cleaned the items. The wood was also finished with a light outer coating - some type of urethane? - that wasn't smoothly applied. There are areas which lack the coating, and some areas which appear to have blotches and extra coating.

So overall, the set is ok, particularly as a lightweight set for a camp or RV stove, but at home you would likely be better served with two or three higher grade utensils than this set.",3.0,0

"This is one of the best Mac laptops on the market, period.  (The best PC laptop on the market, in my opinion is the Sony VAIO Z series with the high res screen option).

I recently traded the 15"" for this 13"" and although I greatly miss the 15"" screen and the wonderful speakers on the 15"" (the 13"" speakers are good but not as rich and bassy as the 15"") but overall I love this smaller machine.

Let me get what I don't like out of the way:

--wish the screen resolution were much higher (compare to the Sony VAIO Z series which has such outrageous screen resolution)
--wish it were a bit lighter that 4.5 lbs (although this machine is exceptionally sturdy, so willing to deal with a little bit heavier than similar size machines)

And that's it for the wish list.  Now what I absolutely love:

--the ergonomics -- way better than anything else out there, PC or Mac.
--backlit keyboard, comfortable typing area (feels luxurious to rest your hands on the surface of the textured aluminum area)
--fast OS (Snow Leopard), fast machine, great power management
--first machine i've owned that doesn't get overly hot, in fact even barely warm

What I do highly recommend though is to get -- if you can afford it -- is a 256Gb SSD (Corsair).  This gives the machine extra speed, better battery power, and true longevity.  No need to worry about damaging the disk while traveling, defragmenting (oh, so glad that era is over).  This is an expensive option ($650 or so) but really well worth it by a long shot.  The SSD equipped machine will last you a long time.",5.0,0

"This is the second Yakima rack I've purchased and this one was for a trip from KY to GA via AL. First thing I noticed when it was delivered was the solid construction; it's heavy and solidly built. Assembly requires attaching the rack arm to the hitch with a single bolt washer/locking nut combo. Full assembly (on vehicle and ready to go) took around 15 minutes. Put two mountain bikes on and made the trip with no problems. On a factory receiver, the rack sticks out far enough to not be a problem scraping the bumper and swings out far enough to have zero problems with hatch clearance. At first, I didn't get the threaded bolt tight enough so it wobbled a bit, but on the return trip I tightened up a bit and there were no problems whatsoever. I wouldn't trust any brand other than Yakima.

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because of the threaded hitch pin and space when loading 2 bikes.

Pros:
- Solid construction
- Swings down for hatch access
- Rubber straps secure bikes without harming paint

Cons:
- Tight fit for two bikes, but manageable
- Threaded bolt for receiver is not as easy to use as a standard hitch pin

Other Thoughts:
- Loading two bikes is tight. You can adjust where they sit (move the frame supports) to give you a little more room, but it's still a squeeze.
- With two bikes loaded, swinging the rack down/up in a controlled manner to get into the hatch is a little difficult.
- I will probably be buying a new washer/lock washer combo for the threaded hitch pin for added ease of mind, but the provided one(s) are sufficient and keep things in order.
- Be sure to securely fasten everything; things look like they might be bouncing around, but there is no worry of things popping loose--if it's secure, it's sturdy.
- A mid-sized crescent wrench or a 3/4"" socket will fasten this to your receiver. I recommend the socket as it was easier to work with.",4.0,0

"The Garmin ""Bluecharts"" are vector charts, which means they use mathematic algorithms to store all the lines and features of a nautical chart.  I have steered away from these in the past because they tended to give up a lot of detail vs. ""Raster Graphic"" charts, which are essentially photographic images of paper charts.
With ""Bluecharts"" they have gotten to a level of detail (including multiple colors) that they look almost as good as a paper charts.  The advantages of vector charts is that they take up much less room on your hard drive and run much faster on a PC.  This is important when you are zooming in and out to see your depth or proximity to a wreck while moving on a boat.
I use mine with an eTrex Legend and am able to load most of the detail (depth, obstructions, nautical aids, etc) onto the handheld.  For the full look of charts, I connect the GPS unit to my laptop.  The package also includes tidal charts, which are much more detailed and accurate than the little tide chart booklets I used to use. Overall, it makes navigation a breeze...your boat is automatically represented on the chart and you have many simple tools to calculate distance/time to a given destination.  It also incorporates additional information on Marinas and service locations.
The Garmin application the charts run on, ""MapSource"" allows you to easily switch between map types.  I have ""Americas Bluechart,"" ""MetroGuide"" (streetmaps), and ""Tides and Marine Services,"" all without having to reconnnect the GPS unit.
The only hassle is the ""Unlock"" process, which is a bit time consuming and involves providing the Garmin website with a bunch of codes, including the serial number of my GPS unit to unlock a set of charts from the CD-ROM.  I'm not sure, but I think it will only work with that specific unit, which worries me a bit as I am thinking about buying a second unit for backup.",5.0,0

"This is my second set of these glasses.  The first lasted over a year before I decided to replace them.  Of the several different types of glasses I have tried these were by far the best, they fit well, fogging was minimal, and the molding did not obscure my vision.  This pair however only lasted a couple months (used about half a dozen times) before a plastic film on the lens began to flake off making them unusable.  I spoke with Amazon, they would not refund or replace due to it being over 60 days.  They suggested I contact the seller.  The seller it turns out is only a distributor and I was referred to ESS to complete a warranty claim.  I called them and was told I could get a replacement lens for about $20.  I told them that was unacceptable for something that should have and has in my experience lasted much longer than a couple months.  So after a few emails and about a month of waiting I did receive a replacement lens at no cost.

I understand that periodically manufacturing errors will occur even on the best products but it's frustrating when nobody wants to rectify the problem. Overall I'm happy with the product but very disappointed that Amazon, Sportsman Supply, and ESS were so reluctant to stand behind this product.",2.0,0

"I own several Gerber knives, and overall I like the them, Gerber makes a solid knife. However, like most Gerber knives the steel used in this blade is average, 440 high carbon. It does not hold an edge that well and dents/chips fairly easily. The added features, i.e. sharpener/whistle/fire starter are nice. Although the fire starter is crap, it broke on the first use with minimal force used. The sheath is fantastic, more impressive than the blade in my opinion, very durable. The grip of the knife is also quite nice, comfortable and sturdy, no slip at all. All in all if you are an occasional outdoors man and looking for a decent affordable survival knife this is a good buy. But if your looking for a blade thats made of better steel (Aus8) and overall durability and blade retention quality and still at decent price, I would suggest the SOG Seal Pup. No bells and whistles. Just the blade but it's a fantastic knife and if purchased from amazon not much more expensive than the this knife. Basically if you want a knife that if your life depended on it, I would not go with this Gerber, go with an SOG or maybe a Kabar. Bear Grylls is a badass and there is no way he would trust his life to this blade.",3.0,0

"It appears that Arcos has skimped to make this a cheaper model. A MAJOR negative that the potential capacity is really a lot less than perceived. This is due to the inconceivable absence of ANY expansion via SDHC cards or any other flash cards. The greatly limits flexibility. It is always an important idea to leave a considerable amount of empty space on the locked up, internal flash of the unit, as performance several degrades, as the internal flash fills up. As it gets around 70%, besides the performance issues, sort issues, there is a much grater chance of database and OS, issues, because of the needing of large work areas, that are not available. Not allowing external expansion from SDHC, truly helps this situation. I guess this also forces Archos customers to HAVE to get propriatary Archos units and drives to expand at all.

"I bought the 8CH 4 camera system for our office.  Our office is all on one level and the width of the office is about 150 feet.  The main NVR unit if located about 80 feet from the farthest camera with only a partial wall between the unit and farthest camera.  Out of the box the system is easy to use. The screen you use to specify the time the cameras should record motion is cumbersome because it is a grid of rectangle 24 (hours) x 7 days and if you make a mistake you cannot uncheck a box and thus need to start over.  The android app for viewing the cameras works well and so does the desktop app.  If you need more than 4 cameras , all you need to do is buy the additional cameras , up to 4 more for a total of 8.  Pairing the camera with the system is easy.  If you need the signal to go through cinder-block walls you may want to consider another system.  I had one camera in our warehouse at about 200 feet away with a cinder block separating the warehouse from the front office NVR.  I got intermittent results in terms of the signal reaching the NVR.  Other reviews I read stated you can replace the antenna's on the cameras to boost the range and signal strength, but the antenna's on my camera do not twist off nor could I pull them off.  These cameras detect motion and it may be helpful to realize that ""motion"" is anything that causes pixels to change.  We were getting false motion alerts because sunlight bouncing off of outside nearby moving traffic was reflecting on a wall and the camera nearby was picking this up.  In terms of ""night vision"" the cameras work best if there is a little bit of light.  If I needed to buy a system for my house I would consider this system.",4.0,0

"Great stove. Easy to clean (when needed). Easy to maintain in the field. Parts are plentiful everywhere in the world. This stove will burn just about any fuel you want to put into it, though I don't suggest kerosene or gasoline. I bought this stove and used it faithfully for 20 years. I updated my stove recently to a Snow Peak Giga-Power with auto-ignite. Despite loving my new stove very much, I keep this stove and still use it from time to time on cold day hikes to boil water for tea. It has NEVER failed me in over 20 years no matter what I put it through.

If you are looking for lightweight backpacking stove and you may be traveling with a few people or overseas this may be a great choice for you.

If you want less weight and don't mind a slightly longer boil time (per qt), go with the Giga-Power with auto ignite by Snow Peak. The fuel canisters are readily available at most backpacking stores or online. I can boil water for tea (for myself) and all 3 meals for 3 full days and nights on one of the small canisters (8oz. or so) in moderate to fair weather. They weigh less than the liquid fuel+bottle you would be carrying with the MSR Whisperlite. Still a great stove hence the 5 star rating.",5.0,0

"I had this trasmitter for 2 years. It outperformed my firends and families transmitters by being compact, no cords unless you want to charge it. The transmitting wire is on the outside which gives it a stronger signal even though it runs off the Ipods power. The only drawback is that....it runs off the Ipods power and drains it after a good day of driving, unless you plug it in to a mini USB port cigarette lighter power thingy which you can grab at radio shack. I had to buy another one because I pulled the wire out of it not realizing it was the transmitter cable......not my brightest moment. But just press play and within 4-5 feet of my radio I had crystal clear music with NO STATIC. I could pass it around my car without interruption and people could play what they liked.

"This diffuser works quite well.  Please see the 3 pictures I uploaded.  The figure was 5.5"" high and 3 feet away.  The wall was 14"" behind the figure.  Pictures were taken at 70mm zoom setting (full frame equivalent of 105mm).  Even with the camera at automatic mode, I still had to increase exposure by +2/3 stops to get equivalent exposure as the picture w/o diffuser.

If your lens does not rotate during focus, then you should attached it close to the front of the lens.  When you zoom to telephoto, the diffuser is pushed even farther from the flash, making the diffused lighting even more effective.  This is great for macro photography.

The diffuser is rather large (12"" total height).  When attached to my Nikon 18-105mm lens with a 67mm filter, the hole and the elastic band are almost at their maximum.  The diffuser flops in the wind a bit and will flop even more if your lens is smaller.  I found it easier to mount the diffuser with the lens cap still on the lens.

The carrying pouch is much bigger than needed.  You can just wrap the folded diffuser with a rubber band and put it in your pocket.  I don't think getting it slightly dirty will affect the use of it at all.  Overall, quite happy with this diffuser.",5.0,0
"This is a nice little pot for boiling water.  It holds almost a quart which surprised me since it looks smaller.  I have yet to take it on a hike but I expect it will work well as it is light and strong.

The major flaw in the design is that it won't hold the little fuel canister because the hole for the lid is too small.  My hope had  been that I could put the little etekcity stove and a fuel canister in there.  If OuterEQ had opened up the lid just an 1/4"" more it would have taken the fuel canister and probably the stove.  Oh well.  I'm otherwise happy with it and I'll stuff something else in there.",4.0,0

"I needed some summer workout shorts, and I didn't want to spend a lot of money. I've never been a big fan of the regular Soffee cotton shorts (the length has always been off on me), but I gave these a shot based on all the good reviews.

I have to say, overall, I'm very pleased. I'm 5'2, with a little bit of a butt, and about a 37"" hip.  These fit alright in the medium, but I could've gone with the smalls probably (I just ordered a pair of small, will update when they come in).  The mediums are a little loose in the leg and in the waist.  I like the cut on these a lot- angled in toward the crotch so the outside of the leg is higher than the crotch, and a shade longer on the back than in the front.  It's a flattering cut that's nice and airy without showing everything.  The waistband is nice and comfortable, you can roll these but you don't have to.

The only reason they didn't get full 5 stars is the lining is pretty thin; I wouldn't buy them in lighter colors, especially not white.  I got black ones and they're fine, but lighter colors would probably show any colored underwear.  I'll be working out in these all summer, and probably lounging around the house in them too.  Like I said, I ordered a second pair, and if those fit, I might order yet more in the smaller size.

Edit: I like the smalls better.  For a 36-37"" hip, a small is a good fit; they stay up easier than the mediums still without giving a muffin top effect, and they're no more sheer than the larger size.  I wear the smalls to the gym now and wear the mediums around the house.",4.0,0

Have been trying to find an inexpensive headset like the Nike pair that I had and loved.  These are not as inexpensive as the Nikes but if they last longer, they will be worth it.

I like them and plan to stick with these - have had to return a couple of types I recently bought.  The sound is good, not  great, but for running and podcasts its what I need.  They are very comfortable.  You can wear them both over and under the ear, which is really nice.

"I received this Allen Sports Aluminum 2 Child Trailer/Single and Double Swivel Wheel Stroller for an honest review. Heres my take on it:

As a stroller there are other options that assemble and transport easier than this one, however, if versatility is what you're looking for, look no further. This one works for one or two child transport plus doubles as a bike trailer. Zippered panels keep out bugs and rain and the interior is roomy. The item sets up quickly as either a single or double-wheeled stroller, and when not in use folds easily with quick release wheels for easy storage in your trunk or a closet.

I appreciate the fact that the Allen company is family owned and has been in business for fifty years, however, it was a bit off-putting to see the Made in China label stamped on the cardboard box. The fact that each item is backed by a lifetime warranty eased the disappointment of it not being USA made.

Please note the shipping box is enormous. Fortunately, the item takes up far less space. My daughter is taking this stroller on a visit to relatives in Australia. We were concerned about it exceeding the dimensional requirements, but the helpful staff at Quantas suggested we collapse the stroller and have it bubble-wrapped before adding it to our checked baggage.

Note: the assembly instructions state this stroller is not for children under 12 months of age. Also, though assembly is pretty straight-forward, it was difficult for me to unfold and lock the hinges. It required the extra strength of my husband.

Theres a safety flag and the materials used in construction seem to be of very good quality. This stroller is on the pricey side, but Im a firm believer in you get what you pay for.
Two thumbs up for this sturdy stroller.",5.0,0

They are very well constructed and the base at floor is heavy enough that you won't worry about them getting knocked over too easily. The wires run up through the middle which is great and bases are slightly grooved up on rear to allow wires to pass through without making the stands sit uneven. They come with rubber feet so they won't scratch my wood floors and if you have carpet, they also come with little spikey type of nails to help them stay put.

We have multiple iPads with different movies and TV shows on each.  With the iPad storage limitations I had to pick and choose periodically to remove and add movies.  With the Seagate Wireless everyone can watch whatever they want.  I copied almost our entire DVD collection as well as our iTune movies to the Seagate and now there's never a shortage of something to watch.  I have a 6 year old daughter and entertainment on the go is a must.  We also connect the iPad to our T&C van and watch movies stored on the Seagate on the car DVD screen.  The picture is not as crystal clear as when a DVD is playing but we're willing to sacrifice a little clarity.  We recently went on a short (maybe 1.5 hour trip) with 5 kids in the car ranging in age and this was a life saver.  The kids could hear and see the movie perfectly.

"Another top quality product by SKLZ.

I'm using the lateral resistor to train my 8 year old son in speed/agility/quickness. I can also use it myself. The cuffs for the ankles are comfortable and fit children and adults of all sizes. they fasten together with strong velcro that doesn't separate when the product is being used.

The resistance band in between the velcro cuffs gives you resistance whether you're shuffling laterally or taking big steps forward, backward, or diagonally.

This product doesn't come with its own case, but that doesn't matter because it's small enough to pack with whatever else you're using during speed training.

It comes with a two sided poster and a DVD. The DVD gives you a very good demonstration of several Lateral Resistor moves (in addition to the exercises you can do with other SKLZ products), and the poster gives you a six week program showing you when to perform these moves. One side of the poster is a workout program for the Lateral Resistor. On the other side is a workout program for the resistor plus many of the other SKLZ products.

Every SKLZ SAQ training product comes with the same DVD and the 2nd side of the poster is the same for each product. One side of the poster is always devoted to training with only that product.

It's a good accompaniment for a complete SAQ training program.",5.0,0

"When it comes to golf, I have been a beginner for the last 25 years or so. I've always lived within a couple of miles of one golf course or another, and so it seems that it's the natural order of things that I'll get invited to play at least once a year. Here lies my predicament. I don't play enough to drop serious golfer cash on a set, but over the years I've grown tired of having to borrow a set or rent the bowling shoe equivalent of a set of clubs on those infrequent occasions. It seems my solution has been found in this Callaway Strata Plus set.

There is no denying that this set is a starter set. But I think that anyone who has had experience with starter sets would agree that this is a pretty high quality starter set, considering the retail price point. The clubs are sturdy, and, at 6'1"", I didn't find myself hunched over, as I have in the past with other inexpensive sets. This set also includes every club a beginner to casual golfer would need to get through a round of golf.

It might sound a little ridiculous, but the bag itself actually adds quite a bit to the value of this set in my book. A common problem with starter sets that I've tried to manage in the past is that the bags would be so cheaply made that they seemed to begin to dissolve prior to the back nine. The Strata bag is not super high quality, but its quality enough considering the price point. It is easy to carry and includes a stand (the one dead giveaway of the guy who never golfs is the bag laying beside him on its side emptying all its contents every time he stops to take a shot).

I know this set is not going to be turning any heads or impressing anyone who is a regular golfer, but it's better than the dreaded rental set, and certainly meets the needs of an intermittent golfer without sacrificing the kids' college fund.",5.0,0

"I needed a updated router for more devices and stronger signal.  After a lot of research, I settled on the D-Link AC3200.  The router was very quick and easy to install.

So far I have two issues with the router:
1) During setup, I was given the option of changing the router name and password, but the changes would not process.  The install wizard just sat there no moving forward in the process.  I tried again with the same result.  I finally kept the factory given name and password (which in reality is more secure than the password I would have chosen).  The wizard continued and shortly completed install.
2) Our devices randomly drops connection to the router, but will automatically connect about 1-2 seconds later.  So far, this has not caused any issues with streaming video/music/movies.  I need to research this more.  This may be caused by the router switching devices to a different band to spread the bandwidth demand evenly.

The router is considerably bigger than our old one.  This will require more space than you may expect.  This router is 15-21 inches wide depending on how you arrange the 6 antennas.  The suggested arrangement is to set the antennas at a 45 degree angle.  The router is 21 inches wide with this setup.",4.0,0

"I love this gun. It almost perfectly represents the M3 it is supposed to be, and functions very well. But it shows some flaws to me that many have not covered, so I will tell you them.
Pros:
What everyone else is saying, good spread, good range, etc. BUT, the range is moreso ~50ft for hitting a man-sized target 9 out of 10 times, not 100ft. But this is a shotgun.
Cons:
Not the easiest pull-back I've had on a gun (but realistic, + for me)
Not the lightest thing in the world (Actually, a pro to me in MilSim, I like my guns a little bit beefier)
The shells-
A. They tend to jam
B. They are crappy plastic and don't look very real
C. They hold 30 bbs, which is good for most, but not for me in MilSim
D. They get scratched SO easily by just common in/out of the gun, and this really sets off my inner-OCD
The sling mounts are under your buttstock shell holder (if you have one) and this gets to be very annoying when your shells fall off the back whilst you are running. Honestly, that is where the real mount is on the real gun, so that isn't this gun's fault.
Lastly, poor weight distribution. It just doesn't feel like the real thing.
So, you may be bewildered that I gave this gun a 4.5/5 when a majority of it is cons. But pretty much the pros section is agreeing with most of the other reviews pro section (I hope this isn't hard to understand). In summation, I really do like this gun when I don't run an aeg. It is perfect for CQB and back-yards (it isn't a dangerous FPS for those situations). I would reccomend this to anyone who wants a good, reliable gun for under $100. Thanks for reading.",4.0,0

Cons:

- Pinches your fingers badly, really, really badly.  Seems impossible, I know, but seriously, it hurts.  The plastic they used is just wrong for this application, it's so stiff it I'm typing this on fingers that are raw from having to spread it open to put the cables inside.

"I really like this vacuum. Charges quickly. One charge does every room of my 1000 sq ft place. I have hardwood floors with a good amount of dog hair and it does a pretty good job with it. Very easy to empty the container. (Which you will need to do after every sweep.) I recommend making sure you clean out the rollers and intake port fairly frequently. It is a compact vacuum and that's what makes it easy and great; but the intake port is pretty small. Just keep it clean an it will work great. It picks up debris well, gets into tight spots and corners, gets fairly low so that you can get a good ways under beds and couches.

EDIT: 6 months later. I still think this is a great vacuum for the price. It will vacuum about 6 rooms (900=1000sq ft) before needing a charge. It picks up most things well. It works well on pet hair and basic dirt. Bigger things take a couple swipes. You should definitely clean out the intake as much as possible because it is small and can get clogged. It doesn't take long to clean it, but it is a little work. Just a screwdriver or wire coat hanger is needed. The battery charges quickly (maybe an hour or two?) and it hasn't seemed to lose any of its total charge in the time I've had it.

Edit: One and a half years later. This vacuum was a good vacuum for the time that I used it. After a year and a half it has now stopped working as well. Very little suction power. Doesn't pick up dirt like it should. I need a new vacuum now.",3.0,0

"My interest in this 8"" pan was to satisfy my longing for the perfect over easy egg.
In my quest = I had already purchased Calphalon Unison Slide frying pan and was very pleased with it.
So much so that I gushed about it in a review 2 - 3 yrs back.

Turns out this pan is even better = nicely browns the egg - cooks evenly and quicker.
And because it's completely grease-less non-stick, it only needs wiped out with paper towel.
Has a very adequate and comfortable silicone handle = doesn't get hot.
Stands up to what one would expect at this price point, and it doesn't disappoint.

> This is outstanding construction and indeed 100% non-stick.
The triple bottom is an excellent heat conductor. Cooks well on medium heat.

> About being able to use metal utensils with this pan = I found that a bit contradictory.
While product description says yes, the pamphlet with the pan says = they strongly recommend not to.

> And while it is said to be dishwasher safe, same pamphlet says = yes, but due to hard water and detergent
the non stick coating may lose its effectiveness. So I would interpret that as a no.

> Can be used on all stove tops = gas - electric - vitro ceramic stove top - induction - halogen & in the oven.
Pan does not come with a lid, but any 7 7/8"" (rim inset - to rim inset) lid will fit well.
In our cupboard = a Chantal = Revere Ware - & Calphalon lid fit perfectly.

Made in Italy
(We have some other pans and utensils from Italy of which have turned out to be some of our best & favorite kitchen items)

Manufacture states this is scratch & stain resistant.
10 times more resistant to sticking than normal non stick coatings. (which I believe is true)
18/10 stainless steel
PFOA free

No grease.

"I have teenage boys, 3 big dogs, and 2 cats.  I vacuum daily, and I'm hard on my vacuums.  This is my 3rd Hoover Wind Tunnel variation... and I like it the best, and the suction is fantastic, but it is heavy.  Heavy to carry, heavy to push.

THE GOOD:
+ Fabulous suction pulls up all the pet hair you didn't want to know you had.  ""Multi-cyclonic"" suction; previous model was ""Dual Cyclonic"".
+ 7 settings for carpet height.  The previous model (Wind Tunnel 2 Pet Plus) had 5. Not sure that you need 7 but I guess some houses do.
+ Retractable cord - same as the previous model but longer by 3'.  Love this.
+ Rinseable filter and ""one button"" cup emptying (more on this in The Bad).
+ A great hose which, like on the previous model, 'clicks' to pull out/put back so you know you've got it replaced correctly -- but this hose stretches 5' more (to 15').  Great for stairs and ceiling fans!
+ 3 onboard tools (+ standard telescoping wand)... I like that they stay ON.
+ Wider (15"") head.  This is good and bad in my opinion.  You can get big rooms done faster but it doesn't fit under some things.
+ Folding handle!  Great!  Now fits in the closet!

THE BAD:
- Not 'steerable' - though I didn't take off for this as it doesn't say it is
- HEAVY!  Heavy to push and to carry,
- ARGH.  I still hate the cup-emptying!  I don't know how to solve this but I'm not an engineer and presumably someone at Hoover is  It's true you just hold the cup over the trash and push one button BUT the door swings away as the dirt is falling out...meaning that the door gets covered in dirt and is awkward to clean off as it hangs, swinging and spreading gunk, over your trash.

GREAT for pet houses, lots and lots of suction and conveniences... might be too heavy for an older person.",5.0,0

These have a heavy base and an easy to grip handle.  The only reason I gave them 5 stars is because the box is a bit small but the plastic lid does hold it together.

"Dropping to 3 stars as it is not really ""non slip"", the white dots are not scratchy whatever to keep you in place, they are just deeper pieces of plastic.... Definitely not a step stool you want to use if you are actually wet, like out of the swimming pool or bathtub wet... unfortunately it took a fall for us to look at it a little closer and see they were not slip grip things.

"If you're looking for a solid, sturdy, high profile, dovetail scope mount, this is it. Unlike two piece mounts, this mount makes me feel very secure that my scope will never fall off. The three screws provide uniform pressure and inside one of the mounts there's a small screw to provide downward force to ensure this mount never moves. I also used a little bit of blue loctite on each screw to make sure they don't loosen.

The mount also includes all 3 sizes of allen wrenches to tighten everything.

It says the mount is for airgun/.22's but I use it on my Savage 24 which is a .22 Magnum and 20Ga shotgun combo gun and my scope is still zeroed perfectly after many shotgun rounds.

"This sight was really impressive for the money. At ~20$ you could have a high-contrast bead. The circular contrast of fibers with the light channeling is what makes it pop. I shoot clays and have a few different brands and this bead would look nice on any of them. As other reviewers have stated, don't expect this thing to be gigantic. It seems compact because of the nested fiber colors, where a solid bead would take up the whole space. The odd thing to me was that the bottom is not completely flat. It has a small raised area near the screw post, maybe to keep it from rubbing off a finish? This will not hold on its own and does need some sort of adherent (loctite, etc.) As you can find on handgun forums, this is a great front sight post replacement for handguns too.

"It is definitely not as big and strong as the industrial cages you find at the gym, but its perfect for a workout room or basement at home.  The cage is relatively light weight, I can easily slide it around or pick it up and move it.  If you are throwing up any amount of weight, the entire cage slides backwards when you throw the bar back to re-rack it on the barbell catches.  It would start sliding on me, but I just pushed it up against the wall.  But the primary reason for only 3 stars is the bench.  The base of the bench is a T shape.  This is great if you are laying back as the legs the jet out provide support.  But when you are sitting up or using the leg extension, you are basically sitting on a rail.  It is wobbily and not sturdy feeling at all.  After two months I have gotten used to it, but I wish the bench was of higher quality.  The seat portion of the bench has 3 settings to incline it, but they are about a quarter inch apart.  The entire seat barely inclines an inch.  When incline benching its hard to fight the sensation that your body wants to slide down the bench.  Also, raising the back is not the easiest thing.  It takes some force.  And finally, the wheels on the back which allow you to roll it down are terrible.  I am 6'3 and I have to lift the bench way up high just to get the wheels to hit the ground.  My wife who is 5'5 can't get it to roll on the wheels.  She practically has to lift the end above her head.  We purchased a rubber mat to put under the unit, so it is a pain to slide the bench on and off the rubber mat.  The cage is great though, its everything I needed for a basement workout area.",3.0,0

"Bought this to try for reducing wind noise while motorcycling.  The directions were clear, and the product was easy to use.  I wound up using a little less than half of the mixed compound for each ear, and it worked fine.  The thing is they do not reduce wind noise much at all.  Had much better results with the ""shell""-type plugs like eargasm.  So while the product did harden fully and form usable plugs, I cannot recommend for motorcycle riding.  Also tried them off the bike, and in comparison to standard plugs they do not block as much sound for other activities like mowing the lawn.  They are, however, much more comfortable than standard plugs as they do not exert as much pressure on your ear canal.",3.0,0
The lithium-ion battery allows this to run a long time on a charge. There is however one flaw that hopefully B&D can address. The filter attachment can be confusing to some and the filter may become unattached at which point the motor is sucking in the dirt.

"This came just in time to try! My daughter and I just baked a cake for my husband's birthday and the door bell rang with this delivery! I opened the box to find a well crafted cooling rack.  I had an older model drying rack that rusted and frankly was junk. I am pleased that this is made of stainless steel.  It is plenty wide enough to hold two round cake tiers without issue.  It has ample spacing to allow air to the cake, but are close enough to not damage our cake.  Best of all, the cakes removed easily and did not stick at all to the drying rack.  The raised legs allowed the air to circulate around the cakes.  Clean up was equal awesome! I rinsed in the sink, since there was really no cake on it and left in the drying rack. It dried sparkling clean. The cooling rack is also smooth. I ran my hands over it to ensure there was not any defects and to my pleasure, it was completely smooth.  I am so happy this came today and would definitely recommend the purchase to anyone who enjoys baking.

"I have had many Sony Walkman's over the years. The sound on this one simply does not compare. It is an easy to operate, fairly sturdy device, but in my opinion is way over priced for what you get. And that isn't the main issue. The problems started after I had it for a few months. I would plug it into the my computer and it would not register as a connected device. It would charge and show the battery screen on the Walkman but the computer couldn't detect it. I had to plug it in and unplug is several times to get it to work. Then it stopped registering no matter what I did. I wondered if my computer driver was corrupted..even though it worked fine on other devices.  When I bought a new laptop and tried to connect it again...same problem. It would charge but fail to go to the screen that showed it was being detected so I could not load music. It would instead either attempt to play a song or go to the charge screen without registering on the computer. I went into settings and used ""restore factory settings"". It made no difference. I then used the hard reset on the unit in hopes that would work. No go. If these were not priced so outrageously I might chalk this up to a bad unit and buy another, but for what you get...and with the issues I have had....not worth it.",3.0,0

"I am so pleased with the ODOR Absorbed Activated Charcoal NATURAL Deodorizer Bag by UBERPAKK. In the past the only option I thought I had was placing one of those charcoal tubs in my bathroom or closet which works pretty well but doesn't look nice at all. This will eliminate the odors and yet be non-imposing on my decor or be forgotten in my closet.

I put one of these right smack dab on the top of the tank of my toilet of my guest bathroom which is only used when we have guests. It goes great in there and also looks very decorative. (So much better than having the charcoal tub sitting on the floor). I put the other one in a guest room closet. I really hate going in one of my rooms, opening up a closet and it smelling musty.

"I previously owned both a dustbuster and an electric stick vac and figured this would be the best of both worlds and it pretty much is. Basically, it's a dustbuster attached to a motorized floorbrush, so it's great to avoid having to bend down with a dustbuster. Although, you can remove the dustbuster from the stick and use it all by itself for countertops, etc.

The battery life on this unit is great! I own this model and the one without the lithium ion battery. Not only does this one (lithium ion battery) have more suction power, the battery lasts much longer and I believe it is worth paying more to get a better product.

I would not purchase this for carpets/rugs. This did not perform well on area rugs and kitchen rugs, it just doesn't have the suction power for that, so you'll still need a vacuum for those items.

The other thing I didn't love was how hair could wrap around a tiny piece of the metal motorized brush and wedge in between two pieces of plastic, requiring fine point tweezers to remove the offending hair and allow the unit to operate again. They should have put some sort of cover over that tiny piece of metal to prevent this from happening. I will be having to pull out the tweezers a lot on this!

I don't want to talk the unit down because I do love it! For picking up light dirt, debris, and hair, it does a fabulous job, without you having to bend over. Even picking up the little kibble debris from the dog, it does great, but if you're looking for maximum suction, you'll need a vacuum for that.",4.0,0

"Best value non smart tv on amazon. This review is of the 39 inch model. I did a lot of research and at the time this was by far the highest quality and best value at this price point and size. It's not a smart tv but most smart tv's apps are hard to use and poorly implemented besides I have an xbox and chromecast so I don't care about it being a dum TV.

Picture: super bright amazing image quality for the price point this tv will not disappoint! Extremely customizable image settings allow you to adjust the picture just how you want it. A quick google search will yield settings that work well but I had to fiddle with the backlighting and black levels to get it how I thought looked best.

Sound: other reviews say sound sucks on this tv. The sound is actually quite good as long as it's not mounted to the wall. When wall mounted or pushed up against the wall the sound sounds tinny like how your cellphone speaker sounds when placed speaker down on a table. When the tv is on a tv stand one foot from the wall it has great, clear very loud sound that is more than adequate for my use. That being said a external subwoofer and/or sound bar would be advisable for anyone who likes a lot of extra ""BASS""

"I have three of these in various sizes for my two children (currently 1yo and 3yo).  We almost never go to the beach or water park without these. Without them kids get cold in minutes and get cranky.  With these my kids stay warmer longer and get to enjoy themselves.  I STRONGLY recommend shorty wetsuits for kids.  (We even needed them in an indoor waterpark and my kids lasted much longer than others who didn't have a wet suit - when normally my kids get cold easier!)
These specifically are great since they have a zipper in the front which makes putting it on and off much easier.  A hint for putting these on - they are tight (and should be) so especially if your child is wet sometimes we lift them up by the wetsuit to get it to slide up their legs.  The wetsuit holds up fine to this ""abuse"".  My kids wear these over their regular bathing suits (including swim diaper for my 1yo).  Then if they are in the sun without going in the water I just pull it off.
To wash I put it on the gentle cycle with a smaller amount of detergent than normal - I then line dry.  So far so good!

"Want to know the bane of an electric car?  I will say that it's a pretty good electric car.  The motor is solid and takes the guesswork out of how much power it needs.  It does a good job of pulling the fuel out of the car and does a great job of avoiding the nasty gas smells that can occur in the car.  It also has a nice height knob that adjusts the height of the car.  I like that the car has a motor that is adjustable from about 1,000 to about 1,000 watts.  That is a big plus.  I am happy with the car because it has a nice weight to it.  The only downside I have is that I don't like the ""gift"" feature.  I wanted something that would be easier to use and I thought the gift feature was a good feature.  I gave it to my friend and she loved it.

"I purchased this at Bed Bath and Beyond 15 months ago. It squeegees the glass very well, and the suction cup fixture stays up. (It detached just once, in the seasonal change from humid to dry weather.) No rust, and the rubber blade has stayed flexible. The folding design keeps the squeegee off to the side, out of sight.

Yet, I'm unhappy: the folding pivot point has loosened over these 15 months. If it was just a bit ""wiggly,"" that might be okay. However, the pivot and its fold-lock mechanism are obviously parting ways. The squeegee is no longer effective because the blade cannot be held perpendicular at the end of the swiveling handle.

My experience with this squeegee is similar to other ""simplehuman"" products I've used in the past. They look well-designed, with an aesthetic similar to Oxo and other neo-design products. But, their engineering has invariably incorporated flaws that eventually destroy the product's usefulness. I'll be replacing this squeegee with one from another manufacturer, and not purchasing from this line again.",2.0,0

"I bought the deluxe model (has front wheels).  It's gone to the beach 2 times and to Great Wolf Lodge one time.
It's a great catch all for when the older kids peel off shoes, clothes, etc and disappear. It's got a thin deep pocket on the backside big enough for a couple magazines or snacks.
The top is mesh so wet things can dry out and sand can fall off things.
The back axle has rust on it.  I understand that is my fault for not cleaning it properly after exposing it to salt water.  But it stil works fine.
Not sure what the weight limit is, but my  4 yearold has even sat on the solid bottom piece (mesh piece folded back) when he is exhausted.  (make sure the child knows about not putting fingers in wheels).

"I bought this used off of EBay, but I would recommend this computer to anyone out there. The main reason that I say that is Apples are built to last, I don't mean the case or the screen or anything like that. What I mean is Apple does not make a bunch of different configurations of computers in the same year. There are two or three models out there a year and they are all priced over $1000, why, because they last.

In the past year I have upgraded this computer in three ways.

1. Went from 4GB RAM to 8GB RAM. Want to have a fast computer, just add RAM. I have never had an issue with that.
2. Upgraded the Hard Drive to a 120GB SSD, wanna talk about speed. 9 seconds from hitting the power to surfing the internet.
3. Removed the Super Drive and added a 1TB Hard Drive for storage. I don't know of an HP, Dell, Gateway, Acer, IBM or any of the other PC companies that you can do that with. (Admittedly once I got a Mac I never look anything up about a PC again).

As for performance, I have no complaints. There is nothing that I have attempted to do that I have had an issue with this computer. It seems with a PC that within a year some of the Software out there outperforms the specs on a computer that you just bought when you go down the PC route.

Here is what I would say to you. Sure you can buy a $300 PC from WalMart or somewhere, I bet that it might be in the trash or sold within two years.

 As far as sound goes the highs will make your ears bleed, mids are very nice, vocals and live music sound nice. I'd say if you like to hear quality in your music these will do that but if you like hard rock,rap or anything with needed bass response look elsewhere.
I paired these with the 6-1/2 model of these in the rear side panels and I can say they are better rounded and have tons more fuller sound. I'm thinking of replacing these with them in the front as well.

Its actually a lot more stable than I would have thought it would be, and the drawers do hole quite a bit of fabrics- you could easily put two dozen fat quarters in each one with room left over. So, not good for storing patterns, but good for other things and pretty stable.

"I wanted to revitalize my early 2011 MacBook Pro.  The drive itself works mostly as expected (about 12% slower than its specs).  But the installation was arduous and can be expensive.

First, the drive is formatted for Windows and all the software provided is Windows only.  So you need to use Disk Manager to erase the disk, rename it to something meaningful, and reformat it to Mac OS Extended Journaled.  Then you need a piece of software like Carbon Copy Cloner to mirror your existing hard disk onto the new SSD.  CCC is a great software package, which you should probably own anyway for various backup tasks, but if you don't already have it, buying it adds to the expense of the upgrade.

The provided installation guide is a pamphlet of 8 pictures for installing on a desktop, 6 pictures for installing on a laptop, and 1 frame of cautions.  All very generic and useless for my MacBook Pro.  By the way, both sets of pictures show a SATA-to-USB adapter cable for cloning, which was not included and must be purchased separately.

The installation requires a 7mm to 9.5mm space adapter for 2.5 drives.  Again this is an additional purchase as the Samsung SSD is more shallow than the original drive.  The actual physical installation involves removing the cover, removing the drive clamp and old drive, removing the 4 stud screws on the old drive and putting them onto the SSD, applying the spacer (be sure to orient the drive to the cable connector before adhering it), seating the drive (it still seemed a little loose), re-installing the drive clamp and replacing the cover.  The studs are required on the new drive to make sure it seats into the clamp.  Why Samsung couldn't spend an extra $.0005 and include these on the SSD is unknown.

So, overall 4 stars for the drive, 0 stars for the lack of Mac installation support and the required accessory expenses, averaging out to 2 stars for this review.",2.0,0

"I received this South Shore Sebastian 4-Drawer chest at no charge, as part of the Amazon Vine program.  However, I always try to review items as if I had actually paid my own hard earned money for them.  With that being said, I do not think this chest is worth nearly the price that it is currently selling for.  It is made of press board.  It does seem durable enough so far, but press board just cannot compare to real wood for longevity and durability.  The hardware is very nice, and looks expensive.  The finish on the press board looks nice as well, although it is obvious that it is not real wood.  The drawers glide easily.

I give kudos to the manufacturer for including wall-mounting brackets with this chest.  The item seems steady enough on our wood floors, but falling furniture is a frequent cause of injury and death in young children.  It never hurts to be safe, so we have all of the furniture in our toddlers bedroom fastened to the wall.

This is not a large piece of furniture.  According to the specifications here on Amazon, it is 30.5 wide x 16.2 deep x 41.5 inches high.  I think it is a good size for baby or toddler clothes, but as a child gets older, it will not have enough storage space.",3.0,0

"This is a comparison of 3 travel mugs I own: Contigo Snapseal, Contigo Autoseal, Thermos King.  I only use for hot coffee.

Temperature:  The Autoseal is king hereit holds the temperature ridiculously well, due to the combination of the lock on top and the finger button on the side.  Its a clear 5 stars.  King is second, with Snapseal right behind the King.

Size: The Snapseal holds more, without being cumbersome, so if the 20vs16 is important to you, this is a bonus.  The King is better than the Autoseal for one reason to me- it fits under the 3 Keurigs I regularly use.

Use:  The King is indeed king herethe slide switch is easy, and the deeper lid means spills are captured easily.  Also, you can slide it open and then drink at your leisure, without holding a button downand it comes in handle and non-handle versions.  The Snapseal is a 4 star herefor the first 1/3 of the cup, its smooth, but after that, it tends to spill a little, and no button required here either (plus it has a nice side grip).  The Autoseal is a 2-star herethere is almost no room for spillback, and you have to push in a button every time to release a liquid (hence why it probably keeps liquids hotter).

Cleaning:  All are pretty easy to clean, although I get the best warm-and-fuzzy from the Autoseal, since the bottom part snaps loose on a hinge to allow the suds to get into more parts.

Bottom line- if temperature is your thing, and you're ok with a button and some small spills, go with Autoseal.  If fitting under a Keurig and a good balance of temperature and use are your thing, go with Snapseal.  If ease of drinking with good temperature control is your thing, go with the King.

"Beejays has this wonderful easy to use spiralizer. It helps to minimize the prep time for your food preparation. Spiralizer is sleek and durable. It is compact enough to fit in your kitchen drawers. It comes with a cleaning brush and a free rotary peeler. This peeler has three blades for various cuts. It has a smooth surface, a small size ridge maker, & a large size ridge maker. This would be great for cutting potatoes into ridged potato chips.
  You use firm veggies to work best in the spiralizer. I used potatoes to make a mashed potato dish; carrots, cucumbers, and sweet potatoes to make a veggie stir fry; and also made a spiralizer veggie salad with pasta and Italian dressing. They were all fantastic additions to my meals. This spiralizer also comes with a free recipe book to help you on your way to eating healthier.

"Quality and quite nonstick

I bought a ""Scanpan Classic 11-Piece Deluxe Cookware Set"" in 2007, and they have been great non stick pans, serving me well for nearly a decade.

Even with a lifetime warranty, I can't expect the skillet's nonstick surface to last forever.
My SO doesn't know how to cook on low heat and we abused the heck out of them.
My fry and sautee pan from that series have lost quite a bit of their ceramic coating and were no longer non stick.

So I figured I'd invest in something that I know would last a life time.  A skillet that can't be destroyed, dishwasher safe, etc.
Enter the CSX series.

I picked up the 10.25"" fry pan, which is the perfect size for cooking bacon and eggs.

It is super great, beautiful, and has a comfortable handle.  I've had no major problems with sticking (teaching her how to cook with proper heat), and cleaning it is a breeze.
I actually use a ""The Ringer Cast Iron Cleaner XL 8x6 Inch Stainless Steel Chainmail"" to scrub clean it when needed.

It heats evenly and maintains heat (as evidenced when I pour sink water in it to steam clean it, and it boils for quite some time).

I had also bought a ""DeBuyer Mineral B Element Iron Frypan, Round"" carbon steel skillet as well, but she must have put it in the dish washer as it's all rusted now.  So I think I'll buy a second CSX fry pan.  These things will last a lifetime with no maintenance needed.",5.0,0

"I don't have sleep apnea, but I sometimes snore at night. In addition to using nasal strips, I purchased this made-in-America SLEEP JOY BLUEFLEX GEL MEMORY FOAM CONTOUR PILLOW to help cut down on my snoring. As the name suggests, this pillow isn't a traditional shaped pillow and is contoured. Depending on how you place the pillow, one of the bumps is larger than the other one.

I have used this pillow for about six months. It has helped cut down on the snoring I do at night.

Play around 2 games a day. The only problem is that it takes a while to get used to. If you want to get your feet to get the hang of the game, go for it.

"When it comes to wine I tend to over indulge and before I know it, I blow my diet.  What a simple and great idea to mark 4, 6 and 8 ounce servings on these wine glasses or any type of beverage such as juice, milk or soda.  The frosted lines discreetly indicate the 4, 6 and 8 ounce mark and it appears to be part of the design of the glass so it is a bit of a subtle reminder that only I would know (that I am tracking my intake of wine/beverage) if I am among a crowd of people.  This comes in a package of 2 wine glasses and they are dishwasher safe.  I really like this product and would recommend this to all my friends and family who are tracking their alcohol intake.",5.0,0

  I bought this card to be used in a Ubuntu server where I run Plex to serve my house TVs.  Installation was simple and Ubuntu/Plex worked right away without even having to install any drivers.  It just plain works.

  What I didn't like was the lack of software capabilities.  For Ubuntu there are a couple application you can get like ""Me-Tv"" or ""Kaffine"", or for me ""Plex"".  For Windows users there is less freeware to choose from, instead after buying this card you would have to go to the Hauppauge webpage and spend an additional $10 for the WinTV software.  I feel this software really should come with the card.  Also note:  In some of the screenshots and details that advertise this card it says you can watch multiple shows at the same time (showing four windows).  The only ways to watch multiple shows is with their WinTv software, no other software will let you do this (not even Plex).  Finally, if you using this for Plex note: only the primary plex account can access the program guide to watch TV, none of the other users you've created can access them.",4.0,0

It chops nuts and veggies for easy cooking prep.

I make batter and dough in it effortlessly several times a week. We eat Paleo/gluten free, so I make most all muffins, cookies, cakes & breads from scratch. We even make homemade Lara bars in seconds!

The preprogrammed buttons apply to most everything you would want to do.

A Spatula can scrape out under the blades and get out every last bit (unlike Vitamix)

It fits under my kitchen cabinet (unlike Vitamix)

The blades are not sharp so no worry about you or your kids getting cut and they never dull (unlike Vitamix)

8 year warranty and from what the rep (at Costco) said it's an easy process if needed

The best part may be the clean up. A cup or 2 of water and a few drops and let it rip. The cup is all one piece, so you don't have to take it apart to wash and then put it all back together again.

The only thing that could have improved is the sound, but I would have preferred a better sound stage.  This TV is a bit bigger than I would have liked, but it is not as big as I wanted it to be.  I would have preferred to have a wall mounted speakers.  I would have preferred a sound stage that could be the best looking in the room.

"Mounted this on the back of my 32 foot camper. Used their 50 foot extension cable and mounted the transmitter on the front of the camper. It takes a couple of seconds for the GPS to switch to the backup camera, but after my 3 and 1/2 week vacation that we just got back from, and about 3000 miles, this thing saved my butt several times.  It allowed me to turn my rig around in places I would not dare to do with out this camera, as it was to dangerous for the rig and anyone to go out to guide me back. The camera is a fish eye, so mounted at a 45 degree angle, I can see the whole back of my camper, and up into the sky, and several car widths to both sides of the back of my camper.  I was also amazed at how you can adjust the guide lines to fit your rig, raise them up, down, and spread them apart or closer together so they perfectly fit your use.  If want, you can remove the guide lines with a simple checkmark in my GPS, but with being able to adjust them so much, I would not know why anyone would want to turn them off.

"This lens is such a huge improvement over the standard kit lens. When I first acquired my Pentax Kr, I was very happy with the camera as I got back in to photography after being away for 15 years. The Kr is my first digital SLR and I felt that I could achieve great quality pictures without film with a reasonably priced kit. After 18 months, however, I was finding that there was still a quality to my images, particularly of people, that was lacking. At first, I thought it might be the camera. Then, on recommendations from other Pentax users, I decided to give this lens a try. Immediately, my images are sharper, and more colorful than with the standard kit lens. In addition, the larger aperture makes shooting in low light very easy and the bokeh is out of this world. I am very happy with this upgrade. I only wish that Pentax would have made the kit lens a bit better so it would be more useable.",5.0,0

"Most of the reviews I've read here below 2 stars are failing to treat this blender with care. If you are making smoothies, make sure you do the following:

1) Always put liquid like nectar into the cup FIRST - very important. It should be at least 1/3 of the contents.
2) Don't stick large pieces of fruit into the container. Cut them up into 1"" or less cubes. This will make it easier to blend.
3) Do not put large ice cubes in the container. It will get stuck between the container and the blades. The blades are not big. If you push your luck too far and hit the blender button, the ice cubes will get stuck. You can burn out the motor that way, let alone break the container.
4) Do not fill the container more than 75% of the contents. That will prevent any explosion and leaking.
5) Do not press the button for long durations. Do quick presses to let the contents move around and displace itself. If you get ice cubes stuck and continue to press, you will burn out the motor.
6) Always lock the cup into the base. It is really easy to just shove it in the base and hit the button. Don't. There are icons on the cup that align with the base. Use them to avoid problems.
7) Watch the contents in the cup. If they are stuck and not moving, stop pressing the button. Take those items out and cut them into smaller sizes.
8) You will know you are pushing your luck too far when you start to smell an odor coming from the unit. Stop blending and let the motor cool down.

I've made many smoothies this way and they turn out pretty good. But just don't expect professional quality because the blades and motor are nowhere near a professional/commercial quality blender.",4.0,0

"First off, you need to realize this has the Coleman name on it and that's it. It has none of the Coleman quality of the 1970's or even 80's.

It's made of thin plastic and doesn't feel very solid. It seems to work okay, I just got it and tried it out. If you are thinking this is anywhere near as bright as a Coleman gas lantern, it isn't even close. In a dark kitchen (at night, lights off) it lights up the room, but if you say wanted to read a book comfortably, you would need to be within at least 2 feet of direct level light from this thing. After 3 feet or so bright illumination degrades quickly.

The dimmer switch works but feels as if you need to be gentle with it. I woulnd't really recommend this for any real camping due to its construction.

On the plus side, it claims a long battery life and the carry handle works well. The light is not blinding when you look directly at the unit, so that is nice for in the house. Provides decent lighting in a home environment if the power were to be out of an extended period.

Also, the one I got was a bit scratched up and had some weird dust? in spots on it. They wiped off, but perhaps someone used it already? Who knows, maybe just poor quality control. I ordered through Amazon fulfillment.

I bought this in case the power goes out at home, so for that purpose it should be okay. However, if had known it was just a Coleman label on there and none of the quality (clearly made by the same company that makes all other cheap lanterns and badged as Coleman) I would have saved a bunch of money and just purchased a no-name look-a-like with similar results I'm sure.",2.0,0

"I have owned this camera for 4 years now.

Pros - Beautiful landscapes.
  Amazing outdoor shots and colors
  Easy to carry. Good response time. Good video too.
I have made a few trips, shot photos/videos at a couple of marriages and the comments on my landscape shots have generally been 'which camera do you have? Wooh that's costly for a non-SLR camera but the landscape shots are surely good.'

Cons- Indoor shots suck big time, flash power is too weak. I used a extra flash which had multiple levels but the light level indoors would either come too bright or weak and it would be just right only a few times.

I had bought it for around 600+ dollars(including the cost of accessories) when it had come out and was impressed by its build quality. It really looks cool and compact. But it turns out the prices of compactness is paid in the life of the camera. Since the lens retracts back and out it has a good chance of getting damaged. It looks like some sensors(battery/door/lens sensors) have got damaged.

That moving part stopped working a few weeks back. It does not start up and the repair cost will be at least half the cost of a good new camera. I have film cameras bought buy my dad's uncle at a yard sale in the 1950s that still work fine. I was expecting this camera to last me for at least 10 years. I am very disappointed that it has become unusable in 4 years.

I would have loved to give this camera at least 4 stars but wanted to give it only 1 for not being durable. Finally I am giving it 2 for at least good 4 years of service. They don't make them like they used to anymore. Will be trying a Nikon next.",2.0,0

"I really wanted to love these IEMs, but I can't.

I was immediately impressed by the packaging. These buds came in the neatest, most functional little white box, kind of like the EarPod cases that double as carrying cases. But the EQ on these are awful. They're marketed as bass-heavy IEMs but that makes everything you listen to on these sound muddy. Hi-Hats are hissy and piercing, and the strange emphasis on cymbal crashes and bass make all your music and lyrics sound painfully misperformed, like every instrument and lyric is acCENTed on the wrong sylLABle. Comply tips had no effect on reducing the hissy sibilance. These IEMs don't have a microphone either, which in my eyes detracts from the value of them.

I did like that these IEMS were small enough to comfortably fit in my tiny ears, unlike most bass-heavy IEMs out there. I liked the form factor and the sleek plug and cables as well, but these two things alone didn't make this pair a keeper for me. I ended up returning them.",4.0,0

"I cannot say enough to warn you away from this pillow - please save your money.

My husband bought this pillow hoping it would be as stellar as its description and it falls short in every way. After 2 months of trying to make it work (because it was SO expensive), he gave up and returned to his old pillow. I then took up the cause (because it was SO expensive) and tried to make it work.
  - There is not a slant from either side that is comfortable for your neck
  - The material collapses with the weight of your head
  - No benefit to snoring
  - Not comfortable if you sleep on your back (my husband)
  - Not comfortable if you sleep on your side (me)
So after months of trying to literally make this work, I emailed about getting a return because MOST other expensive pillow companies have 1 or 5 year guarantees....not this place. They give you so many days to return it. My mistake to trust people because they are nurses. Why would nurses sell pillows?

"I've had nothing but trouble with this GPS since I replaced a Garmin unit that died shortly after it's 1 year birthday (conveniently just out of warranty).
The unit takes a long, long time to acquire a satellite signal; prior to trying to find a satellite it takes a long time to actually boot; the units touchscreen requires a hammer-like touch to register; the unit frequently takes us on unnecessary and inexplicable diversions - for example when travelling from A to B on a straight road with no discernible traffic, it will direct us to turn right for a mile, then left, left again, and back onto the straight road we were on in the first place (perhaps it is sponsored by an Oil company?)  One lesser gripe is the unit's inability to figure out that ""DR"" in an address means ""Drive"" and not ""Doctor"".  There are lots of annoying issues with this unit that make it marginally usable, and of course I waited way too long to ever address any of these issues with the manufacturer as I should have done - so much so that I just realized we're beyond the 1 year warranty again.

It's a little difficult to get the gun to shoot the gun if you want to. It's not as loud as I was expecting it to be, but it's not as loud as I expected.

I don't really like the mounting hardware, so I'll leave that up to the seller. It's not a bad product, but it's not a very good one. I'll update this review when I find a better one.I bought this bag because I was very happy with the size and comfort of my new bike.  I was worried that this bag would be a little big, but it's a small bag that is very comfortable and compact.  I love that the handlebars are adjustable, but they are not a huge deal.

"Keyboard cover review

I bought this in grey to protect the keys of my 2017 MBA. Not from liquid spills; this would only offer protection from light splashes, not a full spill. But from dust and crumbs.

The fit is really good, it lines up perfectly. It doesnt touch or damage the screen when the laptop is closed. Typing is harder, you have to press the keys harder and its a matte, somewhat tacky finish on the keyboard cover. This means traveling around the keyboard takes some getting used to. My only gripe is that the MacBook keyboard backlighting is seriously encumbered by this cover. The cover is not transparent where the characters on each key are labeled, meaning the light doesnt shine through. The only light you get is around each key. In a dim or dark area, its no good for seeing the keys.

I like having the cover. I like how super thin it is and the protection it offers. Typing with any keyboard cover requires some getting used to. I really wish the letters and number on each key were illuminated, thats my only complaint.",5.0,0

"To be honest when I ordered this I didn't have high hopes for it but I figured it was cheap enough and would be fine for listening to music while in the shower.

It comes with a few things to mount it whichever way works for you but I've only used the ring thingy on top to hang it on the shower hook and the suction cup a couple times. Now, the suction cup..I might be missing something but to me it doesn't seem to work very well at all and I don't feel comfortable leaving it suctioned on over water because it'll probably fall in and I don't want to test to see how waterproof it really is. It's really easy to connect it to your Bluetooth and it's way louder than I expected (SCORE!!!) The only other con I've found is that sometimes when I'm using it it'll randomly connect with my husband's Bluetooth and go silent. I'm actually not sure it's connecting with his Bluetooth or just interfering but either way it's annoying to have to keep reconnecting it.

"This bicycle light mounted relatively easily to the handle bars of  my 20"" folding bike, but you do have to unscrew it totally to get it on.  The on/off button is easy to reach when riding.

The Acer Aspire I bought has 2gb ram and overall is quite fast enough for my uses and with all my Microsoft Office products.  The wireless works very good and I love the unit. I am an usually an Apple guy and really wanted a Mac Air but being that I had to buy an out drive to load software and watch DVDs plus tax I was looking at $1300 +/- a few dollars.  I decided that since I only really use this for traveling this would be a better deal and that it was.  The big negative on this unit however is the touch pad which is terrible and almost unusable to me and I have to use a mouse to really do anything or else you go crazy wasting time trying to point and click to the areas you want.  The pad just is not sensitive enough even after I adjusted as much as possible.  With the mouse it works great and it's really no big deal at least in the way I use it but if I had to continually use this with just the pad I would dump it for something else in a minute.

"Its a good stand for infrequent repair work. Arrived early and assembled in about 10 minutes. Looks sharp and professional and the color is a nice touch and it feels very sturdy.

However I did experience some things that I did take a star from.
1. The bolt that supports the clamp came slightly bent. Trying to figure out if its worth taking and putting it in my vise to bend back or call park tool and do the return dance. Its not a severe bend, but when under load it is clearly visible but not sagging too much

2. The clamp rotating mechanism on mine tends to stick. I am chalking this up to needing some lubrication in the top to allow some more movement.

3. The legs do not fold up into a contraption that allows them to stay. The kind of flop around. A nite-ize might solve this and clean this up, but how hard would it be to include a plastic piece to put on the stand to keep the legs together?

I honestly expected a bit more from Park Tool. If the bolt is bent from a default then I get that, but I bought this stand and spent more money since I didn't want what looked like Chinese knockoffs and the quality that I know and come to love with Park Tool. This is a great stand to use when I am cleaning my bike after a ride or doing some adjusting, but I would be weary to doing some hard core wrenching on this due to the clamp. I am just getting into MTBing so this will suit me fine, but serious and seasoned riders might want to look to a PCS-10 or another step up stand. This one will be fine for now for novice guys wanting to tinker on their bike and don't mind some of the shortcomings.",4.0,0

These are great and work with the Neato D80. I contemplated getting a generic brand but after thinking it through and ordering and comparing the Neato replacement filter with this brand I decided to go with the brand. I found that the material used to make the pleats of the filter were of higher quality than the original filter however a note to this is that filters on these units will get irreversibly clogged up with dirt and you will be better off replacing the filter after about 20-30 cleanings depending on the composition of dirt on the floors. That said the filters are consumable items and being able to purchase these filters at a lower (approx. 1/2) price meant that I could have more of them. The extra side brushes are also a needed item because like a little pet there is no telling where the side brush may come off the unit.,5.0,0

"My plans for this card included testing it using an ExpressCard 34 card reader installed in my older MacBook Pro and using it for the DVR function in a stand-alone surveillance camera. Well, the laptop died and the surveillance cam uses a micro-SD card.

I decided to try something completely different. I bought a Sony MRW-F3 card reader, which is specifically compatible with SD HC and SD XC cards. I then plugged the reader and card into my desktop Mac. Using Disk Utility, I reformatted the card as a bootable Mac OSX drive. I then installed Mac OSX 10.6 (Snow Leopard) on the card and ran Software Update until the installation was current (10.6.8). The desktop machine was booting from the card after the initial install. I copied some diagnostic software from my hard drive and did any setup needed for that software.

What I ended up with is a bootable external drive with diagnostic software. It is recognized as a startup volume by both the Startup Disk system preference and choose boot volume (option key) at startup. The computer boots quickly from the SD card and I did not find any issues running it from the card. The installation of the OS and diagnostic software uses a little more than half of the 16GB capacity. Unfortunately, this did not help my defunct laptop, which does not recognize any kind of drive, internal or external. On the other hand, I now have a quick, easy method of running maintenance routines and diagnostics on the boot drives of my two desktop Macs and any other Mac that can boot into OS 10.6.

This is not how this card is typically used, but I wanted a challenging situation for the card and turning it into a boot drive seemed to fit the bill. The card is fast and reliable in this unconventional application.",5.0,0

"It is all plastic - pretty sure the mirror is to.
Functionally it is not bad.
It does have a very clear view if it is plastic, better than many.
I'd rated higher but - 1 the handle bar mounting bracket is a rigid plastic - typically these don't last very long exposed to the sun. They get brittle and break easily. 2 - there is no way to lock the mirror in position so bumps (or branches) cause the mirror to move. The main arm can be tightened into position with the main mounting screw which helps. The arm is a thicker rigid plastic and should hold up pretty well to street usage.
Will have to be careful with this off road or if you tend to lay (kids drop) your bike as it will break. My arm actually twisted when it fell over, it did not break.
The mounting bracket will only fit on the thinner portion of the handle bar - look closely at the listing photos to see what I am referring to.
If you don't have this area available it won't fit. I was going to mount it on my handlebar bar ends but it is to small for them. It will only fit right next to the shifter which had to be adjusted a little to let it fit on the bar around the shifter and its cable.

"Die Dog Hair....Die!!!!
Around Christmas time we were expecting guests... I pulled out my vacuum and nothing. Sometime in the last few months of neglect it had expired. RIP... I still had guests coming. I live in the middle of national forest. Think, Big trees, bears, dirt, dirt and more dirt. Naturally I didn't have the time to drive the 140+ miles round trip to go to a town that has a stop light and a walmart. So what did I do I went to our local (only 30 miles away) hardware store. They carry two vacuums, not a lot of choice, but apparently there is a reason they only carry two. They work!  The Eureka was the more expensive of the two by about $20.00 But I liked the rewinding cord feature so I got it and went along home. Put it together and started vacuuming the cabin, let me tell you, it was amazing. Carpet that I had been thinking of replacing took on new life, the attachments were easy to use. Of all the silly things I was having FUN vacuuming. No really, it's true. BUT THE BEST PART was how it handled the dog hair in my home. I have two large golden retrievers, They are serious about their shedding. I truly believe that they think it's a career opportunity. They take it that seriously. This thing sucked it up along the base boards, under the beds off of the log walls and out of the couch cushions and not once did it clog up. I wish it had another attachment extension but other than that it's a well designed machine. My only other suggestion for improvement would be to come out with a ride-um-model with a cup holder.",5.0,0

"The charger works well.  No overheating or other issues.  However, I have only charged at 200 mAh.  No rush.  No need to charge at a higher rate.

The two pairs of AA batteries that came with the unit have each lasted 19-21 days of pretty consistent usage in my Mac's Magic Mouse.  Alkalines last about a week longer than this.  Using a price of $.50 each for AA alkaline batteries (I know; there are lower prices.  There are also much higher.)  and my purchase price for the charger with four each AA and AAA batteries, the payback period is 3.5 years based solely on Mac Magic Mouse usage.

Note: A fresh charge of the Lacrosse AA's results in 1.44 - 1.46 volts though they are only rated at 1.2 volts.  Alkalines are generally rated at 1.5 volts.  Apple's Mouse Battery Level indicator under System Preferences is based on 1.5-volt batteries.  Therefore, fresh rechargeables do not show as a 100% charge in the Mac's Mouse Battery Level.

It was interesting to watch the mouse batteries' discharge rate as shown by the Mac System Preferences.  About 30% of the charge was lost during the first two days.  Days 3 - 17 saw a discharge of 22%--averaging -1.6%/ day.  The last 2-3 days saw a discharge of about 37% at which point they had to be replaced.

I ran one pair of the new Lacrosse AA's through the Refresh Process to compare to the other new pair run thru the Test Process (i.e., fully charge-discharge-fully charge again).  One battery took eight days to complete, the other took ten.  The improvement for the Refresh Process on these new batteries vs. Test Process was negligible, less than 100 mAh.  Refresh might be worthwhile on old, neglected batteries, however.

I received the scale and it came with 2 plastic case type things that was neatly packaged with it. They protect as well as can be used to put on the scale and weight items in them as well. The scale plate is stainless steel. The scale has 4 buttons to operate and a LCD screen display with a blue back light which makes it nice and easy to read your results.  It has many functions.. such as power, tar, mode and pcs. Thankfully I had my son here and he helped go through some of it with me faster. It is pretty easy to use once you begin to use. You can weigh 0.1 gram to 2000 grams.. It has different units depending on different countries :g/oz/ozt/dwt/ct/gn,  you can choose your frequently-used unit. Another great thing is it has a 60 sec Auto Shut off, which is great if you forget to shut it off your not wasting your batteries.

I have really liked this scale so far, You will need 2AAA batteries to begin using it. This has been very handy around the house.. There is so many things you can use this for.. and I'm happy to finally have one of my own.

"I almost gave it only 3 stars.
But, I decided that because it did the job I had hoped it would, I would give it 4 stars.
I would have given it 5 stars, except that after a couple of weeks, the foam padding on the kneeling board is showing signs of breaking down.
It will not last much longer.
I'll have to figure out a way to replace the padding with a good memory foam.
Then, it'll be a good kneeling chair.

With that said, I love the chair, or what ever you want to call it.
I've had it for about 3 weeks now.
My lower back, leg and foot problems are dissipating nicely.
I was worried that I might be turning diabetic.
A checkup confirmed that I wasn't.
The problems were most likely being caused by LONG HOURS sitting in front of a monitor.

It took a couple of weeks for my knees to begin getting used to it.
But, they're adapting nicely. Which is a good sign for anyone else because I'm in my 70's.

"I have an Android phone (HTC Evo 3D) and tablet (Nexus 7). The headset works near perfectly on my phone. My issue is that I found that the headset won't work the Netflix app, and I suspect there will be other apps as well that aren't compatible.  For example, all the controls work great with Pandora, Stitcher and YouTube, but the pause/play doesn't work with Netflix. Oddly, the headset doesn't work as seamlessly with the Nexus 7. I'm sitting right next to the tablet and the sound sporadically cuts in and out.

Now on to the good things.  The sound is pretty good, so far nobody has pointed out to me that I must be on a Bluetooth! That is awesome, usually the person on the other end can tell that you're wireless.  The distance is good as well. I like that I can walk 20 feet away and it's still connected. I plan on trying a further distance soon.  I also like the volume level. I'm glad that it can go very loud if needed.  The battery life is pretty decent.  I had to charge it after a day and a half of heavy usage. I also noticed that after my second day or wearing it, I often forget it's there. It's not heavy and you get used to it being there really fast.

Other than the few issue I pointed out, I have no other complaints. It works well with my phone and that's most important to me.  It's a good headset at a good price.

"Another brain-damaged design by Sony - a well-built, almost completely perfect device crippled to the point of being worthless by a small oversight.

This device starts tracks at the beginning after it powers off and you turn it back on.  This makes it a definite no-go for most people as it can't be used for long files such as audio books.

I contacted SonyStyle support before buying because the specs didn't indicate that it would resume tracks at the current point, and I wanted to know for sure before I bought it.  I have had a history of items from Sony that are like that - designed and tested by engineers, but completely untouched by non-techie consumers.  SonyStyle support assured me that it would resume tracks at the current point when powered off.  After buying and receiving the item, I couldn't find anything in the instructions about how to resume at current point, so I called SonyStyle again.  After 45 minutes of insisting that it would do it and attempting to do it on his, the tech finally admitted that it wouldn't.  It would only restart the current track.  He also couldn't give an ETA on a firmware update that would allow this.  So, (thanks Amazon), I sent it back. No more Sony for me.

It may be fixed at some point in the future by a firmware update, but caveat emptor.

For those that care, the players I found that do allow resume AND have PlaysForSure (no iPods here):

Creative Zen Stone (PERFECT device, awesome in every aspect)
Sandisk Sansa (AAA battery; when it dies you lose your place)

"For once its nice to have a hot breakfast at work.

I almost never have time to make breakfast in the mornings so I usually take a granola bar or a piece of fruit. Now that I have this neat little set of Crackin' Egg cookers I can enjoy a hot meal at my desk and it takes less than thirty seconds. Its super easy to use. Just make sure to poke the yolk with a fork so it doesn't explode in the container. I also found that if you spray the container with a little non-stick cooking spray that the egg comes out cleaner.

The only gripe I have with these microwave egg cookers is that I haven't been able to make an egg that isn't over hard. I've tried cooking it at thirty seconds instead of the recommended thirty to fourt-five. But it still comes out over cooked. I think I'll be trying the scrambled egg recipe but other than that I still enjoy a hot and nutritious breakfast. I'm thinking this would be great for someone with kids because you could pop it in the microwave in the morning and take it with you in the car. They're very portable.

Overall I think these are a cool way to make a super fast breakfast that is nutritious as well as delicious.

"I have had this keyboard for a year. I bought it because it is light and thin.  It succeeds in both those areas. The protruding hinge doesn't really bother me although it is not elegant.  The rest of the keboard actually is kind of cool.  I like the tilting mechanism when it is open. Some complain that the ipad falls out of the keyboard slot. It does occasionally but it works pretty well in general.  Now for the negative...and it has become big enough for me that I can't recommend the device.  The ipad and keyboard, when in the closed position, does not clasp shut.  The ipad rests in the closed position on top of the keyboard.  It easily slides off, but more often, it moves just enough to turn the ipad on and wear down the battery.  At least once or twice a week, I go to use it and it is dead because it just sat on for 12 hours. You can't see that it is turned on.  It is so frustrating. I don't know why they didn't make a clasp or connector to keep the thing closed.  Normal travel is bound to jar it open just enought to turn it on. Ugh.  If you can manage keeping it closed (or completely turn off the ipad each time) the keyboard works well.  Thats it.",2.0,0
"I bought this vacuum primarily for use on my laminate floors, and it works very well. I'm very pleased with the suction, especially given the price.
The tools are... okay. Actually, I LOVE the crevice tool. However, I found the dusting tool effective only for moving cat fur around without sucking it up. The upholstery tool worked okay, but when I took the removable piece off to empty dust out, it seemed impossible to put together again without breaking the plastic parts. I managed to pop it back into place, but then it wouldn't spin. Just too much of a pain; I ended up attempting tools from a previous vac.
Oh yes, and the retractable cord does not work on my vac. That is a bummer; but overall I still like the product.",4.0,0
"I have 3 sets of these gloves... two of the prevouos model with the criss cross velcro strips and one of the newer rubber strips.
I find the older model gave better support and position of the knuckes was aided from the tightening of the strips.
Are they better than handwraps? if you use cheap practice gloves, yes. Specially if your hands get sore easily.
but beware that they don't offer very strong wrist support, unless you really tighten them.
the stiching on one of them has come undone, but note that is probably from choosing a wrong size... if they are not snug enough and move around inside the gloves that maight be the case... I have two L mand an Xl the Xl has had the stichting come undone.
Not that it matters much... these suckers are for punching.  I have recently traded my cheap Everlast practice gloves for Title's Fighting brand sparring gloves. Perhaps I will go with wraps again.

"This is a replacement for my last Cuisinart 12 cup coffee maker (which was probably 6 plus years old); it is almost identical; the only upgrade is this one comes with a little metal coffee filter; you have the option of removing this metal cone and using the paper filters.  From what I have read, I have decided to just use the paper ones as  they remove more sediment and oil.  I like a mild, bitter free coffee (so I use a Chemex whenever I have time--BEST COFFEE MAKER IN THE WORLD IN MY OPINION--but not a good unit when you are going to work or in a hurry--see my review on it).  Anyway, when time is short, this coffee maker is simple to operate, has a small clock (that you can't see very well as it is very small and inconspicuous); the machine is programmable as advertised.  The unit has a small charcoal filter that is easily accessible (it's at the end of the plastic piece that fits in the top left corner of the machine where you put the water in), and it is very easy to change (the plastic double piece just pops open and then you can remove the old filter).  The controls are pretty much the same as my old unit except there is now an off/on switch (my old one you just moved the dial to brew, and  presto it started working).  This unit (like the old one) has a 1 to 4 cup brewing option.  I guess what I am saying is if it isn't broke don't fix  it (or if you have a good product don't make a lot of changes to it--it should last well if you take care of it--like most things in life).  I think it is the best electrical unit on the market for the money.",5.0,0

It works perfectly for both uses, and neither of them has lost and strength or spring in the months that I've been using them.

I listen to all types of music, but my headphone time tends to be Jazz and vocals and the AKG's don't disappoint.  Also, if you have a large head, as I do:)  you should be careful with these.

"This purchase was a nice replacement for my older Garmin nuvi 350.  I paid about $120 on sale for this unit and paid nearly $300 for the older nuvi 350.  For starters, the free Lifetime update was very nice.  For my Garmin nuvi 350, I had to purchase the map updates card for about $95.  The screen on this unit is thinner and a little larger.  I was pleased to discover the a/c vent attached mount my daughter bought years ago still works with this Garmin.  I can't yet tell if the Traffic feature is available in my area, at least I haven't been rerouted yet.  I do like that this model tells you roughly what lane to be in for a turn or exit coming up.  I could see where that would be helpful driving in areas like California.  The feature that provides your traveling speed in the lower left is kind of annoying.  I don't know why I would use that if I have a working speedometer and it's not that accurate.  I think I can change that to display the distance to the destination. It boots up faster and does a better job of detecting the satellites. I'm very pleased with it and think it was a terrific value for the money.

I put the older Garmin nuvi 350 in the kids' car.  Utah commonly has addresses like 348 East 500 North. Addresses are indexed from the center of each town.  Once the teenagers figured out that Garmin just wants the 348 for the address and 500 for the street, which then gives you options to choose 500 North or 500 South, they use it whenever driving to someplace new.",5.0,0

"I upgraded from the S4i which, despite the ear tip choices, didn't quite fit right. While I can't justify that the high price of the X10i has anything, if any, to do with fit, they DO fit much better. Maybe it's the obtuse, minimalist design as compared to the slight rear bulge of the S4i (not that those were big in the first place). Now I'm able to hear instruments in songs I never heard before!

You'll hear EVERYTHING with these, which can be good or bad, especially if you listen to a song encoded poorly. My mp3s aren't lossless by any means, but the clarity the X10i gives is unparalleled. I was expecting to hear much more hisses and clicks, but surprisingly I haven't (lucky, i guess). It hits all the highs and lows just the way I like them!

I use these mainly while playing my e-drum kit through a Roland TD-9, so its discriminating fidelity is important to me.

If these reviews only focused on the product in-hand, then I would have posted 5 out of 5 stars. IMHO, reviews encompass all that comes with the product, from its accessories to the warranty period. I gave the X10i 4 stars for the following reasons: 1) At such a premium price, why aren't the included airplane and 1/4"" adapters gold just like the headphone's 3.5 mm jack? I don't lower my audiophilic standards on a flight or when plugging these into a stereo receiver. 2) I can't justify a 350% price increase between these and the S4i, which were a great-sounding pair of headphones (when they fit) at a much lower price point.

"I've never worn wireless earbuds before and I was a little concerned about how much they might way and just the overall comfort of them and then they arrived. These things are light and to be honest they are quite comfortable as well. I read several reviews stating that they would fall out of the persons ear so I was a little worried about that as well. I did not have that problem at all. They paired up to my phone easily and quickly and then I popped them in my ears and went to go walk down the street to get the mail. Fit fine and did not jar loose on the short walk. I then took them for a short 4.5mile run the next morning on a combination of sidewalks and dirt paths and the only time I had to readjust the earbud was when the wire that connects the two sides got pulled on by the collar of the shirt I was wearing. Other than that they stayed put and sounded great. I have not run out of battery on them and I have used them on and off for the past couple of days around the house and at the gym. The only thing I would change would actually just be adding an option for additional colors to choose from, but the bright yellow definitely makes them hard to misplace.

They sound great.

I've had no construction issues with the kettle in the 2 months we've owned it.

The one annoying design issue I had (which is more user err than anything) pertains to the location of the 'on' light.

I'd plugged the kettle in with the handle facing me and hit the on switch but saw nothing indicate it was on. I was like a monkey trying to figure out why the darn thing would turn on...then I realized the light was on the side of the kettle I could see.

If you don't have a home range that you can erect permanent target hangers and have to bring your targets with you to an open shooting area, these make perfect sense.

I hang two 12"" targets and an 8"" from it and it's rock solid.

"Cons:
Biggest con: cables sometimes not long enough. Also, it REQUIRES A DRIVER. Will not work properly without it.
I got this unit so I can run a dekstop and laptop together. A few things to note... the vga cables are short an dthe attached usb cable is short but appears to work on most pc's as long as the ports needed are open. The vga cable being short meant that I had to purchase a vga extension cable.
As mentioned switching isn't instantaneous etc.
5 second delay to get the mouse recognized.
Also I may be wrong but the usb appeared to be needed to be plugged in for the switch to work or detect.
At the beginning I also encountered trouble with installing the driver.
The windows 7 machine works flawlessly. The xp machine appears to not detect that the belkin is connected. However it still outputs a signal and works. I just can't use software switching. Only the hardware using the button.
Also the monitor plugs are tough to connect but work fine.

Biggest pro:
The big simple switch. I wish it was longer to reach me but the switch is very useful. Just tapping it with my foot does the job. I haven't tried out the audio so I can't comment on how well it works. I also haven't tried connecting usb 2 devices to it.

"A quick explanation of the title. I have severe to profound loss of hearing in the mid to high frequency range and my Sharp LC60LE835U become just about unintelligible with its poor speakers (wonderful picture). Was looking to go CC but, after reading the reports of soundbars, decided to try one last thing. Had a 5:1 Bose system whose speaker system couldn't easily be connected after moving into a new home. It came down to the Sony CT-150 and the Yamaha ATS 1010 (from Costco). The decision was made after reading that I could use my powered sub-woofer with the Yamaha, plus its great glossy black looks matched the TV, blueray (& Cisco VCR .. to some extent).
Real simple optical connection from TV, and wow! ... I could now hear with clarity, from movies to TV series. I replayed a couple of TV shows & movies that I had previously had real difficult time in understanding, and now had a whole different audio experience. A boon for baby boomers for sure.
Now for the short list of cons, not deal breakers but folks should be aware of them. The built-in sub-woofer is simply not up to the job - get an external unit to really appreciate the bass (especially in movies).  The surround sound is not wondrous, and to advertise it as a 7:1 experience is just plain deceptive. Yamaha should get real with its claims about this aspect. However, I would imagine this unit is just about there with others in this class and no-one in their right minds can really expect a decent surround sound from a soundbar.
To conclude, the Yamaha far exceeded my expectations in uplifting my TV experience - if you have similar hearing loss, just give this a try.",4.0,0

"This is my third foray into the world of inexpensive HD cameras.  About two years ago I bought a similar sized and priced Sony model - and I like the Sanyo much better.  The Sony used tape, which was less convenient, and the interface to my computer was terrible in comparison to the Sanyo.  The video quality for both is comparable.

At Christmas I also bought a Flip HD.  I love the convenience and the computer interface for the Flip, and because of its size I tend to use it much more than the Sanyo.  They Sanyo certainly has many more features for a little more money, so which one you would buy depends on your situation.

If you often shoot video at the last minute, and are less concerned about quality (though for its size the Flip looks great) than you are about ""capturing the moment"" - I would buy the Flip. You can literally stuff it in a shirt pocket or your glove box and it is there if you need it. Ditto if you want a really simple interface and an easy to use camera.

If you instead want to create some better home videos, and a little bigger camera with more features is appealing, then buy the Sanyo.",3.0,0

"I recently ruined the camera I was using--a Canon Powershot A3100 IS. I loved that camera and was sad when it was accidentally dropped and ruined. I was looking for a replacement and did quite a bit of research before settling on this model (Canon Powershot ELPH 110 HS). Most of the reviews for this model were very positive. I ran an online comparison between it and several other models and brands. I wanted a point & shoot because it's easier for me to use. (I have a form of rheumatoid arthritis) This camera is smaller than anything I've owned before, but I absolutely love it. One of the features that has impressed me and caught my eye on other reviews is the wide angle lens it possesses. This allows more light into each shot and the pictures I've taken so far have been impressive. They are crisp, clear, and the colors are extremely vivid. It's very similar to the Canon 3100 I owned, so figuring out how to use it has been a breeze.

If you are looking for a great point & shoot that takes clear shots with relative ease, this is the camera for you. I'm excited to try out the video feature--I haven't had a chance to use it yet, but with the grandkids coming this weekend, I'll be sure to give it a good workout.",5.0,0

"For today's standards, this is a nice, functional VCR that I would recommend to anybody who needs one.  But if you are looking for a comparable replacement for your 80s or 90s VCR, you will most likely be disappointed.

This LED display, for one thing, is lacking.  While VCRs used to show the tape counter while a tape is being played, rewinded, or fastforwarded, this VCR only displays the words ""PLAY"" or ""STOP"" or ""REW"", etc.  There is a very noticible delay when rewinding or fastforwarding, which can get very annoying at times.  The VCR also does not have any useful gimmicks, like Sony's Commercial Skip, that seperate it from any other brand or model.

My advice is this:  If you 1) already have a seperate DVD player for the same TV or 2) you do not plan to watch DVDs in the near future, then I would definitely buy this VCR model.  If not, then you should definitely look into buying a VCR/DVD combo, which in general do not have the problems mentioned above.  You can find an excellent one for just $100-150.",3.0,0

"Prior to purchasing this kettle I had used an all steel kettle on my flat glass range.  I hate this stove because I have to be so careful heating things (it heats by magnetic induction so if the pot/pan/kettle has no metal, it won't heat it very well).  I had tried this glass kettle flat on the surface but it took 30 minutes to boil water (minimal magnetic stuff in this glass).  I was concerned about it cracking, but it survived as long as I ramped the heat up slowly and didn't just crank it.  I then tried various heat diffusors (cast iron grate, some other wire zig zag thing I had) but the best one is the clover metal wire that came with the kettle.  It now takes 10-15 minutes to boil water (it took 5 minutes in my metal kettle, but then my water tasted like metal).  Even when I straight up crank the stove temp to high, the kettle has shown no signs of breakage.  My only complaint which may be my stoves fault, is that even though no glass is touching the surface, I am still developing a brown halo stain around my burner.  What am I burning?  Air?  is something coming off of the glass?  I doubt it.  But I cant blame the kettle as it is doing its job even on my crummy stove.  Also the clover diffuser burns a stain into the glass, but with enough 409 and some elbow grease, and steel wool, I can get the stains off.

I have only been using this kettle for a month and the handle has not yet loosened, like so many reviewers are complaining.  If anything changes, I will update my review.",5.0,0

These molds don't each hold the same shape.  They are fairly thin and do distort easily. They are a bit of work to clean.

So far I've tried networked with the internet and it works fine. The only downside is that it's very small. I bought the TRS-80A as a replacement for my older model. I'm very pleased. I bought this to replace a broken one I bought for my TV. I wanted something that had a built-in DVD player and could use a USB hub. I chose the TRS-80A because it's very portable.

I can also use the remote to turn the TV on and off with my Roku. It's not the best for long distance but I'm sure it will last a long time. I would highly recommend this product.

"This is exactly what I wanted.  I was looking for a bedspread that would be long enough to hide the metal bed rails--the bed has a headboard but no side rails or foot board.  I've been using a dust ruffle for years and, honestly, the tucking of all of the blankets, making sure the dust ruffle doesn't get caught up in the tucking, was very aggravating.  Especially since my toddler grandson naps in this bed at least twice a week.  I wanted a simpler way to make the bed after nap without having to tuck all of the blankets in.  The bed is queen size and after measuring, I determined that a queen size spread would not work--they are typically sized for use with dust ruffles or on beds with side rails and foot board.  I ordered a king size spread and turned it so the long edge runs across the width of the bed instead of the length of it.  Because there is no pattern that would dictate it be used the way it was intended, this works just great.  The spread is top quality.  After making sure it was the right fit, I washed it and put it on the bed.  It's just perfect and washed beautifully.  No odd smell, no excessive lint, no missed stitching.  This purchase also had the option of buying standard size pillow shams (king spread with standard OR king shams), which I did.  My toddler's bed looks great and will be easy to make as he gets in and out of it. I am going to check to see if it comes in other colors so I can order another one for change of seasons.

"What you see in the picture is what you get. Plus a case and a lanyard. They are about 8 inches long and have a braid/line cutter. My only complaint is that they don't spring back firmly when you close them and reduce your pressure on the handles. And for that reason, they feel almost as if they are worn out. The actual construction of the pliers themselves are solid, there is little or no give or wiggle to them. It's just that you expect them to spring back more firmly, but they don't. It's like using a pliers without a spring and you have to hook your pinky over the bottom handle to help you open and close them. You shouldn't have to feel like this is necessary with a good pair of pliers that are spring loaded.

"I've been using the Frigidaire Professional Programmable Water Kettle several times a day and I have not once been disappointed! This kettle has several improvements over my previous electric kettle. First, the water tank holds 1. 7 liters so I do not need to continually fill the kettle. When I fill the kettle with filtered water in the morning, it lasts all day and into the evening without refilling. My previous kettle would only make three cups of tea before refilling and this kettle makes 7 cups of tea. Second, the water temperature is controlled with a digital display. The temperature is measured in Fahrenheit on the top of the kettle. The settings include 175F (green tea), 185F (white tea), 195F (oolong tea), 200F (french press coffee), 212F (black tea). When I played with different settings and the same tea flavor, I would get different results. Temperature matters! The kettle automatically remembers the last setting and all I need to do is push start/stop to create a new pot of water. Finally, the kettle has a ""wow"" factor with multi-color lights! As the water heats up, the handle changes color from green to blue to purple to red to orange, indicating the temperature of the water. My kids and husband thought it was ""cool"" to watch the light show. I did observe condensation in the handle once the kettle cools down. This kettle is a huge improvement over my previous kettle (utiliTEA Variable Temperature Electric Kettle). My previous model had a temperature control knob that you turn right or left. and I never really knew how to get the temperature correct! Now when someone in my family adjusts the temperature of the water on this kettle, I will see the numeric temperature before pouring water over my tea leaves. If you like tea then you'll like this kettle! I'm very fussy over my tea as well as my kettle. UPDATE 2016: Three years later and it still works great! Everyone in my family uses this kettle and it's been reliable and efficient.",5.0,0

I received a pair of goggles at a discounted price for this review but the opinion expressed is all mine. The quality of these goggle is very good. The come with changeable nose pieces so you can find your perfect fit. The hold is very tight so they will not leak. You don't have to press very hard for them to suction on. The strap is easily adjusted so you don't have to fight with it. It has a wide range of sizes so it should fit most perfectly. A huge plus is they come with UV protection because keeping your eyes protected is very important. The storage case has drainage vents at the bottom so you can just place them in the protective case after use. I would purchase these goggles again.,5.0,0

The audio is good. The programming through the front panel (keypad) is easier than a Uv-5R. It has better audio than a Baofeng. It has better output than a Baoefeng (~1w more). The feel of the radio is great for the price range. the cross band repeat is a nice feature. The display is good, easy to read.

Now the bad...

-Chrip, not there yet. It actually corrupts several of the channel settings when I push this to the radio. This may change in the future, but with the latest (as of Dec. 1 2014) daily release...not there yet.
- The Wouxen software, not good. Its better than the Baofeng software, but I still find it challenging to move memory slots around.

Also, I want to include in memory several law enforcement frequencies, WX and PUD frequencies, but there is no way that I can see to disable TX? Whats up with that? On other radios, I can add frequencies to my channel memories, but I can disable TX for those. On the KG-U8D I see no way to do this. So I only hope that my kids don't get a hold of the radio and key down on those channels. I can disable TX on any other radio I own including the cheap UV-5R's; So I was really disappointed to see this.

"I'm a survivalist and outdoorsman and love to fish so this fishing vest is right up my alley. I cannot begin to tell you how much room for storage and equipment this gives you. It is amazingly adjustable and is more than comfortable for me(6'3"" 270 lbs) with room to expand, yet if I were 5'10"" and 170 lbs it would be just as comfortable because it literally is made for anyone of any size. That's the kind of stuff I love. Let me give you an idea of how much this can fit. I am able to take along with me in this vest a survival kit including emergency blanket, water purification tablets, two compasses, 50 feet of paracord, mid sized walkie talkie, fire starting materials, set of keys, wallet and spare hooks, line, sinkers and lures.

It doesn't weigh you down, you have multiple pockets, Velcro straps and areas to clip onto. This material is rip stop and tear proof, and incredibly breathable! Comfortable as can be and it looks great. I have seen some vests that look deplorable, this one is incredibly fashionable as is it practical. What I love most is that I don't have to carry an additional bag or rucksack when fishing any longer as this is more than capable of carrying everything I need. With a dry bag in tow I have everything covered. I was provided this item discounted in exchange for a thorough review. The seller asked for honesty even if it was non favorable. That shows integrity and you can be sure you are buying from a reputable and honest seller.

"I did not buy this for hanging deer. I built a 9'x8' shelf in my garage and established it at about 4.5 feet so a car's nose could go under it, but there would still be sufficient room to store meaningful items on top of it (like snow blowers, lawn mowers, generators, etc...). The problem is getting the seasonal equipment onto the shelf. Most of it is pretty darn heavy. I initially looked into some block & tackle systems but was shocked at the prices for what I considered very modest quality. I finally settled on this as a lift system. I was about a third the cost of the cheapest block & tackle and better quality. I use the hangar part that you affix the deer legs to as the lifting hook and bolted the rest to the ceiling just a few inches out from the shelf. Using this system, I can lift by myself a 150 pound snowthrower 4.5 feet into the air and onto the shelf I made for the season once spring arrives. Bicycles, lawn mowers, BBQ, etc... works great and much more economical than the pulley systems being sold today.",5.0,0
"This is really a beautiful set of high quality knives that I anticipate lasting a long time.  The come from the factory razor sharp and over the limited time I have used them have show no signs of wear.  The set features a nice variety of knives from a small paring knife all the way up to a good size butcher's knife.  All feature excellent balance and enough weight to feel serious and comfortable without being clumsy.  Moreover, the handles are nicely positioned relative to the blade, which makes chopping both easier and safer.  I will say that in particular I liked the serrated carving knife, something you don't typically see in this size set.  I happened to be cooking a roast the day the knives arrived, and the carving knife made short, clean work of it.

It would be nice if there was an option to receive a block instead of a magnet rack; I'm not opposed to the latter, but I don't happen to have a convenient place to hang it which is going to make storing these knives a small, but worthwhile challenge.

I ordered it on the 10th and it was delivered on the 17th, so that's pretty good free shipping in my opinion.

It did have a slight chemical factory smell, but I've been letting it air out in the living room with all of the windows opened and that's helped already. My only complaint is that the different positions of the recliner don't really click into place. Like, you can hear the click when it's in position, but when I lean back on it, it just goes to the farthest back setting, so it's not really adjustable unless you have it pushed back against a wall to hold it in place.

for now ill just give it 1 star because i think i received a defective product. when i use the app on my HTC One M8 it seems slugish loading pictures or even video files. i have yet to try transfer files between the devices. when i finally managed to get a video file to play i actually watched a video for an hour. after that i the mobilelite on but was not using my phone with it 3 hours later its already blinking a red light and i charged the thing for more than 8 hours. this is definitely not what is advertised on amazon i believe it's supposed to last 13 hours streaming videos or listening to music and viewing photos on multiple devices... so i am definitely planning on returning this thing. i ordered 2 of them 1 for myself and for my father. not sure how my fathers device held up so far maybe he had better luck than me. i might try this device again but then again i might switch to the Sandisk Connect Wireless or the RAVPower FileHub. i like kingston products but this device let me down really hoping that it's just a defective product.,1.0,0

The instructions are easy to follow and it took me 20 minutes to put in and tighten the screws.  I find it has good back support and the adjustable arms fit nicely with my computer desk.  The chair swivels easily and is adjustable in height.

"This review is for the charger purchased for a Samsung Galaxy S6. I am very very happy with this purchase, and cannot believe I didn't have this cable before! Like most people, I was using the charger that came with my phone which had frayed beyond belief in the 8 or 9 months that I have had it. Not sure why Samsung doesn't make more durable cables, but I guess they bank on the fact that you'll need to buy a new charger every year or so. But I digress. So my current charger was basically frayed in the section right where it connects to the phone part, so there was a 'particular' way you had to lay the phone for it to properly charge. This left many situations where the phone was plugged in all night, but it wasn't actually charging because the cable wasn't lying in the right position. Annoying, right?
So I was browsing Amazon in it's splendid glory late one night, as I've come to do recently, and decided to order this. Was pleasantly suprised! These are some durable cables! They don't seem flimsy, even at the USB and plug-in part. And the cable is loooooong. How was I tethered to the short, 1 ft charger all this time?
I really feel like I've been living under a rock, because this seems to solve all the problems of the original charger all at once!
 I like that there's a three-pack because, let's be real, my husbands charger is in no better state. And most importantly, because I'm sure this is an issue for many people, it doesn't seem to take longer to charge the phone. Now I haven't done an actual timing of it, but it seemed to take the same amount of time for me. And again, if the cable is in good shape and not finicky, there's less chance that it's just plugged in and not actually charging. I am very happy and will re-purchase these if they ever get destroyed. although whatever would destroy these would likely take the phone with it.",5.0,0

"I finally bought this after year-before-last's annual ""fight with the bird"", and am very happy I did.  This is large enough for all but my mother's ""monster"" birds - but she has a rimmed cutting counter my dad built for her so that doesn't count, right? The well is wonderful, big enough to hold the drips from even a large well rested turkey - this has been a major problem with other boards we had, the side drains and wells were ineffective at best in keeping the mess on the board and not all over the counter, but this one works, no mess!  At least not on the counter.  It is pretty enough that I have used it as a serving tray three times so far, for a holiday beef roast, a ham, and two roast chickens, all looked lovely. and I didn't have to worry about drips damaging my table.  It is a nice tight grain, and washes easily - I applied cutting board oil twice prior to using and after each use and wash - no staining or cracking so far and I've had it just over a year.  It looks like it will last a long time.  Very happy so far, will report back if that changes but looks like a great purchase so far.",5.0,0

"I bought this chain because I was having some minor but persistent shifting problems with the other new chain that I had just installed. I noted that other reviewers had said that it improved their shifting, so I thought that it might help, and it seems to have done the trick. No mis-shifts or stuttering since I put this on after about 30 miles of test driving where I did up and down shifting frequently.
 A couple of notes. One is that the missing link was in a small package at the bottom of the small box that the chain came in, and it is very easy to miss if you are not careful. Two, is that this requires a different size missing link than some other KMC chains for 6/7/8 speed bikes. As others have noted it is 7.3 mm vs 7.1 , a tiny difference but trust me, you can't get a 7.1 missing link to work (I tried by accident).",5.0,0

"I was pleasantly surprised. I used this film to build my own solar filter with cardboard and it's awesome.

But, when I finally got my filter built, and slipped over the scope, I was a little shocked. the sun spots were so vivid, and the sun's surface is clearly quite turbulent. I also really like the coloration. I've seen photos taken with the Baeder film (which produces a white image) wherein the photographers used software to add some yellow color to their images. in the end, their images looked just like what you see through this black polymer.

"When I saw how comfortable the model in the picture looked, I knew I had to have one. This pillow is of very high quality, is a good compromise between soft and firm (right in the middle), and is exactly as pictured.

Because it is a larger item to ship, the package was vacuum-sealed, but I had absolutely no problems getting it out and fluffing it to its full potential size. I love how the size and versatility of the pillow's opening allows you to be very flexible with your sleeping options. I am a side sleeper, so I simply adjust the other side of the pillow so that it is touching my back to create a very comfortable cocoon.

The absolute best thing about this pillow is that it stays very cool. I am in Southern California, where we occasionally see 75-80 degree weather in January, so I was very happy to find that this pillow is great at cooling and overall temperature regulation. Overall, a great purchase - this pillow has allowed me to sleep like a baby. The only bad thing about this pillow is that it is not quite as full as I would have liked it, hence my 4-star rating.

"While the price is nice, the shipping was not. Combined, I would have liked a slightly heavier duty bag. While making kefir cheese, after pouring everything into the bag, I twisted the bag to form a ball and then applied slight pressure to help expedite the draining of whey. I was surprised to see some of the curd squeeze through the weave. Perhaps it was because I did not wait until the separation had occurred and the curd had become more dense.

I was hesitant to put much pressure on the bag after that, even after it had hung for about a half hour, but it is probably a good thing as I might have been even more aggressive and ruined the bag. This is far nicer than any cheesecloth you could buy, but I suggest being gentle with it.

I am certain that depending on what this is used for, you'll get different results. For Kefir, I think it was faster leaving it in a bowl, pouring off the liquid and repeating.

At the end of the day, I am glad I have this bag and would recommend it.",4.0,0

The others were cheaply made too. Very impressed with this. This light is a very bright light, not dim or dull. Good for safety or for night riding which I like. I feel much more safe with this light. It charges quickly and installation was super simple. This is water resistant as it claims for I took it through a torrential downpour that completely soaked me from head to toe. This light lasts very long, it says on the box for 3 hours and I have definitely had it on for that amount of time no problem. This is a well made quality product.

I've tried to find glass containers that fit this bag, and have been unsuccessful except for the 2 cup Pyrex that only fits in the bottom ""shelf""

the side net pockets are useless when the bottle holders are being used- too tight

there are loops for a shoulder strap but it does not come with one.

the Bottle sections hold a large quart mason jar and a large Blender Bottle easily. the Nutribullet container is tight but it will fit.

the containers hold enough for breakfast, lunch and dinner plus snacks and drinks. and has replaced all my other lunch bags i've purchased but just weren't quite right.

The scroll through menu is logical and easy to read. My only negatives were that it is virtually impossible to read in bright sunlight and the menu when going from MP3 player to other features is not as straightforward as I would like. Also MP3 player is the default mode. If you turn it off set to the radio, when you turn it on again it will be set in MP3 mode. That is not really a bug, but it is a bit of an annoyance.

"My son is an MMA athlete, and over the years we have discussed, and purchased, equipment. I know he has a similar pair, so I decided to see how these match up.

They fit my hands pretty well--they felt good, not too tight or loose. The padding is really thick. They can be put on and taken off easily. All the stitching seems very strong.

"I bought this case from a store for my new iPad (3rd gen). While it does fit, it would slip out of the smaller clips on the left side of the case that hold the device every once in awhile. Finally, after having it for only 4 days, one of the clips snapped. So, needless to say I'm looking for a new case...

Here's what I liked about the case:
 - Very thin, and didn't add much bulkiness to the device
 - Nice thick cover with soft inside, made me feel that the screen would be protected.
 - The faux-leather cover dosen't look too ""fake""

What I didn't like:
 - The band that is made to hold the device closed. I stopped using it after the first day. Don't they know that this will just break off? Plus, the cover stays closed well on it's own.

"There are several sized baskets among the reviews here; this is a review of the one they call the Medium.

The inside dimensions excluding the rounded top lip are just shy of 5-1/2"" wide by 15-1/2"" long by 5-3/4"" tall. The lip adds another 1/4"" to each side and the top thus the overall 6"" wide, 6"" deep and 16"" long in the specifications.

This is a nice sturdy basket, attractive, well made. It has sides which are pretty straight. Why is that important?

I'm picky but for a reason. Those with straight sides are better for organizing; the more slant on the sides of a basket the more it will take up excess room over the usable area, wasting storage space. You see too many of that kind on the market.

"Ordered these from Amazon but there was problem with 1-day shipping. Ended up getting them from Peter Glenn, as I needed them in time for a trip. But after experiencing them, I just had to come leave a review. I mostly wear Merino Wool dress socks, as my wardrobe is primarily comprised of suits. However, when I do wear sneakers, I solely wear Viscose socks made from Bamboo, which has a softness similar to or surpassing cashmere socks (depending on the brand), and have become quite spoiled by them. I was looking for a nice pair of Bamboo no-show socks, and I encountered this brand on Amazon. Eye-brow raised, because it had the best of both worlds in the composition (Merino Wool + Bamboo). So I ordered the Ultra-light version, and was surprisingly disappointed because that version was abrasive / scratchy; not soft at all. But there were so many great reviews on these socks, and I noticed there was a thicker version (Ultra-Light versus Light Cushion), so I decided to experiment and give them a try as I thought the thicker version might be softer. Well, I'm glad that I did, because these socks feel great. The feel is very comparable to Cariloha bamboo socks, which is the best pure bamboo viscose brand I've encountered and I've tried tonnes of brands. I'm glad that I tried this brand as Cariloha socks although there is a low cut version, they are not compression socks. Feetures! has the cashmere range level of softness, with the compressive benefits making it the all around best sports sock I've tried. I highly recommend it. My only complaints are that, first the socks are not truly ""no-show"" socks. It's very easy to see the socks, but I like that it doesn't cover my ankles. The other thing is the branding. I would've prefered more subtle branding, perhaps only a symbol / logo, but that's a personal style thing. It does not inhibit nor take away from the experience of the sock.",5.0,0

"I acquired this amazing product for cheap from BestBuy, because I think Dyson was renaming their DC series to ""V6"" at the time. In the past, the thought of dealing with cords and heavy vacuums typically prevailed over my urge to keep things clean, until such a time when everything just became intolerably dusty. However, with this vacuum, cleaning is actually kind of fun.

But what really inspired me to write this review was how awesomely and effectively this thing sucks up and kills bugs. Turn the ""Max"" setting on and no insect or arachnid shall escape its wrath. Suck them up from five feet away, spin them around and they are dead. I love this thing.",5.0,0

I bought so many expensive peelers- I have the peeler graveyard but all those expensive ones are no good because they gouge the flesh of fruits and vegetables. Use this!! it just skims the fruit or veg. so you only peel the skin and you have the fruit or veg. in tact.
Fresh thin carrots are the test- those other peelers gouged the carrot so you would see the middle. Use this because you can safely peel without ruining the carrot. You can sweep it back and forth rather fast also- it does a great job!!!!!!!",5.0,0

"Bought these for use while at the gym.  The sound is bad.  The connection to my phone is horrible.  This product is completely useless.
UPDATE :  I must say, this company certainly cares about making things right.  I bought a pair of these headphones last year and the results were bad.  SoundPEATS contacted me and offered me a new pair at no cost, the only request they had was that I consider updating my review.  I have used them for a week and the new set works great.  The sound is great for the price.  The range is nothing like the first set and I didn't have problems losing connection this time.  They come with several different ear bud options and once I figured out which ones worked for me they stay in my ear just fine.  The wire that connects them does make noise when it bounces if you are running but using the clips that come in the box completely solve the problem.  I got a solid 4 hours use out of them, could be longer but thats the longest I used them at once.  The voice prompts for volume and incoming calls are nice.  I don't know if SoundPEATS found a problem and fixed it or if I just got a bad pair the first time around but it was refreshing to have a company reach out and solve the original problem.  I would easily buy these again.",4.0,0

"I am very familiar with Carson, having owned a couple binoculars with HD glass. I used
those for surveillance work and for birding. One pair broke and they replaced them without
any questions. I very much appreciate the company. As for this monocular, I shopped around and looked at several and was about to pay a lot more
for a premium monocular when I decided that I didn't need it. I gambled on this unit, hoping
that I would not need the better glass of a more expensive one. It's a bit large, but I have
large hands. It isn't the easiest to focus with, but you become fairly adept at it quickly
enough. The quality seems good and I imagine that I will have this unit around for a long time. I teach firearms indoors and I needed a monocular to help my aging eyes see the. 22 caliber bullet
holes on black targets with dark backgrounds. I can readily see holes out to 20 yards with these
and I am very happy, especially at the pricepoint. I carry them in my jacket pocket for birding
when riding my motorcycle. Hech, I even tried the ant thing and it was impressive that I could
stand above an ant pile and watch them as if I was on my knees, like when I was a kid. I recommend this monocular and I promise you that you will like Carson as a brand, especially if
you have to contact them. I just wish that they would make a nice birding spotting scope. Regards and happy viewing.",5.0,0

"The mattress showed up on the doorstep in a box approximately 5 feet tall, and weighing around 50 lbs. Possible to move alone, but way better with a helper.

We opened one side of the box and slid the mattress onto our box spring. So surprised to find it vacuum sealed for maximum flatness! (Very helpful when putting it into position.)

The mattress started growing to size as soon as the plastic was cut, so I recommend having a plan to discard the plastic and to make sure the top and head/foot of the mattress are in their proper positions. Out of curiosity, we laid on it within 10 minutes of ""inflation"" and were already pleased with the amount of ""squish"", comfort, and support.

Upon returning from dinner, the bed was at it's advertised 10 inch mark and ready for another test. The ""sink"" was far more dramatic than the first go. Compared to other memory foam mattresses, the ""sink"" on this one is incredibly snug and articulate. Indentations were even made by the weight of my elbows.

Lumbar support is excellent. Head and neck support is very comfortable. I could probably sleep on this thing without a pillow.

It may be too squishy or soft for those who like a firmer bed, but time will tell and we may adjust. Also, fresh out of the box, it has an odd paint odor to it, so an open window and/or a fan is suggested.

In regards to the ""gel-infused cooling layer"", I admit that I was skeptical. Though, on this very hot day, I surprisingly have yet to sweat while lying on the bed. Consider me impressed.

"My husband loves to play his video games, unfortunately the couch is to far from the tv for him to play and was wanting some type of bean bag to use while playing. The chill bag bean bag is perfect!! Unlike normal bean bags this one is filled with little pieces of memory foam. The memory foam makes it extra comfy. It's 4 ft size and it easily fits my husband and my 4 year old. It comes in a medium size box and I wasn't expecting it to be in such a small box considering its size, the memory foam is condensed into a ball with plastic wrap around it, and the cover is seperate. Me and my two kids followed the instructions and carefully unwrapped the memory foam, once we got it out of the plastic wrap, I had the kids jump on it to loosen the memory foam and it quickly expanded. This bean bag is very sturdy and actually kinda heavy. You sink right into it and since it has memory foam instead of the tiny foam balls you can conform it to how your sitting. We love this ""bean bag"" !! When my husband isn't playing his video games and using it my kids are, it's a big hit at our house.

Allow to air dry every week. Yes, the fan is not silent, but some people like ""white noise"". This is meant to be a ""personal"" unit, meaning small and portable, takes up very little space!

"I have enjoyed using this coffeemaker on a daily basis.  I have not had the error problem that some reviewers have mentioned but I use a travel mug to fill the container for the single brew side which keeps it from overfilling. ,  I can't speak to the durability as yet since  have only had it for about 3 weeks but it works very well so far.
Update 9/21/14:  Have now had this for about 10 months.  It still works very well; am using on a daily basis and have not even had to do any deep cleaning(vinegar rinse etc).  Have been very satisfied with brew results from the k cups and from the carafe.  Not as satisfied with the single cup loose grounds brew though; don't use that option very often so haven't mastered the right portion of water for the strength I want.
The only errors I have had is when I wanted to brew a single cup but left the selector on the carafe setting.  That's ok thought as long as the carafe is always left in place because the single cup will just come out into the carafe. If you do not leave the carafe in place all the time though you would have a cup of coffee pouring onto the counter. If you do the opposite though and leave the selector on the single cup setting when you want to brew a carafe, it will not cause a problem because the machine just gives an error message and doesn't let the water come through - very clever, almost foolproof design.",5.0,0

"I am probably not the most qualified person on Amazon to write a review on headphones/ear buds, but with that said, I LOVE THESE! Since my children are kleptomaniacs regarding anything electronic that Mom has, I only buy the super cheap headphones - the ones available at the gas station, costing $1-2. This cheapness keeps me from losing it when my earphones ""disappear"" several times a week. I was getting a few other things on Amazon and decided to try these. and guess what? THEY ARE AWESOME! I love how they cancel outside noise and kind of create a seal in your ears. I love how you can distinguish between '80s rock and classic country with these. (Most of the earphones I've had made Johnny Cash sound like Axl Rose. ) I am truly surprised at how clear these make music sound and how well I can actually understand podcasts and comedy now. It's like going from an 8-track to a CD - yep, there is that much of a difference. I am now a Gummy convert and will only use these. I have purchased an extra pair and I keep them well hidden. Bottom Line: These are fantastic ear buds, especially for the price. The incredible sound these provide make walking the dogs a true joy - allowing me to disappear into a cloud of loud, clear music, piped comfortably into the hearing holes on each side of my head. and keeps out the interruptions caused by a bunch of extraneous noise. You absolutely cannot go wrong with these - and their low price just elevates them to perfection.",5.0,0

"I am a hot sleeper! My husband tells me that my body gives off so much heat that I'm like a furnace. That being said, I tend to sweat a lot in my sleep and a lot of the times I wake up from sweating so much. I sleep with a ceiling fan blowing on high and my tower fan blowing on high and I sleep with it on all year round, even when it gets to be below freezing because my body just gets too hot. Well, someone told me a while ago to try out a cooling gel pillow to sleep with to see if it helps so I ordered this gel memory foam pillow to see if maybe it did something for me. I tried it out and immediately felt the cooling sensation on the back of my neck and upper back but was it actually going to help keep me cool during the night to where I don't wake up from sweating. Yes! It did and does and I now do not sleep without this wonderful pillow. It has helped me get longer sleep since I'm not waking in the night. I am so pleased with this pillow and I would absolutely recommend it to anyone who is a hot sleeper like I am or even if you just like a cold feeling pillow. I love this pillow. I would not sleep on it alone though, I put it on top of my other pillow and it's perfect. I hope this helps you make a purchase!

"UPDATE 8/8/2012: I haven't had the case/cover for 3 months, yet...and it's already showing signs of falling apart. I use the case/cover at home and for one class I'm taking, and after a short 3 months it's surface material is cracking and starting to peel off where the cover folds (multiple locations). I do like the case, but it's going to look very ratty in a few more months. At this rate I'll need a case every 3-4 months and that quickly ads up over a year's time frame (which would be an acceptable amount of time for a single case/cover to survive).

Old Review: Great case for the iPad. This thing goes in and out of my back pack, loose leaf binder, and around campus. It's a simple design-in black-and most folks don't know it's an iPad until I open the cover. I just need to learn and not show off, so this fits the need perfectly. I would have given 5 stars, but I find the cover sometimes moves enough that the unlock screen will come on.

"seSo I've owned this about a month. I was so impressed by the specs when placed next to the cost it was an easy win. I was concerned ONLY about the issue regarding the hinge but as just about every laptop has a downside I thought I'd risk it. Well I'm feeling pretty bad about this because though the price seems good for the specs a $1200 laptop is not budget and the three things I depend on every time I turn on the unit is DISPLAY, TRACKPAD AND KEYBOARD. Keyboard is a biggie for me and I give it a favourable rating. Trackpad is giving me hell. I had a great time with the synaptics software on my the lenovo I traded this in for. But the software that supports this trackpad is oversenstive. Cursor flies all over the place doing all kinds of madness while I'm typing. Constantly stopping to undo what it has done. Not a soul at ASus has replied to that query. Display was NEVER  a feature I spend alot of time on before because displays just did what displays should do but this yellow tint on the unit that so many other complain of that I didn't realise before makes my eyes hurt.

"I bought this for my Windows 7 Desktop PC.  I was tired of running a cord from my router in the bedroom to the living room where the PC resides.  I have a Linksys e3000 Router which is a top of the line router.  I wanted a wireless USB device which would allow me to have a full 300MB/s connection.  This one fit the bill and was reasonably priced so I went with it.  After downloading the right drivers from the web I was set to go.  Unfortunately, I could not get a connection higher than 130MB/s.  It seems this device will only work at the full 300MB/S on the 2.4GHz band (not the 5GHz band) and only at the wider channel widths.  I set my router up this way but this would still not pick up at the full 300MB/s.

This would have been bad but not a deal breaker.  But then the device would not keep a stable connection.  It would keep dropping the connection despite the fact that the router was working just fine.  Confirmed this by using my iPad, iPhone, and my Windows laptop to connect to my router every time the connection went down.  They all worked fine.

The connectors, even if they were well placed, are hard to use; but they're crammed together such that my not-very-big fingers had a heck of a time connecting the speakers.

"I've used several different Hoovers and Eurekas in recent years, so I have some perspective on vacuum cleaners in this price category, both bagged and bagless, and so far, I'm finding the Bissell measures up well.  I didn't think of Bissell as a top vacuum cleaner brand (I think of them as making rug shampooers), but I've been impressed.

PROS:

It has good suction--my first use produced that ""Wow"" when you see how much dirt was in the carpet you thought was pretty clean;

It has multiple filters that are washable, so there are no maintenance costs for bags or filters;

The powered upholstery attachment with spinning beater brush works great--much better than just having a little brush attachment that pushes the hair around;

It's extremely easy to assemble (one screw);

It's sturdy and solid for the price;

It's not the lightest I've used (that would be the Eureka Lightspeed, which started to fall apart almost immediately), but it's not overly heavy or bulky--it's a good weight;

It's no more noisy than any of the other similarly-priced vacuums I've used;

The extension hose doesn't have to be placed into a hole every time you want to use it and then pulled out afterwards, unlike some other models--it's always attached to the suction, so all you have to do is pull it out and start using it; and

The canister comes off and goes back in very easily--more easily than some I've used--and can be easily emptied.

CONS:

I find little to complain about with this unit, but like all of the other vacuum cleaners I've used, the cord doesn't retract, so you have to always keep it out of the way as you vacuum.  Others have said the cord could be longer; I find it's about average, but sure, a little longer wouldn't hurt (although then there's more to keep out of the way).",4.0,0

My room mate was also developing hand problems, and I brought an amazon basics keyboard for him and told him to use it to help with his hand problems. He said his hand problems are gone too.

So, I'm not going to claim that this keyboard fixes hand problems because it could have in fact been a coincidence as me and my room mate were both trying other things to fix our hand issues. But shortly after we switched to the amazon keyboards, our issues were gone, so it *could* be the case that this keyboard helps prevent hand issues for some people.",5.0,0

"Before purchasing I was a little leary, both of the bright room concerns voiced earlier and of buying from an Amazon associated company, not Amazon itself.  Purchasing a month ago, both fears were unfounded.

Electronic Express was fine, shipping on Monday after a Friday order via FedEx Ground.  The box was strapped vertically to a pallet and the driver helped removing it from the pallet and using a hydraulic platform to get it to the ground and into the house.  Net result:  no shipping nor delivery problems.  The set worked perfectly upon arrival.

As to the picture and operations, I have it on an HDMI connection from a DirecTV HD satellite connection.  The black level is as astonishing as they advertise and the picture as clean and crisp as I observed earlier (at a Sears where they had this, the Sharp and the Sony side-by-side, with the Samsung as good as the Sony and much better than the Sharp).

We are in Florida, where the sun is known to be particularly bright and this room has huge western sky facing windows.  There is a little sun glare and reflection in the very late afternoon but all parts of the screen are still easily viewable and after a few minutes any annoyance from glare and reflection is tuned out by one's eyes.  In sort, there's no problem here with the issue.

Highly recommended for the price and overall quality.

Addendum (December 2009):  Well, a month after the warranty expired, so did this product.  I had an authorized Samsung repair shop look at it and the LCD drivers had failed.  Great, I thought, a simple circuit board change.  WRONG!  That circuit board was ""married"" to the display so the entire display needed to be replaced.  $1500 plus labor!  Short result:  the Samsung was junked and a reliable Sony replacement purchased.  Star rating reflects the unconscionable cost of repair of a somewhat simple problem.",1.0,0

"There are so many kitchen gadgets now that look cute, but really don't do what they promise.  You end up feeling cheated and tossing them out because they aren't worth the storage space they take up.  I'll admit that I figured this would be one of those gadgets.

I remember when the only time we had avocados is when relatives visited from Florida.  Now the stores here carry them, although they are unripe, so you can't eat them immediately.  I had to wait several days for my guinea pig avocado to ripen so that I could test the slicer.

You use the plastic ""knife"" part to cut the avocado length-wise and then you remove the part that isn't sticking to the pit.  This is the thing that surprised me, but the two halves came apart quite easily.  The instructions say to ""press the pitter into the pit.""  I couldn't get the metal parts to go INTO the pit, but they loosened it enough that it fell out when I turned the avocado over.  Job accomplished.

Then you position the slicer over the avocado half and pull it through.  Amazingly, it removes all the pulp in nice, neat little slices.  I've always peeled avocados and then cut the edible part off the pit in irregular slices.  It looks messy and there's a lot of waste. Using the slicer is a big improvement.

I'm leery of kitchen gadgets, but this one does exactly what it promises, is sturdy, doesn't take up much room in the drawer, and cleans up easily after you use it.  It's well worth the modest price.

"Since I just recently purchased this lens, I noticed a few things.

First, the lens is so small that it's not easy to get around. This is a very large lens with a small lens hood.

Second, it's not very compact. If you have a large camera, it's a huge difference between a medium-sized lens and a compact one.

"The dock works great, and it clears up a lot of space on my desk at work. I have this connected to a 28"" 4k monitor, so the desk is nice and minimalistic with plenty of computer workspace to get work done.

My only complaint with this dock is the length of the extension cables coming out of the dock. They are simple pass-through cables, letting you plug your device cables into the ports on your macbook without needing to take apart the dock every time you need to change a cable. For things like USB, its perfect. However, the cables are all 2+ feet long. It is excessive. The thick bunch of white cables coming out of the back of the dock is difficult to manage and keep out of the way. I would have preferred to have cables only a few inches long, so that I can plug my cables in close to the back of the dock.",4.0,0

"An immediate return to Amazon, on their dime. Let the buyer beware. The holster provides more of a ""generic"" fit, intended for use with several pistol models. That should have been enough of a warning for me. I don't know how well it fits the other pistols, but it was very difficult to insert my Ruger LC9s Pro. After forcing it all the way in, the trigger guard was only half covered, which is not how it is shown in the photo. Once holstered, the fit was way too tight to allow an effective draw, and there is no way to adjust the holster's retention. I had expected a holster similar to the one I purchased for my Glock 42 (http://www.amazon.com/Fobus-tactical-Paddle-Holster-Security/dp/B00PBJ9URO/), which fits only that pistol and has adjustable retention.

"Let me begin by saying my husband and I got married on a really tight budget.  So we've had to think outside the box to have what wealthier folks might take for granted.  One of those areas revolved around our wedding bands.

Originally we had purchased tungsten rings. Wow. Bad move.  Apparently with tungsten you'll lose your finger before you lose your ring.  You can't cut those things off.  And being that my husband works in a very hands on field, I didn't like the idea of him having to lose his finger just because his ring wouldn't come off.

So we have these silicon ones a try. And I must say that I'm in love.  They are SOOO flexible and stylish! They are easy to do work with and I don't worry about losing a stone or anything.  They not only serve the purpose of a ring, but they also take ring wearing on a non-traditional route that I especially appreciate.  And they come in three different colors and these really nice felt bags for storage!  They are super cool! And they are priced so affordably.

But I think the biggest selling factor for me was the customer service.  We were contacted by, who I believe was the owner to make sure we were satisfied with our product.  Wow! For a ring priced for the average person, that was definitely above average service.  That sold it for me.

I highly recommend this ring to anyone who wants to get a nice symbol of your union but on a budget.  We are extremely satisfied with our purchase and hope you will be as well.

"I can honestly say I am famous for my mashed potatoes within my family and my husband's family. Every family dinner or get together that calls for mashed potatoes, there's no discussion on whose making it- everyone knows it's me. I'll take the title as the mashed potato master.

I have gone through endless amounts of potato mashers and have had handles fall off on me a few times. I just hated the design on them as I would get faitued easily. It's a workout- you'll definitely break a sweat mashing potatoes for 20 people!

When I saw this masher and the handle design I had to have it. Upon opening the package, I was so excited when I picked it up and felt how comfortable it was in my hand, and most importantly how strong and sturdy it was. There is no flimsiness to it what so ever.

I put it to the test with loaded mashed potatoes (sour cream, chives, bacon, cheddar cheese, the works). You can apply much more pressure with little effort and mash more effectively without tiring yourself out. The consistency also turned out better. This is exactly what I needed! I will use this masher so often and I have no concerns of it failing on me. My family members all want one now too. Thank you for making my job easier eternal chef!

"The day after I ordered this my husband came home with a DC40 Animal which he got at a warehouse store for way less.  Since it was a gift and included an upholstery brush I kept it and returned the one I ordered which, as an aside, was super easy.

I love the Dyson.  While it's kind of heavy and the ball thing is awkward the cleaning power is phenomenal. Don't have carpeting but the area rugs look almost new.
Am kind of partial to bagless vacs...gives me an instant return on my efforts by seeing what I've actually picked up and this canister is easy to empty.

The cord is plenty long as is the hose, great for my high ceilinged rooms.

The time to assemble the machine was approx 10 minutes, so easy I wondered if I had done it right.  Have read complaints about the instruction manual but I found it as adequate as I needed it to be.

Another thing which convinced me that the Dyson cleans better than any machine I've owned is that after a weekly vac I can use my Roomba and the little robot doesn't constantly bog down and need cleaning.  It can complete an entire cleaning cycle without begging for help.  In a household with 2 dogs and a cat that is something.

Yeah, I love my Dyson and so does the iRobot. We're both happy now.",5.0,0

"I have back and foot injuries, so low impact exercising is a must for me at the moment (hoping this will someday change). This trampoline is about as low impact as a a vertical land/terrestrial unit can be.

The first few times I tried this trampoline, I had to focus on balance, but I adjusted quickly enough. Because spring coils are not used in this trampoline, it has a quieter action than traditional mini trampolines. It is a very sturdy unit. Absolutely love this thing. The ""petals"" help to widen the jumping surface, and also help warn me (when my foot feels the petal edges) when I am straying too far from the center of the trampoline. My college age daughter now comes to my room every day to exercise on the trampoline as well :).

"I was looking for some sturdy, good quality stainless pots and pans, but I couldn't afford the all-clads. I did a lot of research, and I came across this set. I even saw some of the pots on America's Test Kitchen saying that they were their top cheap choice for pots.

I knew that some people complained about discoloration when cooking, well, I found out that most stainless will discolor with normal use. I have indeed had my pots discolor if I do not clean them properly (chore-boy) or if I have cooked something for a really long time in them. In my experience, I learned that if there is anything stuck to the pans, boil water in them and it will take off just about anything. Also, if they do discolor, that will usually go away after I use them again.

As far as the whole eggs stick thing, yes they will. You have to lower your stove temp considerably to cook delicate things as the aluminum core really heats up well. Also, learn how to cook in stainless. That means look it up on the net etc until you are used to them. It takes some time and some burnt food in the meantime until you get the hang of it, especially coming from non-stick. Also, butter isn't the best for keeping food from sticking. Smart balance or pam works the best.

Really, I have been able to cook some great things that I couldn't cook easily with my old set. First of all, these can go into the oven and the dishwasher, two benefits over my old set. Also, I get a much better browning on meats and other foods with this set.

Overall, I really like this set a lot. I would eventually like all-clad, but for less than the cost of a single pan, I got the whole set of Cuisinart. I think it worked out well.",4.0,0

"I bough this when I was living out in Missouri for a year. The water there is about a foul as the people, so in turn I went to wal-mart or the air base base there to get fresh filtered water. Filled this thing up every week for over a year strait. hauled it in the back of my pickup and it did get knocked around quite a bit sometimes. No problems with it though, never, not once. I guess the only thing that could give you problems would be the spout, but you can always buy a new one of those very cheap and replace it in seconds if you happen to break one.

I now live out in England where the water is very, VERY hard! I use a brita filter and it works just great. I keep this filled with water from my brita now to always have a more abundant amount of fresh filtered water available. I use filtered water for everything; drinking, cooking, ice, tea kettle so it's nice not to have to wait for the the small brita jug to refill.

You can use this with just strait tap water if your water quality is good enough for your liking. If the water goes off for some reason you have a small store of it. 5 gallon will last 1 person about 5 - 10 days depending how much you consume a day. Fill it up with your garden hose and bring it alone in a truck for days out where you might not have any fresh water to drink. It's a tough jug, it can hold it's own! :)",5.0,0

One, as others have said, you have to really push the button to open the door, which causes the microwave to move around on the counter top if you don't have it backed up completely against the wall (and even then it still moves around slightly). Two, all of the front stainless steel trim and the push button door opener is a FINGERPRINT MAGNET. Other than those two minor things, it looks nice and works nice, and am glad we purchased it. I haven't tried all the features, but the sensor reheat function works great, and the defrost seems to work very nicely as well.

The sheath is nothing special, but it does hold the knife real well and seems well made, the 2 mods I made to this knife are, I polished the blade for that extra bing bling effect, and put an edge on top of the blade, it is a real killer now, ultra sharp before but now the top edge cuts as well, it makes for a great fighting/defense blade as it is compact and well balanced.

"Back when I first started leaning how to cook, I also learned I really hated peeling potatoes. Until I got one of those automatic peelers. It was great until the company that made it went out of business and I could no longer get replacement blades. But now I have the Peeler/Shredder/Spiral cutter from Nostalgia and I can cook again!

OK maybe it is not that revolutionary, but it is a great tool for your kitchen and it has so many more options than just peeling. You can Shred various vegetables and fruit. You can spiral cut too. You can even cut you own potato chips, at least you can if your deep fryer still works (that will be my next review).

The negatives are that it is made of rather flimsy plastic, so I don't know just how durable it will be in the long run. The storage in nice but the door does not close right due to the cheep plastic.

Overall a nice addition to your kitchen tool collection, especially if medical issues make peeling difficult for you. Also if you are a creative chef, the spiral cut and shredding options should inspire you to Iron Chef levels.",3.0,0

Lots of accessories. everything you need to get started vice a  SD card is in the box. including a short HDMI cable. Cons. 1. Terrible video quality. just terrible. grainy  and washed out. you will not be able to read a license plate of a car parked just in front and to the left or right of you. 2. Operation is not intuitive. crazyest sequence of button pushes I've ever experienced. the 'OK' button is not always 'Ok'. button pushing is on par with entering a cheat code in a video game console. I. e. UP, DOWN, MODE, UP, OK, MENU, MODE , UP, DOWN, UP, UP. argghh. 3. Freezes constantly. tape a paper clip to the side of it as your going to need to reset it constantly. 4. Received a used or open box unit. everything was there, but there were fingerprints all over the lense, the instruction manual was all bent to crap,  the protective film and zip lock bags the originally held the pieces where all at the bottom of the box. This was returned (and would have been anyway since it was pre-owned/used). I have ordered a main-stream GARMIN to take its place.",1.0,0

"I ordered these for a party.  I will not be re-ordering.

The image displayed is not the image of the item being sold.  These Ping Pong balls have 1 long continuous groove running in the center of the ball; the groove divides the sphere into two equal-sized semi-spheres.  The words ""Made in China"" are stamped in black ink on each ball.  They also don't bounce like normal Ping Pong balls.  This last issue would be a total deal-breaker if I had purchased these for Ping Pong.  But that is not what they were purchased for!  They served their purpose, and were inexpensive enough which is why they get 2 stars.  I won't be reordering, I'll just go to Dick's or other sporting goods store to pick them as needed.

"Great ab wheel. The double wheels give it a lot more control and the smaller wheel size creates the ability to get closer to the ground on the roll out.

"I've had my XTi for just over a month now (bought from Amazon) and it's really improved my photography.  Others have even commented that I've ""shifted to a new gear"".  Features are a nice improvement from the DSLR-wannabe I had before (Panasonic FZ30) but it's the image quality that's really the big step up.  Get the best-quality lenses for this (*not* the kit lens) and you'll be very happy.

Pros:

* Image Quality
* Ergonomics (most common settings are easy to change, good displays)
* Battery life (200 shots with 50% flash and battery still said 100%)
* The user manual is decent, though not stellar.
* Long exposure noise reduction feature is very good.
* Good set of customization options (though the manual doesn't explain them enough).

Cons:

* Canon's organizer/editor software, Digital Photo Professional, always crashes on my Windows PC and technical support was no help.
* Hand grip is too small (height and volume) for my large hand.  Make sure you handle one first.  I had to train myself to squish all three fingers into the space provided so my pinky didn't hang off the bottom.  This is a real step backwards from the original Digital Rebel.
* Some settings that I use a lot are hidden too far in the menus.
* Sensor dust cleaner won't get everything.  I had to manually blow dust off the sensor (with a blower, *NOT* my breath!) about 1 week after I got this, though no sensor dust since.

Conclusion:
I'm *very* glad I bought this camera and look forward to many years using it.

BTW, Amazon farms this order out to another vendor, so you won't get free shipping and you'll have to contact that vendor separately to get an order tracking number.

I can't say how long it will be, but it's a nice accessory.I bought these to use when I ride my bike at night. They are a little hard to pull off the seat but I do. I ordered the four on the low end because I was afraid of them being too tight. They are very comfortable and they fit well and are very comfortable.

I do wish they had a large head to make it easier to wear them on my head. They are adjustable and they are a little tight on my head. I have a small head",4.0,1

"I've never spent more than $100 on a pair of headphones before, so I can't really compare these to other high end cans, but I absolutely love the accurate, high quality sound reproduction of these headphones! Materials quality and style are superb as well. After reading many reviews, I decided these would offer the best sound quality within my budget of less than $200, and I'm very happy with my purchase! Like other reviewers said, these offer very accurate sound reproduction. They have plenty of tight, punchy bass when it's recorded in the music, but it's not overpowering. If you're looking for exaggerated, skull-rattling bass, these probably aren't the phones for you. I use them to listen to Tidal lossless audio streaming, and the result is a stellar listening experience.",5.0,0

"This bike rack is great and does exactly what I needed to do--hang my bike vertically off a wall in my home. The included hardware worked great and allowed me to anchor into the drywall of the wall that I hung the bike from. In the end it allowed me to save a lot of space in my small studio.

The dimensions of this rack are 9 inches tall by 3 inches wide. The top hook that goes around the tire sticks out 4.5 inches. The bottom part that sticks out a bit on either side of the bike rim sticks out about 1.5 inches.
Included in this set is the bike rack and the hardware needed to mount it.

Pros:
*Saves a ton of room
*Hardware included that worked well
*Easy to install

Cons:
*None

Additional Considerations:
Be aware, this is a vertical storage system, not a horizontal one. Additionally you will want to make sure the bike is not ran into a lot or you could damage the bike or the wall that the bike rack is mounted into.

Overall: 5/5 stars (>=.5 rounds up, <.5 rounds down) => 5 stars

"This is a good down pillow at a great price. I bought my first down pillow over 10 years ago after a lot of testing. No, it wasn't this one -- but it also was three times the price of this one.

When we got our Tempurpedic bed, I switched to the Tempurpedic pillow for a couple of years. But I wasn't able to lay on my side as much because I couldn't breathe as well. So I kept my eyes open for a good lower-priced down pillow.

I stayed at several Hilton and Hilton Garden Inn hotels that featured the Touch-of-Down pillow sets. Several times this pillow stuck out as my favorite. On one trip I wrote down the details to check into it later. But I couldn't wait so I ordered it while I was at the hotel.

I'm liking it. For an across-the-board comparison it would only get 4 stars compared to my earlier 5 star down pillow. But at one-third the price, it's a 5 star in its own right.

It is basically a pillow within a pillow, but only occasionally can I tell that. The inner section gives a little more support, but I don't know that I need it myself.

The only downside was that I had to buy the protective cover separately -- on my earlier more expensive down pillow it came stock with the pillow -- which was probably another reason it was more expensive.

If you really want to try out some pillows (down, synthetic, and mixed) try one of the Hilton hotels with the Touch-of-Down program. My visits have been on business trips, but they could be romantic nights out or any other reason. It's kinda like renting a car to try it before actually forking over the money -- a worthwhile expense.",5.0,0

"I've used OtterBox before for my phones and have had nothing but great things to say about them so I was interested to see what they do with an iPad case.

Unfortunately, my experience was not the best. Don't get me wrong, the case is fantastic at what it does: protect your iPad. It's not just a good fit for how I use my iPad.

The majority of the time I use it, I'm holding it. I tried every way I could think of but the floppy folding cover was just not comfortable in my hands. A lot of the apps I use require it to be in landscape mode and the edge of the case by the home button moves away too easily when holding it this way.

Probably my biggest issue is the clasp. Maybe it's the kind of thing that will loosen up a bit with use but it is difficult to open. It's not a huge inconvenience to have to futz with it a few seconds but the fact that I have to means there is a problem.

Overall, this is a decent iPad case. It's not for me, but a lot of people have given it great reviews so maybe it'll be good for you.",3.0,0
"I would give it 0 stars. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the one time I hooked it up to the TV, it would not connect to the TV. This is because the HDMI cable is in the same location as the one in the TV. If you have the TV plugged into the TV, the HDMI cable will not connect to the TV. If you have the TV plugged into the TV, it will not connect to the TV. It's very frustrating.

I had to hook up the HDMI cable to the TV to get it to work. This is a huge pain and takes a lot of time. I don't want to have to get the TV hooked up to the TV to make it work. It would be nice if there were a way to do that with the other cables.

"As other reviewers have noted, the flange holding the foil cutter is highly susceptible to breaking.  Before I even used my device to open a bottle of wine, one of those flanges had broken off and the foil cutter would no longer stay in place on top of the opener. There is clearly a design flaw here. I didn't even bother to try opening a bottle after that.  Incidentally, the instructions accompanying this opener warned that it might not be able to remove some corks, so it would probably be a good idea to hold onto your old corkscrew.

"I purchased this after a friend recommended it to me.  I am not a power baker.  I merely make the usual things for my family and the occasional specialty items.  I find it mixes faster than my old stand mixer, and it takes less space on my counter.  Contrary to other reviewers, I find it does cream sugar and butter well, BUT I have to use a rubber spatula to push it off the center post.  MY machine came with instructions to NOT use the center addition for the smaller jobs like this since it produces better results, so that is how I have done it.

In addition, I noticed straightaway that the directions stated to ensure you run the machine at least 5 minutes before you do ANYTHING in it to make sure the lubricants do their job BEFORE you use it for mixing. I did that, and I've heard no odd noises coming from my machine.

It IS loud.....much louder than my stand mixer, but I wasn't going for a silent machine.  Frankly, I have dexterity issues, and I wanted one that wasn't overly heavy, with a bowl that wasn't overly heavy, and that was easy to clean without having to wrestle it all over the kitchen (with my issues, that's common).  My friend suggested that this would probably tick off all those checkboxes, and she was right.

For what I use it for, I LOVE it.  It is also easy to clean, the parts store in the top, and it does what I ask it to.  I also got the blender attachment with mine, and it blends stuff that my bullet cannot.  I don't use it OVERLY often, but when I need a blender, it's a champ.

"I wanted this automatic toothbrush dispenser for my son. He is 6  with high functioning Autism. Im trying to teach him to be more independent. He knows how to brush his teeth, but has a hard time getting the cap off the tooth paste and squeezing it to get the paste out. When I saw this on Amazon, I knew I had to get it. Plus, he loves animals and the tiger is so cute.

Here are my only CONS:

-It took FOREVER to arrive in the mail.
-The word automatic is a little misleading. When I think automatic, I think you put your brush in and the past automatically comes out. With this you actually put your brush in and push on something and then the toothpaste comes out. It has worked out OK, but I wanted to point that out to potential buyers.
-Directions were a little tricky, as it was in Chinese, but I did find some small print English in there (just took me a while to locate it)

The positives:

-My son can now independently get the toothpaste on his brush and brush his teeth without my assistance.
-The suction cup has help up just fine! It is on our mirror right above the faucet.
-So far, it has been compatible with all toothpastes Ive bought.

All in all, this is cute and decent for the price!

"Had my first overnight backpacking trip to the Rocky Mountains in January of this year, I was pretty nervous.  I had a lot of stuff to get through and was nervous about how it would go.  It was in the middle of the night.  I had some water in the tent and a tent bag with a fire starter and some food.  It was a little rough but I didn't have to worry about it getting destroyed by the night.  It was very dry.  I thought I would be fine with it but I felt like I had gotten a ""bad"" tent bag.  I put it in the back of my truck and put my pack in the back of my truck.  I was a bit nervous but I am glad I didn't.  I will be putting this tent back in the truck for a couple weeks and hopefully I will be able to figure out a way to keep the tent from getting destroyed by the night.  I will probably buy a tent from Amazon next time and get some of the other stuff I need to go back to the camp site.  I was very excited to get this tent and was very happy with the purchase.  It was very comfortable.  I was able to put my stuff in the tent and make it stay in the tent.  I had some small stuff that I wanted to keep in the tent but I was able to put my water bottle in the tent.  I am a big fan of Amazon and they have a lot of stuff.

My only ctitique is this particular one doesnt come with the hardware you need to secure it in your bedrails (which i didn't realize at the time of purchase) so be sure to purchase one with the hardware unless you feel like fabbing up your own. Although solid, the price is still a lot for a locking clutch, especially if you want to purchase two to transport multiple bikes, which why i'm giving it four stars.",4.0,0

"In the age of digital revolution that metamorphosed photography for ever there is little reason to buy an analog product. A product with a large size and cumbersome function. rather than take hundreds of photos before you think of changing your memory card you are limited to 10 small expensive prints.
So why did I buy it. And how come did I give it five stars. Will here are the reasons;
1. I had realistic expectations for what I was getting into.
2. I love photography in all it's shapes and forms.
3. Again I had realistic expectation.
4. I'm into fun stuff
5. I'm sentimental for the old days.
look at reasons 1 and 3 again. some people buy things with inflated expectations and then get disappointed with what they have.
Honestly the photo quality was way way much better than I expected. The colors are vivid and vibrant and the focus is really sharp. The camera has for simple different settings for light conditions and an automatic flash which did a really good job for foreground lighting. The photos are small but that was a compromise I'm willing to make. They are expensive $1 per print, to me that makes them more precious.
In this day of digital we are so used to click click click with our digital cameras and our cellphones. We take thousands of photos and print literally zeros. The photos we take are free so we don't think twice of click click click. With this Polaroid and $1 per print price tag I enjoyed the click and the ""Shake it like a Polaroid picture"" and the sharing with others. It is really really fun.
But I have no illusions. And I want you to have none. This is a novelty / speciality item. It will not replace my DSLR or my point and shooter it will compliment them and thus I'm really happy with my purchase and if you buy this camera with a realistic expectations and if you are a sentimental guy/gal you will enjoy it like I am.",5.0,0

"These ice packs are perfect for my family. We are slowly integrating our children into school after years of homeschooling and now have to deal with sending a lunch - mostly sandwiches or other cold items. I needed something to keep the food cold for just a few hours, but not too bulky either.

These thin, bread size ice packs are perfect. They are less than  thick and like I said the size of a slice of bread. They fit perfectly into a Bento lunchbox we own and even a small metal box. (I have included pictures so you can see.) Plus, being so thin a sandwich or other food items still fit in the container. So many of my other ice packs are bulky and take up so much room I have no space left for the food.

The ice pack stays cool long enough to keep the food chilled until lunch time. And if I feel the food needs some extra coldness, due to the thin nature of the ice pack, I can place one on the bottom and one on the top.

They are easy to clean. I just rinse them off, or if they get quite a bit of food on them, I just wash in some sudsy water. They re-chill quickly in the freezer and are always ready for the next day. Plus, again due to the thinness, they do not take up a huge amount of space in my already cramped freezer. And, the best part, being a hard plastic they do not get holes and leak all over. I have had way too many ice packs leak.

One thing I'd like to add is the ice pack has a ""food"" side and a ""lid"" side. I don't see a difference?

Pros:
Thin (less than  thick)
Size of a slice of bread
Keep food cold for at least 4 hrs.
Hard plastic and do not leak
Easy cleaning
Do not take up a lot of space in the freezer

Cons:
Do not stay cold all day

"I bought this for my wife. She hates learning new electronics and is quite picky about things like this. She loves it! First unlike the fitbit which is listed as Water Resistant to 10M (But Fitbit SPECIFICALLY advises not to Swim or Shower with it) this device is approved by Polar for swimming and showering. The touch sensor scrolls through the different info easily (it also pairs to the app or H7 Heart rate monitor with one touch). She LOVES the simplicity! It seems to be very accurate and GOOD LORD this thing charges at TURBO SPEED! I will go as far to say that I have never owned ANY device that charges as fast as this, it is UNREAL. Yes you have to cut the thing to size initially but I like that feature. They send a foolproof measuring tape (it does not have mm, cm or inches it just tells you how much notches to count down and clip). I found that even with that tape it is conservative by one notch just to be safe. Once you trim it you instal a double action stainless clasp (very similar to the one on a $500.00 watch) which engages securely and feels quality made. I put it on before sizing it and it looks just at home on my wrist or my wifes. Subtle chrome accents set the face off adn compliment the clasp. My wife is very petite and it sized down to her well and she says it is quite comfortable. The display is very bright when on and easy to read (it is off by default but barely brushing the touch sensor with a finger shows the time or cycles through the modes immediately.

I have never been able to skid the front tire when braking on pavement. Even at full tire pressure they will squat slightly under maximum braking into a big footprint that really grips the road.

I run two 26X2.00's on my full suspension mountain bike converted for touring. They are not heavy and roll easy and handle well on pavement and gravel trails like the C&O canal path. You can fold a spare tire to make it easier to carry. Over many years and many miles I have never had a flat. The reflective stripe on the side walls shows up very well at night and increases visibility from the side tremendously. They are wearing well. To get used to the handling characteristics of these tires I tried rolling off and back on the bike trail pavement edges many times at medium speeds to see if it might throw me off but these tires are amazing at tracking well with no surprises. They climb right back up a parallel ridge or lip smooth and easy and predictable. Fat tires like these Marathon Supremes ride plush and handle great without slowing you down. I would recommend these tires highly to anyone.,5.0,0

"This is a nice inexpensive sauce pan I think has middle-grade quality. In size, this little pot is suitable for making a 1 to 2 cup sauce from a rue. Two cups would be pushing it, and more I would advise against, since you have to have room to stir and/or whisk. Since the little pan is Teflon lined I'd suggest you only use  soft, heat resistant silicone utensils. And since the pot is small, one of the smallest whisks. I've tested the pot by making a sauce, melting butter, and by boiling chicken livers for my pups. What I found is that the heating is even, and that the Teflon surface works great. Chicken livers, you see, turn out to leave behind a foamy and sticky protein residue which can be tough to clean up even when on Teflon. I like the ceramic exterior, by the way. It doesn't show water spots or fingerprints. Unfortunately it's unattractive. This surprised me because I like speckle-ware, and I like the color red. The combo on this pot however just didn't work for me. So while I like this little pot (which does not come with a lid), I like it more as an accent piece in the kitchen and I know I'd not like a complete set of it. Would just be too much. Other things I would note is that the handle stayed cool and you absolutely should not put any Teflon pan in the dishwaster. Thoughtfully designed to have pour spouts for both lefties and righties, this is a nice pan (not upscale, but nice) for very little money.",4.0,0

"I purchased the Paula Deen steamer as a replacement for a Cuisinart steamer so I'll be comparing it to that.  Overall, the PD unit is pretty well made.  It's lightweight, but not thin walled.  The steamer fits very snug to the pot and does an admirable job letting condensed water seep through the holes.  I thought it did a better job of this then the Cuisinart unit.  This is probably due to the slightly larger steamer holes in this unit.

What I love most about this steamer is the rubber like wrapping of the handles and lid.  This keeps both the steamer and the lid cool enough to handle even when the pot has been boiling for a long time.  The Cuisinart did not have this and it's definitely a plus!  What's also better in the PD steamer is its resistance to staining; cleaning up is pretty easy.

What I don't like is what keeps this unit from getting 5 stars; the design of the base.  The base has a concave design, that is it's flat on the outside, but the metal depresses in towards the middle.  Why is that a problem?  Because this means the bottom doesn't get full contact with the ceramic stovetop that I use which means I spend more time waiting for water to boil, alot more time then the Cuisinart.  The PD unit has a copper plated bottom, which should mean a faster and more efficient heat transfer, but there's just not enough of the metal to make contact.  If you're using a gas stove, then this is irrelevant.  I'm guessing it was designed this way to save money by cutting material costs, but it will end up costing me more in the long run with a higher electric bill.  I would have gladly paid $5 more if the bottom were flat.

Overall I am happy with the purchase and would buy it again if I had to.",4.0,0

"Okay, I actually have one of these, was given as a gift at xmas.  It works fine, the machine is crazy simple (nothing electric, just a lever) and the CO2 cartridge is very easy to install and remove.  Because the person giving the gift bought them I have two bottles and two of the 4oz cartridges.  I personally get 11 liters from the 4oz charge (I've been keeping track to see and that's been pretty consistent).

At the moment you can at least go to Bed Bath and Beyond stores and EXCHANGE the small cartridge for $10 (buying an extra filled one off the shelf costs $20).  You just go to the cashier/service desk there and they'll have a box of refilled ones behind the counter that they'll swap with you and charge $9.99.

But they promise 16oz cartridges as an option and I have yet to find these available anywhere.  Just thinking as reading this I should contact Cuisinart and ask where I can get one.  For heavy use you probably don't want to buy one of these for yourself at least until the 16oz cartridges are reasonably available and able to be exchanged at the lower price.  I wouldn't expect to ever come out ahead on cost even with with the larger cartridge.  I mean, I can buy some bottles of plain seltzer (which is mainly what I'm making) for about 70 cents a liter.  You can get some CO2 less than that but can't get it low enough to recoup the cost of the machine I don't think.  it IS a space saver though if you're a heavy user of fizzy beverage products.  If I exchange one CO2 cartridge while the other still has some charge then I basically never run out yet only have two bottles taking space in the fridge.  Plus I'm not going through a ton of disposable bottles.  That's worth something I guess.",3.0,0

"When I put on this paracord survival bracelet, I thought that it was a bit confusing how I should attach it to my wrist. I figured out that I had to put the black rod through the metal eyeknife. Then, I had to tighten the black metal rod to make the bracelet cinch shut. I liked the weave on the bracelet, it looked pretty. I chose the green and black bracelet. I like it better than the black only bracelet. When I wore the bracelet, I felt that it was a bit chunky. This is probably a good thing, because it means that there is a lot of rope for whatever I'll need to do with it in emergency situations. Some possibilities might be to make a trap or to stop bleeding. The compass was nice, but when I used it, it didn't seem to point to north all the time. I turned the bracelet 180 degrees, but the arrow didn't point in the same direction each time. The eyeknife is sharp so you have to be careful when you are wearing it and if you get too close to someone else. I was a little afraid when I was putting it on that I might cut myself.

"This chair is comfortable and sturdy when assembled and I am happy with the purchase.  HOWEVER, be advised that assembly was difficult.  I timed it, and it took me 2 hours to put this together and it required two people...the reason for that being that instead of the screws coming loose in a plastic bag like you would expect, this chair has the screws actually screwed in place on the unassembled pieces. I've never seen this before, but it's vexing.  So when putting this chair together, I had to first unscrew the screws that were VERY tightly held in place before I could put the arms on the chair and then rescrew the screws.

The bulk of assembly time was spent on unscrewing the screws -- it felt like an Olympic bodybuilder or a cyborg had tightened these things.  I ended up having to use a flathead screw driver and a wrench to get the screws off (I affixed the wrench to the screwdriver handle to give myself some extra torque and it was the only way I was able to get the screws off).

After that, I required a second person to hold the pieces together as I rescrewed everything together.

You need a lot of patience to be able to take these screws off, folks.  If you are not a patient person, then you should probably look for a chair that has the screws come loose in a plastic bag (the way Ikea does).

I think the price on this chair is great.  The leather is beautiful and so comfortable.  I'm actually sitting in the chair right now and it's giving me great back support.

I would rank this 5 stars if not for the fact it came with all the screws very tightly affixed and all the frustration that caused me.  I bought this chair for $80 but similar ones I saw at Target and other stores were around $125 or so --- so I feel like even with the frustration it was a great value.",4.0,0

"This is a nice travel portfolio. It's a good size  - about 6 inches wide by 9 inches tall and a good 2 inches deep with room for more if you don't mind it bulging a bit. You can sling it over your shoulder or strap it to your belt like a Renaissance Faire pouch.

It has all kinds of compartments. In the back are a zippered pouch running the full length of the thing (about 7 inches from where the zipper is placed) and another zipped pouch gives access to the back of the flap, where you could stash some cash or change or a credit card or two if you want to keep them in a less obvious place.

The front opens up two ways - from the bottom up and from the right like a book. If you flip up the top flap there is a small pocket in front and access to the main pouch. If you open it up from the right (via a Velcro strap)  you have slots for credit cards and ID (five slots total, one see-thru), a place to slip a pen, and three other assorted pouches on the right side.

"So all my life I've been cooking with wooden spoons so I don't ding up the metal pots (nylon spoons warp and melt - hate them). I'm also a dishwasher kind of gal, hate doing dishes by hand. When I found out that these wooden spoons can go straight in the dishwasher I was like ""is that even possible?!"" In addition, I have the Epicurean cutting boards and love them (also stick them in the dishwasher!). So we got these Epicurean spoons and I'm ready to throw all other cooking utensils away. I'm so glad they come as a pack of 3 because I use them daily when cooking. I'm also the type of gal that leaves a spoon in a pot and walks away to do another task in the kitchen (I ruin a lot of good spatulas that way); these spoons can withhold the high heats while left in the pan.

There are 3 different utensils it comes with. My fiance loves the flat straight edge one for cooking ground beef to separate the meat. I equally love the small and large spoon. The smaller spoon is like your typical thought of a wooden spoon and the large spoon is large but still usable like the smaller spoon, I use them interchangeably. The great news is they don't change the flavor or my cooking or retain any smells/flavors (I also sniff my dishes when they come out the dishwasher).

I think I'm going to get everyone this for Christmas. You don't have to cook with your momma's wooden spoons now! Great for dishwasher fans or a change to the typical wooden spoon.",5.0,0

"I had originally posted a pretty scathing review because of my dissatisfaction with this product. Kooltek promptly contacted me both by replaying here and by e-mail, and offered me a full refund and said that I could keep the cooler. I promised that if I kept it, I would try the product again on another computer I have that is an exact duplicate of the one I first installed it on.

I just got time to do that this weekend, so here is my revised review.

Pros - Cooler installs fairly easily with no modifications to the motherboard. Fan has a cool blue LED.

Cons - Performance is mediocre. I'm not sure it cools any better than my stock cooler, but it does so quieter since it uses a 120 mm fan running at less than half the speed of the small fan on the stock cooler.

I'm using this on an ASUS motherboard with an AM3+ socket. Unlike some coolers, I didn't have to chance the mount and backing plate to install this one. But the mount is cumbersome, requiring you to get fingers down into spots that can be tight to push down on the spring clips.

I wonder if the heat sink compound that came with the cooler is of good quality? I had terrible results with the first installation when I used it, but on the second installation I used some compound that I had purchased awhile back. It seems of better quality.

It does seem to be performing better than the first time, but not as well as I would have hoped. Another cooler I paid only $10 more for dramatically outperforms this one, though it is much harder to install, requiring removing and replacing the mount and backing plate.

I think this cooler needs further refinement to be a viable product. For now, I recommend paying $10 ore and going with a better product.

But kudos to Kooltek for standing behind their product and going the extra mile to make me happy. That went a long way with me.",3.0,0

"I purchased 5 of these drives to build an 8TB RAID5 array (onboard RAID on the motherboard). They were 2010 vintage drives so the first thing I did was update the firmware on them.

I notified Amazon and they sent out a replacement drive right away. One thing about RAID5 arrays...making changes takes forever. It took a 2 days to initialize my array and 4 days to rebuild it after replacing the failed drive. A week later the RAID management software came up with an error indicating that the replacement drive could not be found. Turns out the SATA connector had come loose. I immediately ordered new SATA cables with the metal clips on the end that lock the connector in place. Overall I'm very happy with these drives.

"I bought this for my wife, who rides a Specialized 26"" Myka disc sport. She was experiencing extreme discomfort in her 'lady parts', her seat bones, and her lower back (probably from bumps in the road).

I searched high and low for a seat that was comfortable, made for a woman, and one that did NOT look like a beach cruiser seat. I found this one and took a chance based on the extremely positive reviews.

With the factory seat, the wife was forced to cut rides short due to discomfort in the above stated areas at maybe one or two miles. The pain remained debilitating for days afterward...keeping her from riding more often than once per week. After waiting just over a month for her to 'acclimate', her pain kept getting worse.

Seat was installed today and we did just over ten miles. I actually planned on stopping after 5, but she insisted on going further...emboldened by the lack of pain and discomfort. Well, several hours after the ride, she is still pain free. Pain free in her back, her seat bones, and her all-important lady parts.

We made a minor adjustment at the 5 mile mark of the ride to tilt the toe of the seat down a little. After that the wifey was in bicycle heaven. Even though we spent a lot of time on broken pavement, and she was running 55psi in her tires, this seat still came through with flying colors.

Now, the last upgrade is a pair of Schwalbe Big Apple HS-430's in 26""x2.35"". Read my review of the 28""x2.35"" that I installed on my Specialized HardRock 29er Disc (hardtail). On pavement, it makes it ride like a full suspension bike with lots of pre-load dailed-in. They are worth EVERY PENNY.

Regardless, this seat works perfectly for my wife and she loves it. She is also not ashamed to be seen riding it (it looks relatively aggressive). Highly recommended for the money.",5.0,0

It's true, they are better than nothing, but they offer no protection against water and very little protection against wind, and are only meagerly insulated; I would feel my hands getting extremely cold after only a few minutes in 35-45 degree weather. I would also call durability into question because the fabric they are made from has started pilling after only a few weeks of use and the strap holding the retaining clasp on one of the gloves snapped right off while pulling them out of my back pocket. Again, these gloves are certainly better than nothing, but are near useless if used around water, snow, or ice, and are certainly not useful for use around freezing temperatures. These are almost certainly more suitable for use a a liner for a heavier glove or mitten than as a standalone unit and I would recommend using it as such.",3.0,0

I can now bring lip balm, gum, energy gels, house keys, etc. without weighing down my pockets. The holder is very light but is constructed well, I think it will last quite a while. The fit is easy to customize with Velcro holders, which are very sturdy. I rinse the bottles and wash the caps every time I use it and let them air dry completely before storing.

"This was my first time wrapping handlebars myself.  As other reviewers said, it's fairly forgiving for a beginner.  I'm pretty happy with the end result.  I ended up having a little trouble getting the ends right.  I wasn't able to fold the end of the tape neatly into the bar ends and fit the plug in as is intended.  I managed to fold some of it in and then wedge the plugs in, but I ended up having to trim the ends of the tape a bit in doing, so it wasn't very neat in the end.  I wrapped a little electrical tape there to hold things together, so it should stay and doesn't look too bad.  It's similarly a little tricky to get the other end neat: ideally you wrap it all up, then do a diagonal cut across the tape so it lines up, then finish it nicely with the little strip of electrical tape provided.  I'm not sufficiently dextrous/skilled to do this: instead the cut was a bit messy and I used a little extra electrical tape to cover it up.

I'm sure a professional would have done a neater job of that, but it looks fine and normal electrical tape covering up the messy ends!

Second, the mount did not fit Optoma HD131Xe.  I played around with different configuration options, and finally had to bend one of the arms, and put some holes in another, just to make it fit.

Third, the sliding arm design is very poor.  There is very limited range of adjustment (15 degrees according to the manual, but more like 10 degrees), and adjustment screws are very hard to reach.

"The Problem:
Samsung Galaxy Tab comes with ridiculously short charging cable.

The Solution:
Juiced Systems Extra Long Charging Cable.

I've received this dual charging cable as well as the Juiced Systems standard extra long Galaxy Tab cable and they are both great.  With this dual Galaxy Tab & Micro USB cable, I can charge both my Tab Plus 7.0 and Galaxy Nexus phone at the same time with just one cable.  This will be my go-to travel cable.

Juiced Systems also really supports their products and customers.  They were extremely responsive to email questions and when I had a small issue with one of the initial cables I received, and they sent me a replacement cable almost instantly.  Can't say enough good things about their customer service.

So if you have a Galaxy Tablet, this is the solution you should look to.

"I purchased the Olympus VN 6200PC years ago, so I decided to compare it with the newer Olympus VN-722PC.

At the time of purchase, I paid $43 for the VN 6200PC (I have no idea why its now listed for $144.99). The VN-722PC is currently $53.47. So it costs a little more than the original charge for the VN 6200PC. What do I get for the added price?

The VN-722PC is slightly bigger with a LED screen that is almost double the size of my old recorder. This makes it easier to read all of the settings.

Both have lightweight plastic cases but seem sturdy enough to weather the roughhousing usage of the average person.

In addition to the Menu button, the VN-722PC has a round scroll wheel that makes navigating between the settings easy. My old recorder has similar buttons but instead of round, it has a square scroll wheel.

The VN-722PC has a speaker that is about double the size of the other and it is placed on the face of the unit rather than the back like with the VN 6200PC. Plus the sound coming out of the larger speaker is nice and crisp.

The newer VN-722PC has a MicroSD slot. This would be very helpful in situations where you must do a lot of recording - such as at a convention. This way you can bring along extra cards and not worry if your recorder will have enough memory to record everything.

Format
My old recorder captures recordings in the Windows Media Audio (WMA) file format. This isn't good for me since I am a Mac person. I always had to convert the recordings before listening to them on my Mac. Whereas the newer VN-722PC saved my recording as an MP3 file - no converting needed. Yeah!!!

Manual
I found the included manual adequate to get you started, but I went to the Olympus (American) website and downloaded the more thorough digital manual.

Final thoughts
The two things that really tipped the scale in favor of the newer VN-722PC were the MicroSD slot and the saving as MP3.",5.0,0

"If you're not familiar, freeze-dried food comes in sealed envelopes (such as in this boxed set) or #10 cans. Out of the package, they are powder or dry chunks of freeze-dried food, which simply means that all of the water has been removed through a special cold process. Freeze-dried foods are prepared for mealtime by the addition of water (usually boiling), and it takes about 15 minutes to prepare a single meal. Broadly, freeze-dried food runs the same quality spectrum as canned or dry boxed foods: Some are quite delicious, while others are only so-so.

Note several important factors: 1. Freeze-dried food is very light, so it will be easy to transport, which may matter in an emergency such as a hurricane. 2. Freeze-dried food requires safe drinking water (boiling hot, in most cases) to reconstitute. 3. Freeze-dried food should be used very soon after the packaging is opened. This makes it difficult to split a single package for use now and later. 4. Unopened, freeze-dried foods are good on the shelf for a time measured in years (often greater than 10 years).

This particular product provides 9 sealed envelopes of food: 3 breakfasts and 6 meals for lunch or dinner, for one person. Notice that some of the envelopes include 2 servings, so technically those envelopes could be shared with another person, depending on appetite. The two types of breakfast (eggs with bacon and biscuits with gravy) are tasty, and we've actually eaten these for ordinary, non-emergency, non-camping breakfast at our house (also try this vendor's Breakfast Skillet product: yum!). The lunch and dinner items vary in quality. My suggestion is that a little extra water be used with any meal containing pasta or noodles, and a little extra time be given for the noodles to soften.

The 3-day box makes a convenient package of emergency food for one person (note that this vendor also offers 4- and 5-day boxes). Keep in mind that a source of hot drinking water will be needed to use this product.  Listed allergens include: egg, milk, wheat and soy.",4.0,0

For anyone else looking to do the dual-boot trick, the key is to use the most recent version of Ubuntu (the older versions don't play well with the Windows UEFI boot loader) and make sure you disable the Secure Boot option in your BIOS.  Also, turn off the Fast Startup in Windows 8 if you want to be able to access your Windows partition from Linux, otherwise Windows just hibernates instead of doing a complete shut down.",5.0,0

It has great features and is great for shooting at range.  The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because it was very easy to install.  The included clip does not fit on the case.  This is a bad design and should be fixed.  The next time I shoot, I'll get another one of these for my Shield.  The belt does not come with the clip.  I had to go to the store to get the clip.  I was going to buy a second one for my Shield, but that was not a deal breaker.  It is good for a little practice but not a great purchase.  The clip is not flexible enough to handle the recoil of a gun.  The metal part is very easy to install and the clip is easy to install and remove.

"My experience with the Kestrel 4500NV with ATRAG (and Bluetooth):

1) No indication that Kestral can be updated via flashing the firmware; if there is an ATRAG issue, you could be out of luck

2) The ""Gun Library"" software has recently become available on Horus' website (after missing for most of the year). However, the software does not appear to install correctly. (We've tested it on Windows 7 (64bit) and Windows XP (w/SP3)). The software is supposed to be able to look up factory ammunition loads from a MS Access database that installs with the software.  What you get instead is a ""DSN Driver"" error. So it doesn't appear to work properly.

3) You can finally download the settings, and you can upload them. However, you can not remove all of the guns in the Kestrel. Which is cheesy is you are trying to use the Gun Library to sync them.

4) Customer support on the Horus side seems to include many reports from people with much more time in grade, per se, than myself, of ignoring their customer base.

5) Kestrel, with generally makes great products, has an online support forum system that requires INDIVIDUAL approval of posts made. So, even when you mention something not really negative but without a positive spin on their product, the post doesnt get approved (that's not a good sign)

6) Kestrel has finally upgraded the software on their site to version 1.7, which seems to now work with Windows 7; this was previously not the case.

For a product this expensive, you'd think the software from Horus Vision would actually work properly. It doesn't.

Does the device itself work? It appears to. Has its support software been well vetted, no.

"My wife and I have an historic condo in a circa 1890's building - a truly lovely period place with high ceilings, wide moldings, huge pocket doors, marble fireplaces, wood floors, etc.  it cries out for period-piece furniture and ""atmosphere"" consistent with it's heritage.  We both love candles, but they have their drawbacks, from real flames in an older buidling (not a good combination) to dripping, wick-cleaning, etc.  Nevertheless, they are worth the effort.  When saw these I had to have them.  First, they look EXACTLY like real wax candles - and even kind of feel ""waxy"" (although they are not made of wax). And the electric ""candle"" light is authentic - and can be adjusted from just ""on"" to a ""flickering"" real candle effect.  And, best of all, you get a small remote control that you can use to turn them on, turn them off, and set an automatic timer to keep them on for 4 hours, 8 hours, or 24 hours, after which they will turn off.  They run on inexpensive batteries, which last forever, and put out zero heat - no fire hazard.  And, the look and light and flicking is incredible.

"When I'm seriously tired, this coffee machine infuriates me. Because if I""m tired I forget how particular it is about how you line up the basket. Then I have a hot water  with coffee grounds mess all over my counter top and I have to figure out how to clean that when all I want to do is sit down and drink coffee . Then I use more 4 letter words. Aimed directly at the makers of this piece of crap. I am going to buy a replacement coffee machine and this one is not broken. I have never done that before. I usually just rough it and pray the inferior product just breaks.  But I hate this coffee maker so much. Its like some kind of evil torturing device for the really tired. I'll give it 2 stars instead of one only because it does actually make decent coffee if you line up the coffee basket properly.

"Arrived right on schedule - well packaged - this fan will literally blow you away.  It's somewhat heavy but appears very well made.  Assembly was a snap. I used toggle bolts to mount the bracket to the wall (3/16 x 3"") - I did need to open the holes in the bracket with a 3/16 drill bit - I always use toggle bolts when hanging something on a sheet rock wall and want to make sure the anchors don't loosen up or pull through.  As far as the downward angle - the downward tilt is about 45 degrees maximum - of you are looking for a fan that will tilt down further (like parallel to the floor), this is not the one. Otherwise this is an excellent buy.  The pull string on/off mechanism works very well - changes speed easily - no yanking. The 18"" diameter gives great air movement (not sure how many CFPM).  Checked the big box stores and couldn't find a fan that could compare. One home store carries a wall mounted fan that may be close in size and air movement, but costs over $200.",5.0,0

"UPDATE (3/12/15)
Well if you look below and see Sony's response.... what a lame reply.
I like how the comment is just ""sorry"".....  why wouldn't the organization try to make it right?
Your smart response would have been to say ""email me and I will send you a lens cap"".
Or "" here is what you can buy on Amazon that fits"".
Hey Sony.... now you really blew it....now everyone can see how stinky your ""after purchase"" customer service is.... sheesh, what a joke.
And you can be sure I will share this story with everyone I can......

Original Review:
Well I have had this camera for 1.5 years and have to say it takes amazing pictures.
It's a nice step up from some of the other point/shoot brands and it is a perfect size to grab and take with anywhere.
Fits well into small bags, purses etc

Here is my sole complaint but it is huge one.....
There is zero info on the lens size so finding a replacement lens cap.... has been a nightmare...... sigh!!
I wasted tons of time talking to the ""product experts"" at Sony (they're not very bright about their own products) who cannot find the lens size.
Tried a few camera stores and not had any luck finding a replacement cover b/c the lens is not threaded....
That means I have to order one from Sony, pay their ridiculously high price for a new lens cap.
What a ""post-purchase"" drag this has been!
Lesson leaned.... I will stick with other brands now that have more main stream camera parts so a simple thing like buying a replacement lens cap is not a big hassle......
You've lost all my future business on this Sony.....",2.0,0

"I'm impressed.

As stated, not HD. And no drivers need for Win 8 or Mac Lion.

Good color, good contrast even in rather low light.
Resolution is way better than an X10 and on a par with older Logitech products.

Mine had a 3.5 MM microphone cable attached with the USB, and nothing comes out, I mean nada. (I don't think they say it does come with audio)

The focus ring lets you go down to about 12"" for a sharp (enough) picture.

The LED lighting as a roller switch in the 5' cable to adjust brightness... IT can (a little) adjust brightness. Sorta, if you play.

No idea what the top button is for. I suspect that maybe with some software it will trigger a snapshot.

For the $, over the top 6 stars. If you're travelling order several so if you bust or lose one you can have an instant backup.",5.0,0

"This is my second pair of Brainwavz Angled Memory Foam earpads. The first set I purchased was for a a pair of Audio Technica M50's that I enjoyed, but always found the earpads a bit uncomfortable. The Brainwavz fit perfectly and installed in less than 2 minutes.

The second pair are for a set of HiFiMan HE-400 headphones. It's here that I'm deducting a star. While it is nominally true that it will fit the HiFiMan series of heaphones, the Brainwavz are not an exact fit. First off, the earpads are oval shaped while the HiFiMan uses round circular earpads. Second, the HiFiMan headphone earpads use an inner lock ring on the earpad. This requires you to remove the lock ring and insert it into the Brainwavz earpad. The ring is circular, which requires a great deal of stretching of the Brainwavz earpad. I did pre-stretch it before attempting to insert the lock ring but it is a struggle fitting a circular plastic ring into an oval earpad. I cracked one ring on the first attempt (thank God for duck tape) that I repaired and finally got it in. Having learned from the first, I was able to get the second ring in a bit easier.

As you can see by the photo, they look pretty good once installed. They are a 1000% improvement in comfort from the stock HiFIMan earpads, which are very shallow and cause your ear to rest upon the inner grill cover. The Brainwavz are like to cushy pillows on your ears and more importantly add some distance so your ears are not resting directly on the grill.

From a sound perspective, my HE-400's are a bit airier with the velour pads, but in truth I have not experienced any major sound changes using the new pads.

The Brainwavz are a worthy upgrades for HiFiMan headphone owners. Just be aware of that you have to fit those rings before you can mount the earpads.",4.0,0

A lot of people who have reviewed this talk about the extenders not being attached securely enough.  I would have to assume something has been changed on the rack because mine did have a way to tighten the extenders.  I just installed this and put one of my axiom 45L panniers on it and it fit fine  I put this on my 2009 Surly Travelers Check and it seems to be sturdy I think it would hold a lot more than the listed 45 lbs (Not that you would enjoy steering your bike with anything more than that on it)  This is great for bikes like mine that did not have mid blade fork eyelets.  I would have prefered the steel Surly rack however that was 35 dollars more and the replacement fork for my Travelers Check would have been another 100 dollars.

"I got a Kindle for Christmas and wanted to get a cute, but protective cover for it.  I did a lot of research, and M-Edge seemed to get really high reviews, so I bought one.

I knew this cover wasn't leather (unfortunately), but once I touched it I was disappointed in the feel of it.  Yes it is soft and smooth, but it looks and feels like plastic ""Pleather."" It really does have a bad over, but I was spoiled by leather in the past. No, it's not leather... but I knew that when I bought it, so I can't hold that against it.

Overall, I think the design of this cover is fabulous. I love how it incorporates the E-Luminator (sold separately). It's quite a slick design. I love that I can store the E-Luminator right in the case.  I also love the strap that keeps the book securely closed or open.  It folds back on itself like a dream, and is very comfortable to hold either open or folded back. The inside has a nice microfiber suede-like lining that offers protection against scratches.

"I'm a software developer who recently decided to try out the whole standing desk thing. I hadn't seen many reviews for using the mat for this purpose, which made me hesitant to purchase it at first, but now I'm glad I did.

To get a feel for the usage so far: I don't try to stand the entire day but try to alternate between an hour or so of standing and an hour or so of sitting. It's only a month in, but so far it's held up from regular wear. You can't tell that it's been used at all.

The mat definitely helped with fatigue and back support. I have a few running injuries that normally would make something like this a little painful, but in the month of using the mat, those issues have mostly disappeared.

When I sit, I have a chair that seats as high as the desk is propped up. For the first few weeks I would move the mat under my desk and pull my chair over fear of leaving a dent in the mat. After a well-meaning co-worker sat in my chair for a while it was on the mat, it did leave an impression on the mat, but after removing the chair it sprang right back to the mat's original form.

"I've been using Corsair products for the last 10 years or so, and I've never had one of their products let me down. I've got previous experience with their memory sticks, power supplies, mice, and static pressure fans. None of these products of their that I've used have ever had any issues or have ever stopped working prematurely.

With that in mind, these ML120 RGB PWM fans have been working great for me too. I've installed all three fans, along with the Lighting Node module in a Cooler Master Storm Trooper case set up for front to rear airflow. The fans are PWM speed controlled through the header pins on my Asus motherboard with a custom fan speed curve programmed in specific to the individual properties of each fan and mounting location.

These fans are providing plenty of airflow in the case and only ramp up to higher speeds that become somewhat audible, under more stressful computer loads. The majority of the time they run at reduced RPM's that are virtually inaudible compared to the rest of the ambient room noise. Never once has their airflow become inadequate, not even in an 85F ambient temperature room.

The iCUE software that controls that lighting features of these RGB fans allows them to be set up for a myriad of different color combinations, including dynamically changing colors based on what software is being run or games being played. The software has a small learning curve in order to get the most out of the features, and feature packed it is.

Overall these are excellent fans with more than adequate airflow for my needs, and they add a lot of visual pizazz too. Visitors always stop and comment on the colorful light show these case fans provide.",5.0,0

"I've had a super-cheap yoga mat from TJ Maxx for the last ten years.  I purchased it for a couple of yoga classes I took years back and really haven't used it much since.  If and when I occasionally practice yoga, Pilates or Lotte Berk at home, I just work-out on the carpeted floor.  I ordered this on a whim, thinking it would just be a typical, teeny-tiny thin yoga mat to replace my old one.

But boy, I could not have been more wrong.

This is a high quality, super thick and about 50% longer than a standard yoga mat so it can be used for all manner of floor work.  It's lightweight (for easy portage) but still very supportive.  It rolls out pretty much flat (just one edge maintained a bit of a curl) and is easy to keep rolled up for storage with a convenient Velcro carrying strap that wraps tightly at both ends.  However, I wouldn't recommend it as a substitute for the yoga mat you might typically carry to a class because it's about twelve inches around when rolled.  But it's perfectly suited for home use.

"For the price, they are OK. You have to make some modifications. Consider these, from the factory, as partially assembled correctly. First, you have to grab a pair of pliers and flatten the hoop where all the lines come out the top. If you don't, they get snagged. Hard to describe, but you will know it when you see it. If that doesn't work, I will replace their open-ended keychain style loop with a solid metal circle of some sort (maybe a washer), or put some solder on the end. When the lines do get trapped in there, the sides won't open or close. The springs that open the trap are also weak. You can fix this by removing them, straightening them out to provide more tension, and re-attaching them to the bottom and sides. You can also make the trap better by wrapping the ends of the springs mutliple times around where they attach, rather than the simple ""over once"" method they use at the factory. And lastly, the lines are complete junk. Plan to replacement them with 40-100 lb test line or a stronger string. If you don't, you are lucky to get them in and out of the water a few times.",3.0,0

"I recently lost my Contigo mug like this and started using a random back-up mug I already had laying around the kitchen. After a few days, I noticed that I'd finished my coffee hours earlier than usual every single morning with the back-up mug. Normally I sip on my coffee until it's nearly lunchtime, but now I was finishing it on my morning commute.

The next morning I was thinking about this and realized exactly what the cause was: My Contigo mug kept my coffee so hot that I could not take big gulps of it and it took me until 11 am to get through it. The back-up mug cooled so quickly that I was gulping my coffee by the time I got in the car.

After less than a week I ordered a new Contigo and I will be a customer for life now.

This mug will keep your coffee pipingly, tongue-burningly hot for hours when sealed. Like others have said, I actually leave the lid off for a couple of minutes after I pour and blow on it to bring it down to a drinkable temperature because I know once I seal the lid it's staying that hot. The more of the coffee you drink the more it will start to lose its heat (because you're replacing hot coffee with room-temperature air with every sip, which is cooling the remaining coffee). But the cooling happens slowly enough that the only time the liquid inside of it really gets *cold* is when the cup is less than half full and the snap lid is open, which is letting a lot of air circulate inside the cup. If you leave it full, it will stay *hot*--not warm--for 7 hours.",5.0,0

"This is a great solution for an older Macbook Air.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the front of the cover is a little tight. The case is made of metal and it is not waterproof so it will be hard to hold on to.

I would suggest looking at a larger case for a similar size.

If you are planning to use this case for a new Macbook Air, you should get one with a good screen protector.

UPDATE: I purchased a new version of this case, which I haven't had a chance to use yet.  It is definitely better than the one I purchased.

Update: I was able to use this case to protect my Macbook Air from the lightning strike.  I had a lightning strike with it, and the case was protected by a good screen protector.

"I love this hydration engine, but like a lot of people I hated that it would lose air pressure so quickly. It may not leak water, but its terrible at keeping a good seal on the air chamber! The two 3L hydration engines I ordered couldn't keep air pressure for more than 30 minutes. I'd pump it up, get a strong stream of water, then a half hour later all the air had leaked out and I'd have to repump it. What a pain!

My solution was to replace the o-ring on the air port side with a slightly thicker one, and lube it with a thin coating of vasoline. I also added a tiny bit of vasoline into the power bulb to lubricate the two ball check valves to help keep a better seal.

Now, no more leaks! I can let it sit overnight and it'll still be pressurized.

Also, one thing I've noticed is that they have two different styles of power bulbs. If your power bulb has an air release button then it will likely never seal properly. You need a power bulb with a screw style air release mechanism in order to get a good air seal.",5.0,0

I do not plan on using it in river waters, lakes, etc. since the filters are $89-$99 a pop, unless I have to.  The filters are ten dollars cheaper at Infowars. I will use it in a camping situation. If I should have to use it in a emergency situation and filter outside waters in it, Ill update.

The instructions say to flush the system out twice before using, in which I did. It takes awhile for the water to pass through the filter.

The water is silky almost like drinking distilled water.  There no smells or odd tastes. I drink a lot of water & its nice to drink from a stainless steel tank rather than a plastic Brita or plastic jug, even if it claims to be BPH free.

Instead of using my refrigerators ice cubes, I make my own from the AlexaPure Pro. The ice cubes are clearer and theres no more particles floating in my drinks after the ice melts.

I shouldve bought this a few years ago.

After a few months I took it apart & rinsed it out. A few weeks ago I looked at it & red rust looking marks occurred at the bottom of the top tank which sits in the bottom tank. They were set into 4-5 scratch lines and I though it was rust & I didn't want to use any abrasive on it to make sure. At 1st I thought this thing isn't made of stainless.

The entire system is not inexpensive because the purifier is expensive and the replacement filters seem relatively expensive.

However, the performance is valuable for anyone with allergies. By the time my filters are changed, there is noticeable build-up of particles so I know that this is something that we would be breathing in if not for the purifier.

When I think about what our purifier does, running 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, for 365 days a year, I am appreciative for our cleaner air and decreases allergy reactions. The cost of the filter, changed twice a year, is approximately $0.45/day. For me, and my family, this is a good deal!",5.0,0

"A UHF handheld for under $200, the UHF is a nice little device for the price.

I had a friend who was using the TV and wanted to take it to work with his computer and he was very impressed with the size. This was an excellent purchase.

I was looking at a larger portable player and I had to try it out for myself. I will say I am very pleased with it. I am very pleased with it.

The sound is great. I would highly recommend it.I bought this for my wife to use with her iPad mini and it works great.  She loves it!  She doesn't have a lot of space, but I like it and love it.  I can use it with my iPhone and iPad mini and it does a great job.  It also is a great alternative to a cordless phone.Works perfectly, no problems with the software or even my keyboard. I like the fact that I can switch from the keyboard to the mouse.

I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a portable mouse.

"I went with the 30 minn kota for my 14 ft flat bottom, trying to save a little money. The small motor does decent.... your not going anywhere in a hurry, lol. Also, if it is pretty windy, you are going to struggle, I took this motor to land between the lakes, and tried to use it to move around the main banks on a very windy ""white cap day""...... it worked okay. if your trying to move towards the direction the wind is coming from, you may have some issues. I have used this little motor on 3 different boats, my 14 ft flat bottom, a 12 ft flat bottom we rented (10HP max lake), and a 10 ft v bottom. It works about the same on all 3, the small 10 footer is a heavy boat, maybe even heavier than my 14 ft.

Bottom line, it will do the job. It will move you around coves, or even across small, not so windy channels. BUT.... if you can afford to spend another 65 bucks, just buy the 40 LBS, I can promise you, you will be happier with it. Not saying Im not happy with this small motor, but I do wish I had the extra 10 ft LBS for windy days, or rivers with a swifter current. If you cant afford the other one, or refuse to wait any longer and saye up (like I did.... lol, couldn't wait), buy this one. Like I said, small boats, calm lake, you will get around pretty good. On a river, stronger current, or a windy day.... not so much. Hope this helps someone.",4.0,0

"I love bamboo for cutting on because it's much easier on my knives than regular wood and certainly easier on them than my stainless steel counters. I also love bamboo because it's lighter than regular woods.

This set has 3 boards in convenient sizes. The smallest has a 6"" x 6 1/2"" cutting area (that doesn't include the cut out handle area) and is perfect for cutting lemons, limes, etc. The medium board has an 8 1/4"" x 9 1/2"" cutting area (excluding handle) and the largest board has a 9 1/2"" x 11 1/2"" cutting area (excluding handle area.) All three boards are about 3/8"" thick.

The boards are nicely finished and only require occasional seasoning with food grade mineral oil to keep them from drying out. They look beautiful even left out on the counter but can be easily hung out of the way using the handle cut out.

FYI: studies have proven that wooden boards are much more sanitary than those made of synthetic materials. The wood itself has antimicrobial properties. You can wash these boards in warm, soapy water and dry them - although they should not be put in a dishwasher or in the microwave.

The current price of ~$11 is excellent for the quality of these boards. They aren't like the thick, heavy bamboo cutting blocks that cost $100+, but with appropriate care they should last a number of years.

"We just bought this coffee maker to replace our 15 year old Krups model.  The Krups still works fine, but it was white and various areas were starting to show brown coffee staining. The only feature change we have noticed in 15 years is that now the water comes out in a shower head spread instead of a single drip line.  This model also has a charcoal water filter packet and comes with a permanent gold-tone coffee filter.

We like the looks of this coffee maker and we notice it does not show fingerprints on the plastic coated stainless steel finish.  Some people have commented that their coffee pots drip when they pour and that some lids are hard or impossible to remove for cleaning the lid or the pot.  The pot on this coffee maker does not drip and the lid is easy to remove completely for cleaning.

Finally, we note this coffee maker has a three year manufacturer's warranty.  Hopefully, if ours lasts three years it will also last for fifteen years like our previous Krups.

Update 10/18/13:

After one year of use the lid of our DCC-2650 began to deteriorate.  Apparently the heat and steam from normal brewing caused the clear plastic coating on the lid to begin cracking and crazing.

"I LOVE these. The only reason it isn't five stars is because it is a little smaller than I anticipated.

Unlike some other reusable bags I have, you don't have to fold this a certain way to get it back together. You just wad it up to stuff it back into the flower pocket and pull it tight and it looks as good as when it arrived!

It comes with a small clip if you want to clip it to a backpack, purse, or you can just put them all on one hood by their string to keep them all together when not in use.

They are small and don't take up a lot of room. I always have one in my purse when I go to a festival just in case I decide to make some purchases. I like the different colors, and when you open it, it's just that plain color, but has one stem on it, keeping the rose theme.

It's a great price, so I love throwing one in with a gift etc. Everyone really seems to like them and think they are clever and useful.

As for size, like I said it is much smaller than anticipated. This is definitely not a good bag to take grocery shopping when you plan on trying to stuff as many things as possible into the bag. When I gave one to a friend, she said it was the perfect size for milk. I think getting a whole gallon in here might not be optimal, but it can definitely carry a half gallon easily...

"I am a heavy sleeper looking for an alarm that will wake me up and give me that extra boost in the dark fall and winter mornings.  I have had no prior experience with these types of wake up lights, but decided to give this one a try through the Vine program.  It works for me and I love it.  This sleek, light-weight clock is about 7.5"" in diameter and runs by an electric adapter.  The time and alarm are easy to set with clear picture instructions.  About 30 minutes prior to the alarm time, the light slowly starts coming on, increasing in brightness until the alarm goes off.  To have the best effect, the clock needs to be close to your head, say 1-3 feet.  The light is surprising bright when set to maximum of 10, so bright that I wake up 15 minutes before the alarm goes off.  You can set the brightness to less if you like, but since I am such a snoozer, I leave it at max.  The alarm itself is plenty loud also.  There is a snooze feature, you tap the top for another 9 minutes, but with the bright light, hard to keep sleeping.  It can also be used as a light at night, avoiding clutter on the nightstand.

"With growing pains always on the prowl, my daughter can have trouble sleeping at night. Providing the most comfortable environment for her is the key to getting her to drift off to sleep. Toss in an Autism driven sleep disorder and she has had a struggle. Not having to many options to work with I turned to absolute comfort. That's where Memory Foam Solutions came to the rescue. At the very least despite the setbacks my daughter deserves a wonderful nights sleep. Memory Foam Solutions gives my daughter the extra support she needs to help her not only fall asleep but stay asleep. She wakes up rested and not in the middle of the night either. Sleeping all through the night seems to be the normal at our home and I love it. The foam is outstanding when pressure is applied to it the foam forms around. Then it bounces back like nothing was ever there.

"This little portable router worked perfectly, with the setup minimal.  Only thing missing was a case or pouch to carry it.

I went to Las Vegas recently with my Nexus 7 tablet, which does not have a wired ethernet port.  I also assumed that some of the hotels in Vegas still had wired internet connections in their rooms.  My stay was at the Monte Carlo, which only has the wired connection in the room.  So I plugged cable into this router in the Access Point mode, which in turn sends out wi-fi signals that my Nexus7 picked up.  A couple of tabs on the Nexus7 to accept the hotels terms, etc. and I had internet access.  I was able to check my emails, etc. in my room.  Since the hotel charges you a daily fee which includes Internet access, might as well put it to good use.

So this TP-Link router worked as advertised.  Plug in the required cables, setup was almost automatic, and instant wi-fi connection to the Internet.  The price was great too.",5.0,0

"I had considered the WPi, but the fact that it was a 64 bit drive makes this one a little more affordable. The drive itself is 32 bit, and the MBR is 64 bit. The MBR is in the same format as the Win7 64 bit drive.

"3 months ago the case looked very luxury and looked like a case that would hold up. It hasn't completely fallen apart but there are two problems with it so far.

1. the magnets do not stay in their spot, as if the glue used isn't strong enough. Because of that the magnet moves and sets in between the leatherette.

2. the leatherette is separated because of the magnets. Also on other corners it is separating as well.

Overall I like the case and hope it doesnt fall apart completely anytime soon.

Update (June 15, 2013):

The Magnet at the top has officially feel out of the case. This iPad is used for mixed business and pleasure so it is not really used all the time. I'm the only one that uses it. But from constant opening of the case, it pulls the magnets up, therefore tearing the leatherette more and more. The bottom magnet doesnt stay in the original hole anymore and is pushing its way through the leatherette and plastic. The top you can easily peel back and put the magnet back in place but it comes right back out anyways. Its very frustrating being that the rest of the case is holding up well.",3.0,0

"Pros: 1) It filters tap water. 2) It doesn't leak. 3) Fits in LARGER car cup holders.

Cons: 1) Doesn't fit in standard car cup holders, but it does fit in larger car cup holders. 1) Have to suck REALLY hard through the flip-up straw to get water out. It's a cheek & tongue exerciser for sure. 2) The narrow straw & the amount of required sucking results in decreased water intake. Still thirsty after sucking so damn hard to get a little bit of water. 3) The filter doesn't lock into the plastic casing, so it constantly slips down with gravity, making a seal at the bottom of the bottle so water becomes impassable, so drinker needs to unscrew the cap, reach into the water & reassemble the filter several times a day.

Personal experience: 1) It's easier to suck through the straw by removing the middleman (the flip-up straw on the cap): unscrew the cap, detach top of straw from inner lid, then just suck from the clear colorless straw. The water is still filtered but then I don't have to suck as hard as I do when sucking through the flip-up straw.

2) The bottle doesn't leak UNLESS you accidentally drop it on a hard floor while the straw is flipped up, then the hard plastic straw may crack, including the peg that plugs the air hole. Then it may leak if ever it turns upside down in your bag.

3) I did accidentally drop it on a hard floor while the hard plastic straw was flipped up. The hard plastic flip-up straw shattered, and now it cuts the inside of my lips whenever I drink from it.

4) When it broke, I had just bought it and wasn't feeling like spending another $10 on yet another water bottle, so I've been enduring the sliced lips & hard sucking cheek & tongue workouts & reduced water intake.",1.0,0

- decent cable management
- adjustable position of rear fan
- room for additional front fan
- padding to absorb sound on sides
- removable filters front and bottom

Cons:
- top cover must be left off if using water cooler (ugly --see photo) would prefer a 2 piece cover of some kind
- No fan control
- only 2 usb ports on front
- Should have top cutout for 12v MoBo power (was a stretch)
- Tight fit for water unit near Top hdd cage

I think it would take an h110i (has holes for 140mm mounting, but no grommets), but wouldn't guarantee.  As it is the fans just clear the motherboard and the top 2 drive bays can't be used for full length drives with a h100i installed.

I like that the case allowed all the wiring to be run behind the mobo, but running the 12v cable was a tight fit and pushes up against the RAM slots at the right edge.  It would be nicer if there had been a cutout at the top of the mobo to allow a straight run behind.  Cutting it myself seemed like too much work given that the cable fit as is.",4.0,0

"I ordered this on Amazon Prime Day!  Item was delivered promptly and I regularly cook eggs with runny yolks in this pan.  I did not want to write my review too early until after I had used this pan on a regular basis.  I did stick a post-it note on my range for the family to take note to never put this pan in the dishwasher and to only use PLAIN WATER and a scrubby sponge or paper towel to wash this pan.  The instructions say to not use lemon-based dishwasher detergent to clean it.  I guess I have taken that a step further with only using water to clean it.  Sometimes I have just heated up a little water and then turn the heat off and let it sit.  This has been working and the non-stick surface is still very much intact.  So far, by doing this, it has performed better than any other non-stick pan I have ever owned.  I have not treated my past non-stick pans this way and they have ended up being recycled.  Tonight I cooked chicken breast tenders with MCT oil and garlic and rosemary and they turned out very tasty but f I usually only cook eggs in it.  I am babying this pan and I love it and it is still beautiful!  Never use non-stick spray in a pan like this and the instructions for this warn against using olive oil which I am taking to heart.  Real butter is okay and a little goes a long way!",5.0,0
"I almost gave up on these because I just could not get them on - then I did some reading and found there was a trick to it: Turn the sock inside out almost all of the way so that you can just put your toe in. Put your toes in, align it properly so that your heel will line up with the heel of the sock, and then basically roll it onto your foot bit by bit. I'm a Women's 11 and ordered the large; I thought it was too small for me until I tried this. Turns out they fit well.

These are very well-made, high-quality, strong compression socks; in fact, they're probably the first true compression socks I've used given that I never had to do much to get others on. They are quite comfortable once adjusted right. They are very strictly contoured, so if they aren't sitting just right, they feel off. The grey band over the top of the foot near the ankle seems to want to come to rest right where I flex my ankle, which is very uncomfortable. I find I have to pull this part down towards the toe until it rests on top of my foot rather than in front of my ankle. So if you get these, and you're not used to real compression socks, be prepared to fiddle with them a bit.

They're great for exercise and really do reduce soreness.

"I have had some bad experiences with cheap carabiners in the past, so when I picked up a pair of these, I was pretty skeptical. However, as I opened these up I immediately noticed the quality construction. The gate is firm, easy to use, and is not sloppy at all. In fact, it feels the same as my Black Diamond Neutrino carabiners. The form of the carabiner looks really solid and in fact at a glance looks like something you'd spend good money on at an outfitter. The Favofits are about a centimeter shorter in length than the Black Diamond, and are noticeably thinner. However, I feel very confident using them for their intended purpose, and that is, of course, hanging my hammock. So perhaps you're sacrificing some load bearing capabilities by not buying a proper climbing biner, but what you lose in load capacity, you gain by this carabiner's ultralight weight. Each comes in at well under an ounce and are among the lightest carabiners in the industry. As a backpacker, I truly appreciate that.

In short, worth it for the weight savings, I don't feel like I'm skimping for my needs, and I'd buy again. In fact, my friend is picking up a pair tomorrow. Excellent.

"The previous spoke guard on my bike cracked where it connected to the spokes so I replaced it with this one.  The one that cracked was the original spoke guard that was on the bike when I bought it over 10 years ago.  It's not surprising that it would crack after putting a lot of miles on the bike, and over the years I suspect that this kind of material might become more fragile.  This replacement part seemed like the same style/quality/size (hard plastic) as the original, so I thought I would have no issue with it for several years.  Unfortunately, it broke at the spokes the same as the original one after only a few weeks and way fewer than 100 miles.  When I realized that it was loose, I noticed that all three places where it connected to the spokes where broken and it was spinning freely.  I don't know if all three cracked at the same time or if one cracked and the rest gave way because it couldn't handle it on only two connection points.  I don't think there is anything wrong with the derailleur or wheel or size of this guard that is causing this issue-- the bike works just fine and I've noticed no difference in my ride recently and this product fit perfectly on my spokes.  I bought two of these since they were cheap, so I will put on the second one now (or just leave it off and take my chances), but I honestly thought that I would lose/misplace the second one before I ever needed it because I thought it would be 10 years+ before I would need it.",2.0,0

"Great for line-tending when watching ice divers!!! The divers in the water are always clipped to a thick line but a person needs to be holding that line to send 'pull signals', to pull them back, etc. The problem is that ice diving occurs in water just above freezing, definite winter conditions above the water. Wearing normal winter ski gloves doesn't work because they soak through with water as you grab the line; these don't get wet on the inside unless you let water run into them from the opening (hard to do, these have really long wrist areas and you don't tend to raise your hands up high too much while line-tending). Hands stayed warm from the fleecy material inside (I tested them at approximately -10F).

I admit I was disappointed in these gloves out of the box because the seams had rough edges where they were fused together - but as long as you're not rubbing delicate skin (or something) with the outside of the glove, it isn't a problem at all.

I also tried these for summer kayaking in Alaska because my hands always got cold from the cool water. Wearing these gloves was too hot. Sweat made them soaking wet inside since they don't breathe.

I laughed my head off that anyone would try these for Alaskan winters (aurora viewing/vacation). These won't help you at -40 temperatures. Buy real ski gloves (hopefully with a palm big enough to allow you to ball your hands up into a fist for finger warmth if needed) or mittens (the thick kind with waterproof covers).",5.0,0

"So I like big desks with lots of spots to organize your things on. My wife hated my previous desk, which was big with lots of organizing space. She thought it was ugly, but it was the only desk I could find that suited my needs in that exact way. Then I found a desk set that wowed both me and my wife. This credenza made a great extension of that desk set.

It's a simple design, but that belies the great functional details and style this desk offers you. The desk top is a good size with a nice slick finish that will make the room you have it in look better just by being there. The desk has some heft to it, but not so much where you cannot move it around. On top of the desk is a central opening with a cover for cables to come through. Under the desk is a nice cable management system going all across the center of the back board that ends next to holes in the side boards for you to run cable without hitting the ground. All in all a nice way to organize your cords.

The desk is not made of solid wood. If it were I would be worried as good solid wood furniture doesn't come cheap. What you do have is a nice, thick, layered particle board desk that is a good deal sturdier than what you normally find. Installation is pretty easy, but it is tedious if you don't have power tools. A Philips head screwdriver and maybe a hammer is all you need.

This credenza was used as an extension for a larger desk set I put together. You can do the same as this particular collection is very customizable. As a basic desk all on its own it makes for a good, solid worktable. I would recommend a hutch from the same collection to get the most out of it.",5.0,0

"If you need a basic no frills stereo receiver, this is the way to go.  As a bonus it has a phono input for a turntable.  The Sherwood sounds at least as good as my Sony STR-DG720 in stereo mode and is probably more powerful.  I use this receiver with an HDTV, cd changer, and turntable.

I purchased a second Sherwood RX-4109 for about $90 with tax from electronics expo a couple of months ago.  I notice a very quiet hum from the speakers when the receiver is powered up and no signal is sent.  Once I press play on the CD player the hum disappears and can only be heard at extreme low volume.  It does not bother me as this is not my primary listening system.  The first receiver from Sherwood I purchased probably does the same thing, I just newer noticed.

"I only gave this 4 stars because of the installation struggle I had with the post installation. Putting in on the mobo wasn't that bad at all (I had to take it out, but it was fine.) The problem I had (and might have could prevented) was putting the usb connecters and 4-pin connector on the board which were all underneath the fan.

It fits nice in My Lanbox Lite with just enough room between my fan and the PSU. I was originally gettting the Blue Orb II, but on the day my item was suppose to be delivered, I got an email from Amazon stating that the item was out of stock and they had to refund me.

Anyway, the fan looks, sounds, and cools ALOT better that the stock intel fan that I originally had there. I have a Intel Core 2 Quad Q6600. With Stock, temps were 44c idle, as high as mid 60s load. With this, 36 idle, 50 load. I call that improvement considering the noise difference.

Edit: After further use, I used the 2 60mm fans that are placced the the inside to the outside of the vents to suck out the heat that lingers in that area (most likely due to the heat coming off of the cpu and out of the PSU that is DIRECTLY above the CPU fan. The temperature is now around the same temperature as the stock, but MUCH quieter, especially with my fan controller.",4.0,0

The oil comes out in a line, I wish there was a way to make it have more of a spray but the oil does come out very easily. So I used the olive oil as a pot coating like a cooking spray.

No more bags.  I have only had to buy a replacement filter once since buying it over 2 years ago.

I vacuumed the house before sending the other vacuum back.  Then immediately vacuumed the house again: it looked as though I never vacuumed it with the other vacuum; the lint bucket was full.

"Great kit for the money - similar priced items on Amazon and in stores are junk and prone to stripped threads and broken plastic. This is a solidly crafted set of pistol cleaning tools, with all-metal rod and slotted tips, and an actual metal bushing in the plastic handle. Avoid the others in this price range (including the Hoppes branded ones); the all-plastic handles will crack and the plastic slotted tips will break.

THIS KIT DOES INCLUDE 22, 32, AND 44 CALIBER.

For some reason, the item description on Amazon and the packaging of the item don't mention this, but instead states ""5 calibers"" lists 38, 357, and 9mm as separate calibers... it has two bronze brushes, a cotton swab, and a slotted tip for 22cal. It does NOT have a bronze brush for a 32, but does have a designated cotton swab and slotted tip. It has a dual-purpose 44/45 bronze brush, 44/45 cotton swab, and slotted tip.

CALIBERS:
-22 family (223/5.56, 22 Short, 22lr, 22 Jet, 22wmr, etc)
-32 family (32acp, 32sw short/long, .327mag, etc)
-9mm family (38spl, 357mag, .380acp, 38 super, 9mm para/luger, 357sig, etc)
-40 family (40sw, 10mm Auto, etc)
-44/45 families (44spl, 44mag, 45acp, 45lc, 45-70, 45gap, etc)

PROS:
- Almost all metal parts (rod, brushes, tips)
- Plastic handle is made to last, has metal bushing (these typically break first)
- Small durable case, easy to stow in range bag, sturdy clasps

CONS:
- Lacks 32cal bronze brush, but has two 22cal bronze brushes?
- Rod is short, and may not be suitable for 8""+ barrels
- Difficult to remove some parts from case (handle)

4/5 stars because it really ought to have a 22 and a 32 bronze brush, rather than two 22 bronze brushes.

First timers, remember to buy lubricant and a barrel solvent/cleaner, and be sure it won't harm your polymer framed handgun! Hoppes is good but there are many other brands that work well.

"Brand new, the Spaulding 64-497 Official NBA Zi/O Excel indoor/outdoor basketball looks slick, and feels great in your hands.  The synthetic leather is very tacky, allowing someone with a medium sized hand, to palm the ball.  Along with a nice grip, the foam backing underneath gives the ball a cushiony feel, allowing for excellent control when dribbling.  This ball would be a very terrific choice for indoors , as the cushioning seems to make for a ball that is very responsive and lively.

With a softer outer layer, this ball doesnt fare quite as well outdoors.  Depending on the type of playing surface (concrete, asphalt), the ball can be a little less lively when dribbling.  Being sticky, it attracts dirt, and dust, and soon loses its tacky feel.  And playing on a hoop that has a steel net, probably isn't very healthy for the composite surface.

In conclusion, the Zi/O ball feels great, and would be ideal on an indoor court.  It can certainly be used outdoors, it probably won't hold up very well long term, under the more rugged conditions.  My choice for outdoors is&nbsp;, which is quite tough and very durable, Wilsons NCAA Indoor/Outdoor Tackified Synthetic Leather is also great, but seems to no longer be available.",4.0,0

"I can't tell you how much I love these tips! I haven't even experimented with all of them yet, but I love the ones I have played with. One thing to know - some tips require a stiffer frosting and some less stiff. It seems the ones with the little round holes need to be less stiff because if it's too firm, it won't come out of those tiny holes. The best advice I can give you is to wrap your frosting in some plastic wrap, snip off the end, and place that open end down into the bag inside the frosting bag, nestled in the frosting tip. That way, you can change frosting colors simply by taking that plastic wrapped frosting out of your bag and put in a new one, without the big mess of washing out all your bags and tips. Using a frosting coupler inside the bag and having the Russian tip on the outside of the bag helps too, so it's easy to switch out tips! I hope these handy tips help you! Have fun!",5.0,0
"For a backpacking treat these are pretty good. I'm not positive what happened with other reviewers' packages, but mine tasted exactly like cheesecake. Maybe my wife has a subpar recipe and I've never been the wiser...

In any case, took these on a 14 mile hike and ate them halfway through. All 3 guys that had them liked them. Even my lactose intolerant buddy wanted more!

They are a little more dry and crunchy than anticipated, but once you chew on it for a while it gets better. My buddy suggested eating them with coffee, luckily I had brought some in my Tribe bottle. They were not as good with coffee and made it even more weird because they just floated and never took in any of the liquid! They tasted like strawberry more than lemon & lime until we read the ingredients.

I had them folded up and stuffed into my backpack and some of the cubes lost their graham cracker crust, but most was retained. To be honest the graham cracker dust was awesome with the last few cubes of cheesecake.

So to that end, are these great for prepping? Likely not - i'd rate them a 3 or 4 out of 10 for emergency rations. However, for backpacking i'd give them a hard 8 of 10 - especially when you've got a hard/long hike.  They are small (take up little space), light (weigh next to nothing), and taste good.",4.0,0

"This case is lightweight, feels good in the hands, and installation is as easy as described; just push the iPad gently into the inside and listen for the snaps.  Thats about all the good I can actually think of for this product, however.

This case's advertising is very, very misleading.  The description states that it provides a ""secure closure"" to the iPad for the auto wake and sleep functionality.  What it actually does is lay limp and lifeless across the face of the iPad like a drunkard on the floor at the end of a Christmas party, doing no one any real good whatsoever.  When I read ""secure closure,"" I thought that it meant that there were magnets in the corners of the cover that would provide a secure closure of the cover to the face of the iPad and actually protect the screen from scratches while traveling, like almost all iPad portfolio type cases provide.  I was sorely mistaken.

If you just want a cheap, lightweight yet relatively good looking case for your iPad Air, then sure it will probably make you very happy.  If your looking for a case that will actually do what it promises to do and actually provide a secure closure of the lid to the screen of the iPad, then no, this case will make you very angry and, given that the lid does not provide secure closure, this does not bode well for the iPad.

"My wife is very particular about ""her things"", and when her tea kettle was starting to rust out, she hinted that she would like a new one for her birthday.  So I found this highly reviewed kettle on Amazon and thought it a good deal for many years of service.  When my wife received it for her birthday, she was not completely satisfied, but over the past two months she has ""gotten used to it"".  Here are her complaints:

1. Difficulty getting water into it.
  - with my wife's old kettle, she filled it through the spout.  The spout on this kettle is a bit narrower than her old one, so at first water would spill down the side and get the outside wet.  She also tried to use the filling lid on top, but the lid has tight tolerances (so steam doesn't escape or rattle around), and the handle doesn't move, so there is no clear path to the pot without getting the outside wet.

2. Difficulty eating water out of it.
  - as you can see from the picture, the spout protrudes from the upper quarter of the pot.  This means she has to hold the kettle at an almost 90 degree angle to pour her hot water, and dousing her hand with a good bit of hot steam.  With filling the kettle a bit fuller than she is used to, we are able to get around that problem.

Now that she's had two months of kettle ownership, she is much better at aiming water into the kettle, and doesn't have so many problems.  She has also noticed that with the flatter and wider bottom of the new kettle, it does heat faster, and it is easier to clean with the nice enameled finish.  However, I think next time that we need a new kettle, I'm just going to install a hot water dispenser at the sink.",3.0,0

"Denons ear-bud headphones are simple, comfortable to wear, and offer high sound quality.

The Denons are understated, but stylish.  They have polished end caps, with dark chrome accents.  The materials and the fit and finish are high.  Included with the headphones are three silicon ear tips; small, medium, and large.  Also included is a short extension cable, although I am unsure what anyone would need it for.  I never needed it when using the Denons with my iPhone 5s.

The Denons have a small built-in microphone and a single button that is attached a couple of inches down from the right ear-bud.  The button allows you to control music playback and take calls/use voice command.  Its very intuitive and simple to use.

Sound quality of the Denons is high.  I listened to all types of music, from jazz, to country, to pop and all of it sounded nice.  Bass was strong without being overpowering, and high were also nicely rendered.  Overall, I found they produced very balanced and attractive sound.  Since the Denons close off the opening of the ear canal so well I was also able to hear subtle instruments and vocals that I would have missed otherwise.  The one downside of their excellent noise isolation is that I could also hear myself breathing at times.

The Denons are comfortable and I found that the medium sized ear tips fit my average sized ears best.  The headphones fit snuggly, but are never uncomfortable, and even after walking briskly for a mile they only shifted a little bit.  Im not sure they are made for running, but for modest activity levels they should work fine.  They are also light in weight.  The cord is long enough to not tug on the headphones when you move, but not so long that it gets in the way.

"As others have said, they are a bit tinny, however, for my relatively simple needs, they're fine. I got them to replace an old pair of speakers for my desktop. They're even adequate for music for non-serious listeners, but the bass, as has been said, almost disappears. I also wanted something relatively small, due to limited desktop space, and these certainly are---the other speakers certainly weren't huge, but these really do give me some extra space. Lastly, as has also been said, the instructions talk about two cables, a green and a pink, which is usually for input with a microphone. However, there's only the green cable, which is fine. Plug it into the input jack, plug the normal size power cord into an outlet, and you're good to go. (The fact that it's a standard 2 prong plug, rather than a large brick like my old speakers, was a further bonus. )

"My initial review of this was very positive. We like these very much. But my daughter started developing a rash above her lip where the bottle was touching. She has done this with other metal bottles without issue, even with her metal sensitivity. But these bottles must have a high nickel content or something because she is very clearly reacting to them. Now I have to send her to school with this bottle AND a stainless steel straw so she can drink from them. Ugh. I wish we had figured it out sooner. We would have returned them.  My original review is below in case you don't have a metal issue and want to know more about the product:

Easy to clean, easy to open. They have a smaller opening than many of our bottles which is nice, too. No problem with the tops in the dishwasher either (most of our other bottle tops have to be hand washed). So we are very pleased with these and bought several more after trying them out.",2.0,0

"Was hoping to get a decent cup of coffee from this machine but was disappointed. Major problem is that the water is not heated sufficiently when the coffee is brewed to deliver a hot cup of coffee when the brewing process stops. As cold tap water temperatures are somewhat cooler out of the tap in the winter I tried slightly preheating the water before placing it in the coffeemaker...no major improvement. Temperature of coffee in pot immediately after being brewed about 145 degrees.

What's interesting is that the coffee did indeed get hotter after sitting on the heating element than it was after it initially brewed. Unfortunately, we like to drink coffee immediately after it has been brewed not 30 minutes or an hour later. Our old Braun coffee pot delivered much hotter coffee.

A few minor points include the area where you pour water into the coffeemaker being a little smaller than expected,and the need to move the brew water delivery arm back and forth.

This coffee maker was bought as one of a few small things that we put under our Christmas tree to give ourselves so the 30 day return period to Amazon has past otherwise it would go back.",2.0,0

"For a summer overnight backpacking trip, I decided to get a nice backpack but a cheap sleeping bag.  This turned out to be a good decision.

Pros:
1. This bag is soft and silky to the touch.  I wore warm clothing to sleep and was able to move about against the slick fabric.
2. The ""loft"" of this sleeping bag was lightweight yet warm.  It was better than expected.  The temperature in the mountain hut where I slept was probably about 55 degrees.  I also had a blanket on top.  For a summer camp trip, this bag was fine.
3. The bag was long enough.  I am 5'10"".
4. The bag isn't a mummy shape, which I like.

Cons:
1. This sleeping bag is narrow.  I slept with it folded over but not zipped.  It is several inches more narrow than husband's bag (but also lighter).
2. The zippers at the base corner of the bag seem to be two different zippers that leave a little gap.  Not a big deal for my situation.  But if I wanted a warmer situation, I think I'd rather have one big zipper or some kind of overlap.
3. Putting the bag back into the pouch is laborious.  I ended up putting the bag directly into my backpack's sleeping bag compartment, which was no problem.  I used the stuff bag for my fleece sweater instead.  This stuff sack is good if you really want your sleeping bag tiny.  But if you want ease of use, it's a bit more work than necessary.

Overall I feel this bag is a good deal for the low cost.  Eventually I will invest in a lightweight, warm bag.  But for now, I feel I got a good value on a bag that will be used on occasion.",4.0,0

"I have several stashes (office, home, car, storage locker) of emergency rations and several 'bug-out' bags as I cannot be certain where I'll be if and when the poop hits the propeller. I have had to re-order this item on several occasions to replenish my office stash as I keep snacking on the darn things. Several Points:
1) The 'brick' is aluminized plastic vacuum wrapped around 18 individually wrapped bars. 2) The brick is heavier than you would expect as the moisture content is very low to allow a tightly packed food source in minimal space. 3) Due to the low moisture content you will want a liquid to drink although the bars themselves DO NOT enhance thirst. 4) Once the outer wrapper has been breached, the 5 year shelf life is no longer applicable. The individual bars are wrapped in ultra thin cellophane. 5) The 18 separate bars TOTAL 3600 calories. The Three day calculation is bases on 1,200 calories per day (3 meals a day for 3 days at 2 bars per meal). 6) For those of you who rightly observe that 1,200 calories per day is below the prescribed minimum. keep in mind these bars are coast guard approved emergency rations. They are MISSION SPECIFIC. I. E. : They were designed for the relatively low caloric consumption of sitting, inactive, in a life boat while awaiting rescue. That fact, however, does not diminsh the wisdom of having a supply on hand for emergencies and/or bug-out ration suppliments. One Complaint: as I mentioned before, they use a thin cellophane wrap on each bar (no doubt to further minimize bulk of packaging). The problem is that it is a B*TCH to unwrap. If you do it wrong, the bar will crumble. My technique is to sliide the side of a pocket knife around the flat side of the bar (Much like you were honing the knife on a whet stone) until the edge of the knife catches the edge of the wrapper and then gently work the wrapper off.",5.0,0

"Installed this in a split level 1960's era home that has a combination of old 2 wire (non grounded) wiring, and remodeled sections with 3 wire (grounded) wiring. Router is upstairs, and I wanted to hook up an ""Apple TV"", and TiVo downstairs using the Powerline XE104 to cut down on wireless signals that were interfering with my LG Home Theater System's wireless rear speakers and subwoofer (caused annoying sound fade in and out).
  Wiring involved was all in 2 wire part of the house, but on a different circuits. Was able to get an immediate ""downstream"" signal and internet connection going through a 6 outlet (wall) surge protector at the Router end, but only got .5 Mbps throughput speeds downstream (testing speed with laptop and online speed test). Removed the surge protector (as Instructions state), and speed went up to same speed as when the laptop is directly connected to my Netgear (Wireless N) Router. This product is rated at 85 Mbps, but obviously not getting that from my ISP (15 Mbps max.). No need to get Netgear's faster products (200 or 500 Mbps) if you're not getting a lot more than 85 Mbps input from your ISP, right?
  Movie streaming speed to Apple TV is good. Will probably connect the LG BluRay player up too (which can also stream Netflix or Vudu movies wirelessly) once I get a longer Ethernet cable (now using Wireless N with good results).
  One other note: Those that are saying they get two 4 port units must be getting re-packaged or a mis-packaged Kit, as Netgear's specs for the ""XEB1004-100NAS  4-port Powerline 85 Adapter Kit"" specifically states one unit has one ethernet port, and only the receiving unit has 4 ports.

"I should have trusted the poor reviews that I read here.  Many reviews mention that this thing just stops working after a few weeks.  Well, add me to the list - this was fantastic for about 100 shots.  Really great concept.  Sure enough picked it up on day #27, fired 4 shots, then  no-worky -  it stopped lighting up altogether.  When I opened it up, could press the battery down and make it light - but will not light when the cap is on no matter how hard I press the little rubber stopper.

Changed batteries - no go.  Tried putting in a paper insulator as shown by one customer here - DON'T DO THAT!!!! with one layer of paper inside, you cannot remove the batteries again - no way to get them out.

Thank goodness for Amazon returns - this thing is going back right now....  I'll have to try Surestrike or other competing product instead.  But buyer beware - I have not seen a product yet with REALLY good reviews.  Seems like they must all be using cheap $6 Chinese laser pointers and charging $90 as a ""laser cartridge"".  Shame on you, Laserlyte - for the $90 I paid, I deserved more than 100 shots.  Won't buy from them again.

Maybe duct taping my $6 laser pointer to my barrel, and just watching it for movement during my trigger pull will be adequate enough? I'll give it a try.

"I'm giving this 5 stars, even though I clearly received a different color than the one in the product image. The product is described as and pictured as *black with gold"", but I received blue with gold. and it's still lovely. I've attached a couple of closeups below, where you can clearly see the royal blue against the gold. The teacup arrives in an almost impenetrable fortress of styrofoam and bubblewrap. You could drop it off the roof and it would be fine. The porcelain is almost unbearably delicate. I was worried my hamfists would shatter it just by moving it around to take the photos. The teacup is the most delicate piece. When you hold it up to the light, you can see a translucence---it's really lovely. The gold trim is very attractive. My set actually has more gold trim than pictured in the product images. Specifically, my teacup has a handle that is almost entirely gold, and the small teaspoon actually has some gold detailing at the end of the handle. (See photos. )

I only have a single place setting right now, and I imagine that the confusion over color (black vs blue) might make it more difficult to buy 3 more settings without concern.

"These JBL Stereo Headphones (ear buds, really) have brought music back to my ears.  Since losing most of the hearing in one ear (and about 20% in the other), my experience of music was drastically altered.  Stereo became an aberrant mono, movement became stuck in place, and range became unpleasantly narrow.  Amazingly, these headphones compensate for much of that, and music sounds rich and clean once more.  I cannot explain the acoustics that make this happen, but I am thoroughly surprised by and appreciative of it.  (The first music I listened to was a pre-hearing loss favorite  Van Morrisons Poetic Champions Compose.  The alto and soprano saxophones have reclaimed their divinity.)  The rated frequency response is 10  22K hertz.  The buds are comfortable and fit securely; I did not need to use the optional silicone tips.

"Nice magnifier for the price.  I looked at 3 brands when shopping.  Eotech , Vortex and Sightmark.  The Eotech is great but it is way out of my price range.  The sightmarks action to move it out of the way felt cheap and was not very fluid.  The Vortex went on sale for 159 which was a bargain.  The VMX-3T flips out of the way with a simple button movement.  Can easily be done on the fly one handed.  I like the way it feels.  The magnifier is very clear and works great when paired with a Eotech 512.  It comes with a hight spacer so that you can raise it a smidge if it is to low.  You can fully adjust where it is pointed through the side and top adjustments (like any scope).

The one down side which I find on all scopes if your eye is not at the right distance it shrinks the field of view.  I did not find this to bad in shooting with it though.

"***UPDATE: December 10th, 2016 - Now that the price dropped to $260, plus $20 rebate, I take back everything I said about the RX 480. Because now, you're essentially paying the same price, for up to 50% more power. The compromise is the increased power draw and electricity bill, but if you're a PC gamer, you don't really care about it too much. Performance is the ultimate goal, and this card delivers in spades. It is the perfect balance of price/performance - $150 cheaper than a GTX 1070, for about 80-90% of the performance. That's amazing.

**UPDATE: August 6th, 2016 - What's even more amazing is that as of right now Amazon is only selling it for $310!**

This is amazing deal, compared to what the other R9 Fury's that are selling on Amazon. It's a little too little, a little too late, as the RX 480's and the the GTX 1060's are already here, with a better price per performance ratio. In a sandbox, an R9 Fury for $350 is a great deal, so that's why I'm giving it give stars. But in the real world, you would be better off to get two Rx 480 4GB's, and only pay $50 more for about 1.5x the performance.

"As my former bugout bag (45L, no frame S&W tactical pack, which I truly love) hath recently runneth over, I was in the market for a larger, molle compatible pack with an internal frame. When I was offered this pack at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion, I jumped at it.

This is my third bag from Gonex, but the first one that doesn't fold up into its  own pocket. I was impressed with the heavy duty 900D nylon and the quality construction throughout. The shoulders, waist belt and back are nicely padded. The molle attachments on top, back and sides allow the bag to be configured in various ways by adding molle compatible pouches, and there are straps on top and bottom for carryig sleeping bags, tents etc.

My favorite features:
- included, attached rain cover (this is in the semi hidden very bottom pocket, zipper next to the lumbar padding). I also like that the rain cover on the desert camo pack is a solid tan. When deployed, the pack looks more 'weekend getaway' and less 'SHTF' with the solid cover.
- pockets in the waist belt. They aren't huge, but will fit small items like a wallet, phone or power bars.
- the zipper runs the full length of the main compartment, giving easy access to everything
- there are 5 pockets on the inside of the main compartment flap; 1 zippered, 2 velcro and 1 open mesh
- 3 position height adjustment
- water bottle/ snack pockets on the sides
- molle attachments everywhere!

My minor quibble:
- the lining and cover are a slightly different color (more yellow) than the tan in the camo. Not a huge deal, but I would have liked it to match.

"I got this item on Thanksgiving/Black Friday this year with a sale they were having, so for the sale price of $64 it was a great deal.  I had gone back and forth for a while about whether I was going to switch to this type of coffee maker from my traditional 4 cup coffee pot I had used for years, mainly due to the expense and the taste of some of the pods.  I ordered the filter/pod assembly where you can use your own coffee grinds as well (figured that would save on expense). One thing I did decide to do (which I am glad about) is to get this model because it has the water reservoir that holds quite a bit of extra water.  I am really happy about that.  The coffee maker came quickly and I have used it now for about a month.  It took some trial and error with the grinds and the type to use in the filter but I finally have that down pretty good.  I ended up looking for my favorite brand of pods as well that were on sale, so most of the time I use the filter and my own coffee, but then every few cups I go with a pod.  That saves some money too.  I do think this whole style of coffee maker uses way more coffee than the normal brewer, however that being said - the convenience of the one cup and how hot it comes out, I actually don't think I would ever go back to the traditional pot, and that is saying a lot - because like I said I fought this switch for a while.  All in all I am extremely happy with this product and am glad I bought it and switched over.",5.0,0
I chose this radio because it has the best picture quality I can find for a compact radio. It is so small that it is not portable and takes up very little space. I used this radio to record music on my Canon Rebel T2i. This radio is excellent. The sound quality is excellent. I have also used it to record music on my Samsung Galaxy S4. I will say that I have never had a problem with the radio. I have a Canon Rebel T2i and have never had any problems with the sound quality. I am not an audiophile so I have never been an audiophile.

They are very easy to clean, its like the cookies just slide off of these, I pick them up one side and they just slide off of the mat and onto your platter or others. I mean you can actually just wipe the sheets off with a cloth, I know that may sound silly but I don't ""wash"" these per say I am just worried that soap would be a little harsh for these kinds of baking mats so I just use really hot as my hands can stand water and scrub them with a wash cloth. I really love these baking mats they are great for anything that you are cooking. Oh cheese who hates baking cheese onto things? I know that I do!

"I purchased this to audit my office wireless network and it was well worth every penny. Using the Alfa AWUS036H I was able to decrypt our 128-bit WEP key within 45 minutes on the first attempt, and a mere 20 on the second attempt. I knew WEP was insecure, but even though the AP was set to use MAC address filtering and no broadcast SSID, I was able to collect enough information to decrypt the WEP key and authenticate to the network. Needless to say, the office wireless has since been upgraded with an access point that supports WPA-PSK2 with AES. WEP offers little to no security, and this device can help you prove that to anyone making purchasing decisions, or even to yourself if you're a skeptic.

The Alfa AWUS036H is also good to carry around if you travel a lot and need the extra power and range (hotel wireless networks typically have a high noise threshold) to get a more stable signal. I use it with a 6 ft. USB extension cable to find the best location for signal reception. This device provides better reception than wireless adapters costing several dollars more and is an indispensable tool for wireless security auditing, I highly recommend it.

"This mat was delivered quickly and seemed to work well for me at first. I did slip some, which I'm not sure you can ever NOT slip because let's face it, sweat is slippery. So I purchased the chalk-like non-slip material recommended by the manufacturer and have been using this and have been quite satisfied with the tackiness overall. Without that, I'm sure slipperiness would still be an issue for me in a heated yoga class. Yesterday I was very annoyed to notice, after only having the mat for a month and a half, this mat is already starting to tear, which seems to be the norm with more general, less expensive mats such as these. I am very disappointed to have spent the money on this and having this happen already! I practice yoga typically just once/week but sometimes twice, but this mat never gets used for anything other than yoga. If I'm doing other exercises requiring a mat, I use my old cheap mat purchased at a popular local retail store that is crumbling in a similar manner as this one. I just flip that one over and use the other side for sit ups, planks, etc. I was considering more costly mats when I purchased this one, but it got such overall great reviews that I decided to be a little more thrifty on this purchase and took a chance on this mat. I washed it upon arrival just as recommended and am following all the recommendations for care to a ""t"". I don't think an almost $40 yoga mat should be showing wear to this extent this early on.

"I must have been cooking pasta now for the past 20 years, and I have always boil the water in a big pot and cook it that way. I had no idea something like this even existed. Cooking with the microwave was a new concept for me, because I only used it to re-heat stuff.

I was very skeptical at first, but based on so many good reviews I had to give it a try. The first time I used the Fasta Pasta The Microwave Cooker the pasta came out fine, but had a small section that was still under cook. Knowing this, I added 30 seconds to the cooking time next time around, and it was perfect the second time I used it.

This saved me so much time, and a lot easier to clean! Wow!

"I first got a Polar H7 to help me maintain my heart rate zones while cycling and get somewhat more accurate calorie counts. It was a headache nearly the entire time I owned it. While I believe owning a heart rate monitor is one of the best things you can buy to help with your fitness, I wouldn't recommend the H7. The TICKR is everything the H7 isn't. It is reliable, connects fast, lets you know it's working (via the lights) and supports both ANT+ and bluetooth, so it's like 2 products in one. Also, the way it connects makes it slightly easier to put on, in my opinion. The H7 would work fine for weeks, then have problems connecting for a few weeks, then be fine again. To get it to connect I'd have to unpair and repair, sometimes repeatedly. It had trouble with my iPhone 5 and iPhone 6, and with multiple apps (polar app, cyclemeter, wahoo app, others). The TICKR connects every time, instantly. I never have to wait for it. In case I'm worried that it isn't connected, the lights let me know it's working. But, I never worry that it isn't connected, because it ALWAYS WORKS. Unlike the H7. My experience with Wahoo support with other products leaves me confident that if I do have issues, they'll help me out quickly and with little fuss. My only gripe is that the strap is a bit less comfortable than the Polar strap. The plastic bit in the back can press directly into your skin, and the HRM itself comes into contact with your skin. It would be nice if the only thing that touched your skin was the soft strap. Oh well, it's still the best HRM you can buy.",5.0,0

"These Small Tortilla Bowls Makers are a Great Alternative to frying Tortillas by Baking them in the Oven. I use regular size corn tortillas and they look Terrific. I found many other uses from all kinds of small Tostadas, and many other Mexican Food Variations to Salads and even Desserts. My Favorite is making Individual Apple Pies with Pastry Dough, you don't even have to oil or spray the Tortilla Bowls, the butter in the Pie Dough takes care of that, I Bake Eight at a time, the two sets I ordered it, a little bit of work but is worth it!

First I Blind Bake the Dough lightly to create a Crisper Crust until they turn a little Golden, Chill, and spoon the Apple Filling that I already made, I sprinkle with Streusel Crumb Topping and back in the oven to take care of the Topping. I also make my version of the Eclair Dessert with Vanilla or Chocolate Sugar-Free Fat-Free Instant Pudding, also with Pastry Pie Dough instead of Graham Crackers, I Blind Bake them, Chill, carefully spoon the Pudding inside after the Pudding sets I topped them with a chocolate Glaze, and the second time I made them I used Whipped Cream on Top.

"I love the new Antidote reservoirs by Camelbak. I've used several generations of Camelbak's ""mil spec"" reservoirs both while I was in the military and just for hiking and camping. I've also used several other brands' hydration pouches to less than satisfactory results. Camelbak has improved on the their already great design though. These new reservoirs are light weight, open and close easily with just a quarter turn of the cap to lock it in place, have insulated hoses, have protected bite valves and an on/off switch at both ends of the hose so water doesn't spill when disconnecting any pieces while the reservoir is full. The new ones also have like a spine down the middle of the reservoir so it holds a shape to make filling and dropping into a pack easier. I've never been able to burst one either. Neither throwing the pack, nor having other packs stacked on my own, or dropping it down to someone from the top of a cliff or just by sitting on it because it's more comfortable than rocks have destroyed any of the half dozen or so reservoirs I've owned.

This is the short model, its short and wide instead of tall and thin but still holds the max 100 oz.

"I'm a photojournalist and bought this monitor after my old 21"" CRT died. I've been very pleased with the HP W2408H over the last couple of weeks, but it does need calibration. If you are a gamer or general user, you will love the brilliant picture straight out of the box. For photographers and editors, the colors are too bright and saturated, too ""juicy"" for critical use.

I uninstalled the monitor's software, dragged out my venerable $100 Pantone ColorVision ColorPlus (the consumer colorimeter sensor for monitors) and it gave me a nice, clean image in minutes. A worthwhile investment for anyone.

The monitor's wide-screen real estate makes editing hundreds of photos quite a bit easier than with the old square CRT. It also uses less power and produces less heat than a CRT, a nice plus these days. The image is smooth, even and neutral with calibration. Like any LCD, though, you do need to view the screen ""on axis.""

Just to verify what others have said, the built-in speakers are total garbage: weak, tinny, and pointed out the rear so you cannot hear what little sound they do produce. You definitely need external speakers.

"I have the DisplayPort to DVI AmazonBasics cable and the Displayport to HDMI. Both work great. I would suggest either one depending on whether you need DVI or HDMI on the output or monitor side.

"I bought this for using as a hydration pouch but decided that in that purpose, it was far inferior to the Camelbak Antidote. The zip opening and closure is not as secure as I would like the opening of a big bag of water to be inside a pack while moving around. It's also kind of awkward to fill from a spigot, sink faucet or bottle. The drink port is a bit awkward to use as well but its fine I guess. The bag itself seems sturdy enough and not likely to crack or puncture easily.

However, after setting it aside as a hydration bag, I decided to use this as a component in a gravity water filter, (one that I cobbled together with some extra tubing and fittings and the Sawyer Mini filter, but imitating the Platypus Gravity Works) specifically as the dirty water bag. The big zip top makes filling the bag from a natural source like a river or stream extremely easy and the handle thing on top with some paracord or long Nite Ize gear ties makes it easy to hang the bladder from a tree. For that purpose I give it 4 stars, only wishing that it was bigger than 3L to filter water for more than 1 person at a time at stops or in camp.",3.0,0

"The big question is: ""How does it compare to paracord?""  My situation is that paracord is just too bulky for my uses.  I'm aware of the advantages, which are the inner strands that can be used for fishing line, sewing thread, etc.  And for those applications, I continue to carry a little paracord.  BUT the spectra speargun line has become my primary use line for tarps, and tying large and/or unexpected things to my motorcycle.  This line is rated at the same strength as paracord, but is much thinner, which equates to far less bulk and weight for the same length.  Now, an argument can be made for cost.  Yes, paracord is much cheaper.  But for me, I just need a little paracord, and 30 feet of this, and I'm good to go.  I feel that Spectra is extremely durable, so I don't expect to need to buy more in the near future.  Now, one might wonder: ""If he is so concerned about bulk, why not buy some really thin nylon string?""  Well, I did... and it worked great for a single use.  Doing anything other than rolling it back up on the dispenser, or around a board, etc., results in massive spiderwebs, knots, and tangles.  I'm trying to be a green guy, so I try to avoid single use things.  And now, the final question:  ""This is speargun line.  Why is this guy talking about backpacking, motorcycles, and camping (bushcraft)?""

"Synopsis
-------
I bought this board in June 09. I was so busy in Summer that I didn't touch it until January '10. I hit the wall with my run and Nordic Track Ski Machine no longer 'shock' my body. Having stuck in the house during winter months doesn't do good to the body either. Hence, I was gaining a bit of weight. I put this board behind my couch facing the TV and ever since then - I was hooked. It took me about 4-5 days to start getting a hang of it(I never skate board or roller blade before). I held on to the back of the couch during those 4-5 days to prevent any falls from happening. Effect
----
After 2 weeks, I am close to going back to my weight in Summer. My waist is trimmed again; I wake up to sore gluts and core muscles - the best feeling ever! I am now a believer in this equipment and will use it a lot more throughout the year. Activities

I golf and hike in the Sierras a lot; both activities require a lot of core strength(especially when you start getting tired during the round or long hike). I started doing some core exercises about a year ago and noticed some improvements in both activities; more controlled golf swing and better posture during long hikes. I believe that this machine will strengthen my core more as I keep using it. Customer Service

Since it's made of plastic, the edges don't sit perfectly flat when I had them laid out on my table to figure out how I wanted to hang them.

This is how all folding chairs should be made. You get four commercial grade heavy-duty chairs that look like they will last a lifetime. They are constructed from high-density polyethylene and have a powder coated steel frame. This allows the chairs to handle a sitting 400 pound person or a 300 pound person that is standing on it. I can tell right after unpacking them that they will be able to take a beating from heavy usage. They have contoured seats and backs. I noticed that they are so much more comfortable then the common all-metal folding chairs. I have sat in the Cosco chairs for over an hour with zero issues and I could have sat longer if I needed to.,5.0,0

"Spent a lot of time researching a not too expensive case for a Mosin M44 and an SKS.  Decided on this one and it has a ton of room; in fact added a VZ58 in the main compartment.  It is heavy but works, if I were lugging it around on my back I limit it to two rifles max,  but there is plenty of room.  No problems with quality, appears well made.  The hook & loop (velcro) straps in each rifle compartment are good and secure up to two rifles but recommend a gun sock on one or both as you cannot keep them from bumping without an additional two hook and loop straps which would require you to modify.
Shipping was quick and as quoted, however the box it came in was huge; you could literally pack an adult in it, so you know your case will arrive undamaged. :)

"I don't know why I never thought of this before!  How convenient is it to have your mat carrying sling double as your strap?  This will be great for taking my outdoor yoga class at the farmers market.  I don't like to bring props with me but sometimes I wish I had a strap with me to get a deeper stretch - Im just not as flexible as those college girls! As a sling I love that it is so adjustable.  It will fit all of my mats no matter how thick, and sometimes I like to roll my blanket up in my mat when I go, so that makes them too thick for my cheap elastic slings.  Its easy to use as a sling, although it doesnt feel like the straps cinch too tight around the mat when I put it on.  They are plenty tight when Im carrying it though.

It is nice and sturdy as a strap too.  Its easy to unloop the carrying loops to convert it into a strap.  There are included instructions on how to convert it, but I didn't really understand them so I just fiddled around until I found something that worked.  I prefer straps with d-rings like this, and I found it to be a great length for a strap.  It seems nice and sturdy.  It doesnt slip through my hand and feels really supportive for my stretches.  Also a nice bonus - I like the color a lot.  It even matches my favorite yoga mat!  Im very happy with this strap/sling!

"Potentially good earphones with two major issues. I can rate them 2.5 to 3 stars based on the units I received.
First of all, the construction quality is really good. Buttons, earbuds, cables, eartips - everything is made of very good quality. The aluminium case is another pleasant bonus.
Speaking of sound quality, it's good but not great. I felt the bass is weak even after tweaking equalizer on my laptop as well as phone. Audio (especially music) feels little flat as compared to other earphones I tested. Having said that, it doesn't mean it's bad and is surely acceptable for daily use. The volume controls operate individually (independent of source volume) so that's a very good feature. Range is very good. I didn't notice audio breaking while walking away from source unless I went too far. As compared to other earphones I've tested, these have larger bluetooth range.
Two major issues these earphones have are battery life and in-ear fit. In-ear fit is not quite good. It keeps falling off the ears even after trying all eartips and earfins. I found mid-sized eartips better fitting than others. It's certainly manageable when you are doing a desk top and not moving around much. They fell off once when I was walking around in office. Battery life is the biggest disappointment. The earphones get fully charged in less than 2 hours (as is the case with most of other earphones) but I got ""battery level medium"" audio prompt within first half hour of use. I used then for another 40 minutes and I got ""battery low"" prompt and within few minutes they switched off as battery was completely off. So I could use them for less than 1.5 hours after fully charging them. I'm not sure if the battery issue is by design or if the units I received have this defect.
Conclusion - These earphones surely have potential but aforementioned two major issues disappoint you. If they at least had good battery life, they surely deserve 4.5 stars.",3.0,0

This medium feels like an XS, and I had to squeeze my way in there. If I would have gotten a large it may have fit much better.

CONS:
- Doesn't offer backup guide overlay like other cameras (dont know how useful it is, but would be nice to have the option)
- Doesn't offer multiple view angles like the Alpine units
- The curve of the lens seems to let water drops build up more when it gets wet which blocks and blurs the image.

"I bought this bag used via craigslist at a third of the cost of new for my wife who is 5' 1"" for 'anger management'.  I tried to use the unit also myself (GLOVES are a MUST).
I am 5'10"" 200+ pounds. I over-filled the unit over the recommended 270# with 280# of sand. I added 2 gallons of water also from an old milk container. Each gallon adds 8.3# to the container. (Sand has plently of air-space for water to fill!)
I made the mistake of buying eight 40# bags of sand (which was moist) from wal-mart and it took 2 hours to get the sand into the unit via a large mouth funnel. The sand kept sticking to the funnel and I had to push it through by hand. If you fill unit with sand, make sure your sand has been washed and DRIED! Lowes hardware has VERY good 50# white dried-playsand.
The unit has a 'cap/plug' in the top of the unit which looks like it would un-screw. Trust me... it does NOT. It is fused-molded into unit.
I ended up cutting a 1 1/2"" threaded PVC female adapter into the top of the unit in place of the molded cap, and used two-part epoxy to 'glue' to the unit. I then used 1 1/2"" plug to seal top.
I ended up buying 100#s more of sand. This time DRIED! Went in through the top in 5 minutes.
I then added 2-more gallons-of-water to the sand. Giving my boxing set-up 430+ pounds of weight. (including all the plastic)
Note* I would not use this unit on a second floor room. The weight will shake the floor. (Apartment people take note)I have had to move to first floor! (NOT FUN! A good Dolly a MUST at point it is filled with sand)

2) If you don't use it everyday or even occasionally just from going home from work and coming back, the silver piece (metal diaphragm vibrating at an ultrasonic frequency) at the top of the humidifier gets ""stuck"" and I have to kind of poke at it to get it running or shake the bottle up.

"There is something to these Himalayan salt lamps. This is the second one I have purchased. When I purchased the first one, I wasn't expecting anything but a cute night light. We normally keep them on all day, until we go to bed. The first thing we noticed was that is seems to attract our pups. They've never tried to eat it or anything crazy. They just want to lay next to it, usually with their heads very close to it. Then I noticed my husband turned it on as soon as he got home every evening. He isn't into hokey gimmicks that may or may not have healing powers or whatever. I'm convinced that there is SOMETHING to this rock! We call them our Zen Rocks :) Maybe the amber glow is relaxing, maybe it's more. When they are not turned on, the pups don't spend much time on that side of our couch. When they aren't on, I keep thinking, I need to get off my lazy behind and turn them on, like they're calling for me ;) I LOVE OUR ZEN ROCKS!

In comparison with the other one I purchased, the color is pretty much the same. They both have a wood base and you insert the bulb into the bottom. They are both a bit oddly shaped and imperfect, which I love. This lamp doesn't have a simple on or off switch. You can turn it all the way on or only light it dimly. The reason I didn't give this lamp five stars is because it arrived in a squished box. I kept my finger crossed, but my heart sunk when I realized that the switch had a big crack in it.

It does, but the little hair tie looking things that come with it to size it are too different. The smallest one is tiny while the next size up is nearly four times the circumference. If I put the smaller one one it squeezes my head and make my forehead look purple, if I use the next size up it constantly slips down my head and lets sweat through (although less than a saturated Halo did).

"These are great patches they wipe well and pretty much fit any caliber.  I use them on my AR.  However... DO NOT pinch too much fabric into the ring as it WILL get stuck in your barrel. This happened to me (twice ) I embarrassingly admit.  First timer I took to a gun smith and he poked it out with a rifle rod.  The 2nd I just stepped on the otis cord and PULLED my heart out.

They say you can use each cloth 6 times but if you have a dirty barrel it's more like 3-4... the inserts get opened up and lose integrity and it makes it easy for the patch to break and again... get stuck (happened as well) but I used a rifle rod to push it out.

I've since become a master of these patches and have used over 65....  meaning I've done about 3 times the swipes or like 200 swipes through my rifles.

I recommend the smaller 2 inch patches as they are less likely to get stuck but these are still great.  I always pinch close to the inserts and never use a flimsy patch.

"I love this thing! What an amazingly simple concept. It is really nothing more than a big mason jar with a stainless steel infuser, but it works perfectly and makes it possible to enjoy totally individualized iced tea or coffee. The stainless steel filter is made of super fine mesh. It is smooth and relatively easy to clean. Coffee does get between the double screen and you cannot get it out, but, to me, that's no big deal. I am going to buy one for friends and family who love iced coffee as much as I do. My only suggestion: create cute lids. Colors, wood covers or designs would only enhance this already great product.",5.0,0
"I've only used this a few times, and I like it, but it has some idiosyncrasies.  The sizing is such that it probably fits a man better than a woman.  I""m 5'11"" with a 34 DDD chest and even with all the straps as tight as they can go, it's a little loose on me in places.  The straps run over my breasts which I find a little weird and was probably not intentional, as I think the fit is more for a man.  It's the perfect size storage-wise, fitting all the things I take with me (keys, cell phone, etc).  The pockets on the front are nice to have.  The water bladder is a good size if you won't be out too long.  I have a Camelback that's 2.0 liters I prefer if I'm out longer than an hour or two.  I would recommend it for an average to large man but I don't see how it would properly fit an average size woman.  I received this product at a discount in exchange for my review.",4.0,0

"I've bought 3 of these cables. The 1st one was to replace a $230 50ft hdmi cable that was sold to me by the company that I bought a projector from. Someone tried to swap devices and broke the head of the expensive cable, so I bought one of these to replace it and it worked every bit as good as the expensive cable.

When we set up our 2nd theater room, I just went with this cable again.

I have noticed that some blu-ray players work better than others as do projectors/tvs as far as sending/receiving signals over longer distances. The cable doesn't seem to make that much difference - So I'd go with this cheaper cable and still feel safe that it will work for you.

PROS:
The price is great.
The cable is well made and thick
Performs every bit as good as the expensive cables.

CONS:
I did have one cable break that I used in a mobile set up. The cable got a short after repeated set ups and take downs - as long as you don't plan on moving the cable around a lot after it is in place you shouldn't have any problems. The cable was broken when an inexperienced person coiled the cable up after use and folded the neck of the cable next to the head at a 90 degree angle (tightly wound) the cable still works but I have to ""jiggle"" it a little to get the connection to work correctly...
(Not the cables fault - but thought I'd mention in case you plan on using in a mobile set up)

Side note:
Sometimes if the tv or projector is turned on after the dvd player or whatever is sending the signal, I've gotten a no signal message. If I turn the projector on first or turn the dvd player off then back on the signal is picked up. Not sure if this has anything to do with the cable but didn't have that small problem with the expensive cable.",5.0,0

"The presentation of this towel really does not do justice to the product. What turns out to be a remarkably good towel arrived looking at first glance like a small lightweight and inexpensive item, but upon using this product, I discovered a VERY absorbent yet lightweight towel and hand towel set. At first glance this set, (I will mainly address the bath towel) looked rather small and lacked volume compared to the average folded towel, but that turns out to be an advantage. My initial disappointment turned to intrigue as I unfolded the generously sized towel, a soft, lightweight and attractive looking bath sheet. What truly amazed me though, is how I could fold the towel down to such a small size that it would easily fit in a suitcase pocket. My next test was to use it after washing my hair. I was amazed at how absorbent it was, drawing excess water from my hair without becoming water logged. The fact that it also dried quickly sealed the deal--this is my new travel towel!

However, the auto-off function is a deal breaker, so this is going back.

"Stop your search for a bike light and just buy this one. It's perfect. Previously, I had been using two headlights at once (a Planet Bike 2 Watt Blaze and a Bell Lumina) which works good but with the Cygolite you only need one light and it's totally worth the $80.. The brightest setting is actually too bright. I can't imagine a situation where you would need a light that bright. When you turn on the light it defaults to the second brightest setting which makes sense because this is the one you'll use when it's totally dark. As the sun comes up I switch to the next lowest setting. The flashing mode is great for dawn and dusk but be warned it's quite bright and you may severely annoy approaching motorists (which isn't necessarily a bad thing). To change levels you just click the big (and only) button conveniently located on the top of the light. To turn the light on or off you just hold this button down. The mount on this light is fantastic. I much prefer the thumb screw that this uses as opposed to the mount other lights use. In fact that was a selling point for me on this light and it's why I chose it over the NiteRider MiNewt 350. You can get the light on the bike nice and tight. Another nice feature is that the light can tilt up or down. This light is rechargeable which is the way to go. As long as you always have have a full charge you know you'll have a bright light. But make sure you charge it regularly because when it runs out of juice it shuts off. The battery is also simple to remove.  The light feels solid and it's withstood a light rain. I'm going to buy another mount so that I can use this light on more than one bike.",5.0,0

"I love this bag.  No, seriously, I don't mean I like it.  I mean I am kind of emotionally attached to it.  It's the feeling you get from relying on a tool that is perfectly made.

Despite being pretty small to look at, this bag holds everything.  The main pocket is an ok size and can fit everything that needs to go in there -- 1 L water bottle, bike lock, keys, light jacket, wallet, phone.  The pannier pockets are enormous when unfolded and can fit everything I can throw at them.  3 L water bladder?  Sure, with plenty of room to spare.  Groceries, including a few bunches of flowers?  Yep, no big deal.  Plus there's a convenient handle on the top to tote it around.

Here is what I managed to fit in the bag on a recent shopping trip:
4 heads of cauliflower (!!), 6 bananas, 2 18-oz jars of jelly, 1 1-kilogram canister of yogurt, 1 1-lb jar of peanut butter, 1 1-lb loaf of bread, 1 1-lb bottle of vinegar, 1 1-lb box of spaghetti, ~2 lbs of brussel sprouts, 1 20 oz water bottle

The Topeak system is great and means I never have to worry about the bag falling off, no matter how rugged the pavement is, or mess around with bungee cords.

If I were to have any complaint about this bag at all, it's that it doesn't have a thing on the back that's designed for a bike light to attach to.  I've clipped my light to the cord in the back and used one of the clip things on the bag to stabilize it and it's fine, but it doesn't have a designed placement that keeps the light from bouncing out of position and not facing perfectly back.  But that's a super minor complaint about what is really a fantastic bag.",5.0,0

"This makes a truly excellent cup of coffee or espresso - for one person. Probably you can't make a better cup given a particular roast of bean.  I just think it should be bigger.  We like strong coffee and a nice big cup of it. We make two big cups of coffee and we basically have to repeat the whole process twice. And if you have more people, well, I have other things to do with my day, just get out the old dripper I guess. If they made one twice as big I think it would be a huge improvement.

The key insight of this coffee maker is to use lots of coffee, let it soak in the water, and above all, do NOT get the water so hot. 160 or 170 degrees - you won't get the bitterness and off tastes as with hotter water. Now, using this insight, I have been able to use a drip basket instead of the Aeropress in a pinch, and get about the same quality a beverage. A lot of filter baskets taken out of drip machines have a little valve on the bottom so the coffee only drips out when a coffee pot is underneath. You can just put the filter and coffee and the not-too-hot water into this filter basket, and wait a couple minutes, then release the valve and let the coffee drain into a cup. Same quality as you get with an Aeropress, and it just proves that the not-too-hot water soak method is the key.

Frankly as they are not making a bigger model of this I think I will get a French Press. Use not-so-hot water, and make as much coffee as you need without going through the motions 2, 3, 4 times. I think the only problem with that is that a French Press does not have as fine a filter as the Aeropress and you will need to use a coarser grind of coffee or end up with a lot more sediment in your cup.",3.0,0

"These are excellent, high-quality pedals and I can highly recommend them. I have used these for about 4 weeks now and am very satisfied so far. The product feels solid and heavy, and I doubt they will break easily.

Some of the other reviews here have mentioned that they are kind of stiff. Some even recommend adjusting the bearing tightness in the pedals. I do not agree with this and actually would advise against it. To do this, you pop open the little plastic dust-covers, potentially breaking them and letting in more dirt in the long run. Yes the pedals are kind of stiff when they are brand new, but after 4 weeks of riding mine have significantly improved now. I would say ride them for about 50-60 miles and they should loosen up.

One negative point, the black paint/coating on my left pedal is already coming off. This is just a cosmetic issue, but don't expect them to stay solid black for too long.",5.0,0

"I purchased this right after Christmas to use with my new iPhone.  It may be me and my klutziness, but it took me a while to position this in my ear so that it will not move or fall out.  Once you get accustomed to that, the piece is light and comfortable and easy to operate.  The sound quality is excellent and everyone tells me that my voice is ""as clear as a bell"" when I use this piece.  It's SIMPLE to set up and the controls, volume adjustment, etc, for me, have been a cinch.  Less meaningful to me is appearance, but it does look cool.  It has a sleek design and is not obtrusive.  I sometimes wear it all day and, unlike other headsets I've owned, is doesn't get ""heavy"" or uncomfortable.  Sometimes, I'm not even aware that it is on my ear.  This is my third Plantronics headpiece and I've had good luck with everyone of them. I would recommend this headpiece easily.",5.0,0

"Ignoring common sense and warnings on the Web, I bought one of these hand held Dyson DC34 vacuums for about 4 times what I'd pay for a high end competitor's model (e.g. Black and Decker LiIon model). When I got it, I was initially very pleased: Good suction, worked very well. The battery life is short (maybe 6-7 minutes on a charge), but I knew that going in, and that's just part of the package.

Then, after a number of months, the machine began stopping after a few seconds. It wasn't that the battery wasn't charged: I could use it for a few seconds, have it stop, play games with the unit, get it to run for maybe 20-30 second, have it stop, play more games, and so on to get the full 5-6 minutes out of it. But the unit just failed to run continuously for more than a fraction of a minute. I went online and discovered this is a horribly common problem with this model. I contacted Dyson and had them tell me that the unit was out of its (short) warranty and that I'd need to buy another one.

That's not going to happen. Instead, I'll try to warn you all not to waste your money on this machine that, apparently, has design defects. Instead, get a high end (LiION battery) Black & Decker, or similar model for a quarter of the price. It might not be 100% as good as a vacuum, but it's assuredly 90% as good, and in addition, you'll get a much longer lifetime out of it. And when it dies, you can buy another THREE before you're up to the cost of this piece of poorly designed junk.

"The SOG Fatcat that I received, arrived in a dirty, worn looking presentation box, and the knife had multiple scratches on the bolsters and ornamental metalwork (despite the protective plastic films). At $362. 19 delivered, this is fairly outrageous. I sent it back the very next day. If the Fatcat I received is a NIB (New In Box) knife, then it was carelessly assembled at the factory, without regard to scratching up the bolsters and ornamental metalwork. Honestly, this thing looked like it had spent time in someone else's pocket, amidst loose change and keys. If the knife did indeed leave the factory that way, it is a major breach of consumer trust to put those protective films over scratched and dinged up metal surfaces. In my considerable years, I have never removed a protective film from a new watch crystal, or cell phone screen, or even a new kitchen faucet, to find it scratched up beneath the protective plastic. I have seen this but once before--on Cold Steel Espada XL knives, where protective plastic films were knowingly and unethically placed over scratched and dinged up bolsters. I sent those knives back as well. Obvious defects aside, the knife is impressive, but overpriced. If you just have to have one, then have at it. But if you pay more than $150. 00 for it, dinged up or otherwise, you've paid too much in my opinion. I have another SOG Knife due to be delivered tomorrow. I can only hope that the dinged up Fatcat I received is an anomaly, and not the norm for this OEM. Over the years I have purchased a dozen Spyderco Knives, and I've never been less than satisfied with any of them. The same can be said for Kershaw. In fact, the $80. 00 Handmade Damascus Folding Knife from Perkin Knives, that arrived the same day this SOG Fatcat did, is both beautiful and ostensibly flawless--at less than 1/4 the price!

"Ok so the trickiest step was step one.
the hardest step was step four
the most annoying step was assembling the drawers.

They said you would need two people to assemble it but i did it by myself. Let me tell you something, if you are stubborn enough or skilled enough or have the right tools you can do just about anything. I didn't have the right tools so i will let you guys decide on whether i am stuborn or skilled.

Assembly took about 2 hours. The piece, once assembled, is very solid. I expect many many years of use from this. The casters are also very nice too and the whole thing rolls with ease even when you add weight.

Why four stars. Well it is a series of small details. Some of the shelf pin holes are too big and the shelf pins just fall out.

I wanted to use it for transmitting TV audio to headphones (via a portable mp3 player with FM receiver).  It works fine when I stand still, but I get noise every time I move around.

"I use this router at the receiving end of a wireless bridge between the two floors of my apartment, and also as a print and file server. I know this unit may be a bit of an overkill for the purpose, but I couldn't find any lower cost alternatives that would provide the same feature set.

I was a bit worried about the speeds I would get through the concrete floor, but the connection to the main router, an Apple Time Capsule, is rock stable at a 866 Mbps signal rate (the signal sits around 47-49 dB against a 92dB noise floor). The connection would stay up for months at a time.

I was pleasantly surprised that the stock firmware supported all the features I needed, but it's still nice to know that I can fall back to Merlin or DD-WRT if I need additional tweaking possibilities or special features. The performance and ease of use of the web GUI has also improved a lot compared to my previous Asus router, a WL500W. Being able to set most configuration items without a reboot is a godsend.

Another nice touch from Asus was providing a discovery utility, that finds the router on the LAN and detects its current IP address, which saved me a lot of time when I was tweaking the IP configuration of the two routers.

I cannot comment on the 2.4 GHz range or behavior, as I only use the router at 5 GHz.

Update (9/17/2014): I was having print server reliability issues with the stock firmware (after a few days the printer stopped printing, even though the router showed it was connected). So I installed DD-WRT, and I'm back to being a perfectly satisfied customer. Aside from the printer trouble, I only had to reboot the router for firmware updates and I never experienced any connection issues whatsoever.",5.0,0
"I love not having to store and pull out a large machine to vacuum seal leftovers now.  I've used it for all kinds of things and I'm really enjoying how little space it takes up in my drawer (along with the charger).  I like that if you accidentally get a bit of liquid sucked into it the cover comes off so you can easily clean it up.  Plus, it's so light that I can begin sealing liquid filled bags upright so I can avoid this most of the time.  My only issue is not knowing when it is running low and I need to charge it.  I'm guessing it will just die on me, but that would be frustrating if I'm in the middle of trying to seal something or many somethings since I usually separate meals into several bags.  We have a super tiny kitchen so I cannot leave the charger out all the time.  An indication of when I need to charge it would definitely change my rating to 5/5.",4.0,0

"I went back and forth on this beam vs other brand balance beams that were $100 less expensive.  Finally decided that I would invest the extra cash and get this beam.

LOVE this beam.  Came in two packages.  Opened both the packages and just dropped the beam into the legs and voila, instant beam.  No assembly required.  VERY sturdy.  My husband who is 6' 4"" and 215 pounds had no problem walking across it.  The beam did not bend.  Obviously, my husband won't be using it daily.  But I wanted to see if it could really support 200+ pounds like claimed.  ( I believe I read 250 lb)  But my 50lb daughter is the primary user.  But like said, no problem supporting him.  So I am pleased that my daughter will be able to use it for a long time.

I love the height of this beam.  Tall enough so you don't feel like it's on the floor and you can practice scoops.  But low enough that you don't get scared to practice new skills.  I also like the option to purchase leg in the future to increase the height.

My son loves to eat his meals and play with toys on this table but it's definitely flawed for the draw-on purpose. It's a soft top table and chair set so it is very easily punctured. It would have been better if it were actually a hard dry erase board surface. During the first use we could see that the markers it came with were actually staining the table after being erased so we might try Expo pens instead. His light weight toys were leaving indentations also (see photos.) Not a good idea to use pens/crayons/pencils unless the paper is under a hard book.

As a project, I laminated all her photos and then we used these magnets to stick them to the fridge.  These were strong enough to hold the one sheet of laminated photo per magnet, which worked out fine for what we needed.  However, if you were to add say two or three sheets of laminated photo, the magnets don't seem to be as strong.  These are not the strongest magnet, but they are not the weakest either.  They can hold up about three to four sheets of unlaminated photos, just to give you and understanding of their strength.

The sound quality is great, and they are really solid in my ears. I've never had them come out or even start to come out. Battery life is pretty solid. My only complaint is a very minor one, and that is that most of the time when I turn them on I get a message saying how much battery life is left, but sometimes the messages doesn't happen. One other thing I would change is that the case that comes with it is big enough for the earbuds and pretty much every accessory and spare part it came with. I would have preferred a more compact case for just the earbuds, as I don't need to carry around the parts that are too small or too large for my ears.

"By far the best MTB purchase I've made all year! Ever since i rode my buddy's Cannondale Jekyll with his Rockshox Reverb dropper post, I've always wanted one of my own. With most dropper posts running around $300+ i could not really afford/justify buying one, being that my bike was only around $900. I did tons of research, read lots of reviews, and ended up stumbling across this dropper.

So far i don't have a single complaint about this post. I've been riding it for about a month and a half now and It actuates very smoothly, quickly, and reliably. The only drawbacks to this post that i can see are the amount of travel it offers (100mm compared to many droppers with 125mm, i personally find 100mm to be plenty), the quality of the button (its not bad, the LEV just has a nicer, ODI compatable one), and the left/right saddle wiggle (which is 100% unnoticeable when riding).

I would suggest the KS eTen to ANYONE looking for a quality dropper post without breaking the bank.

"These are beautifully made pedals with SPD compatible mechanism on one side and a broad flat pedal surface on the other. My son has Shimano pedals on his race bike so I put these on his mountain bike. He uses the same shoes, so these are clearly compatible with the Shimano cleats. The tension setting on these is near the lowest setting compared to about the middle on his Shimano pedals but I think he wants to be able to get out of his mountain bike a bit more readily than his race bike. That said, about medium setting was way to tight in any case. Given he's a kid, perhaps this make sense. An adult would be more likely to be near the medium setting.

These don't rotate freely because of the bearing seals, which is good and bad. It takes just a short time to get used to rotating the pedal to get the right side and my son hasn't complained. The rub isn't noticeable while pedaling, just enough to keep the pedals fixed relative to the cranks while unloaded.

The adjustment was easy and the setting indicator was clear.

Some folks prefer the mechanism on both side so it's easier to get in and out and that makes sense if you are always using cleated shoes. The alternative of regular pedals opens up many wider platformed more grippy standard pedals which are also better pedals if you don't use cleats. So this is a compromise which works well for us.

I bought the Jabra Cruiser 2 speakerphone for my 2007 Ford Freestyle since the cd player has no jack for an auxiliary cable, nor is it Bluetooth capable. I read many reviews of different in-car speakerphones, and decided to go with this one due to the good reviews and to the price. I have to say that the set up is ridiculously easy, or at least, it was easy for me with my iPhone 4S. My phone paired with the Cruiser immediately and it worked well. I turned on the FM transmitter, and it played songs from my phone onto 88.1FM quickly and the sound was great. Then, I called a friend who confirmed that I was coming in loud and clearly through the speakerphone (though I was not driving at the time). However, on the FM frequency, I had to turn up the sound significantly to hear her well.

Pros:
-Easy set up.
-Loud sound on the FM frequency for music from my phone.
-Comes with a in-car charger.
-Callers could hear my voice loud and clear (at least so far).
-The Cruiser announces every function you do, so that is nice, especially when it lets you know that you are paired with your phone, what radio frequency it is using, etc.

Cons:
-The charger wire would be annoying if used while driving due to the fact that it hangs right next to my gear shifter.
-On the FM frequency, I had to turn up the volume significantly to hear the person on the other end of the line.
-Does not turn off automatically. You have to flip the little switch on the side of the box in order to turn it off and on.

Pros
+ Small. As in this sucker will float to the bottom of your bag and you'll forget its there small!
+ It works! You pump air in and your tires get filled with air. What more do you want?
+ gauge seems pretty accurate to me.
+ Cheap!

Cons
- The plastic clip that holds the house to the body of the pump broke the second time I used it.
- How exactly is this a floor pump? Really, there is no way to hold it to the floor while pumping.

"I bought my sg3 brand new about 5/6 yrs ago, it still works like a champ til this day. Played a round this past Saturday.  It doesn't have all the bells and whistles like the newer models, but its accurate, links to the satellite in 1 or 2 mins, gives me carried yardage, hazard yardage (front and carry), distance to middle, front and back of greens, you can use the small joystick to place the pin in appropriate place on green for more accurated pin yardage. It has a score feature, but it takes to long to get to the next hole, so I have this feature turned off. All in all, I LOVE IT, they don't make this model anymore, but I bet the refurbished sg3 is just as good, unless your into color screens, touch screens and other things that slows your game down.  This one gives you what you need, accurate yardage to hazards, lay ups and pin, so all you need is good golf shot.

"I recently purchased this after picking way too many apples.  Knowing I had a lot of peeling ahead, I thought this would be a wonderful solution.
It turned out to be a complete waste of money & time.
The plastic is flimsy, the handle pops off while you are turning it, and the suction cups on the base are weak.
One of their selling points is ""the spring loaded blade peels the apple skin in one continuous motion"", but when the handle keeps popping off that means a lot of stopping & restarting.
They likely did this 'assemble at home' so it would fit into a smaller box.  Would have been well worth it to have a larger box & the handle attached to the peeler so you really could peel in one continuous motion.
The peeler does work...just not very well.  In my opinion, there are others listed here on Amazon that are better constructed and would do a much better job for just a few dollars more.  I did not realize something this simple would require researching before buying but now I know!",1.0,0

It's a thin mat compared to some that I have seen, but it's made of great quality materials and protects my body when I am down on the ground exercising.  It adds just the right amount of support and comfort so I am able to perform my exercises on the hard wood floor without worrying about my knees or back being in pain.  It's made of 1/4"" memory foam and so it's super comfortable when you lay on it.  It provides enough grip to the floor and enough stability to your feet that you won't slip on it.  The mat itself looks really nice.  I bought it in black and it has a nice textured look to it that feels great when you lay on it  There were a few other color choices, but I'm glad I went with the black so you don't see any dirt or sweat on it.  If it does get sweaty, which it usually does, you can just wipe it down with your towel, and then wash it down with a mild soap and hang it to dry, very simple.  The size of the mat itself is about a typical yoga mat I would say, it's long enough for me to stretch out on it and still be off the floor.  It measures 24"" x 72"".  It also comes with a strap that you can put around each side once it's rolled up so you can carry it on your back.",5.0,0

"I purchased these to replace an old set of threaded dumbbell handles with rubber grips that were falling apart. The metal grip on these is a bit rough on the hands but that has been solved with a set of cheap work out gloves. As many other reviewers have stated the plates do begin to loosen over time and due to the lack of a rubber o-ring between the collars and plates and it can be difficult to tighten them down however i simply swapped on the collars from my old dumbbells which did have the o-ring and the plates stay in place better. Another solution i have found to tighten the collars is to rotate the plates in opposite directions which gives you more leverage on the collars and tightens them more securely.

Overall these handles feel solid and do exactly what they are made to do. I give them 4 stars only because of the plates becoming loose but as long as you pay attention to them and make sure they are tight they don't disrupt your workout too much",4.0,0

My sons are constantly measuring pasta, beans, nuts, etc for the protein count based on the serving size. I love the LED display which makes it reading the numbers so easy.  The features are just what we needed as you can: measure in ounces or grams, check the temperature, set a timer and it even has an auto shut off after two minutes of non-use.  The bowl that comes with it is a nice size and we have not needed a larger one yet. Also, maybe you have noticed this but many of the recipes I have been trying from Pinterest and other sites have the ingredients in ounces or grams instead of cups and teaspoons. This scale makes it a breeze to make any recipe.  I highly recommend you try this scale out, we have had it for nearly a month and just love it!",5.0,0

"These grips blow me away. I love the feel of the grip. The grip is awesome. If you want to get a solid grip then this is the one you should go for. I had no issues with this knife.

I also have a very heavy blade with a very sharp edge and it is difficult to get the knife out of the sheath. I hope the knife is a good value for the money. This is a very good quality, and very well made. The only negative is that it is very heavy and you cannot use it as a gun, but it does work as a handgun. I would recommend it for a gun like a Ruger or M&P-15. I have used this for years. I bought the first one for my wife and she loves it. She is a 5'6"" woman and the other one for her daughter.",5.0,1

"This adorable tea ball is both whimsical and well made. The ball is made of durable stainless steel. The handle is in the form of a green tea leaf and is made of food safe silicone. Because the handle is made of silicone, it will not get hot, not matter how hot the water for your brew is. The coordinating silicone drip tray is a very nice piece to set your tea ball on when you remove it from your cup.

This tea ball easily holds a full tablespoonful, which is the amount the major majority of my herbal teas suggest to use for a 1 cup portion. The silicone portion fits snuggly inside the stainless steel ball part, yet is very easy to pull apart. Everything cleans up very easily with soap and water, when washed by hand. I do not have an automatic dishwasher, so I have not washed it in that manner.

I have been very pleased with the quality and performance of this product. I purchased this item at the regular price at which it was offered for personal use.

"Wuliff Tactical Knife with Foldable Blade - 6  Inch Overall Length, Stainless Steel Pocket Knife, Durable Lightweight Design, Secure Locking Mechanism, Rust Resistant, Ultra-Sharp Blade

Exceptional knife, especially for the price!  Even my husband, who collects knives was impressed with this one.  First off, this foldable tactical knife, by Wuliff, shipped fast, and arrived well packaged and in perfect condition.  Knife measures 6.5 inches long by .5 inches by .5 inches, so is a great size for an EDC knife.  Knife is made from stainless steel and is foldable.

The first thing I noticed about this knife, was the design.  It has a nice sleek look to it.  And the handle is comfortable to hold (especially for those, like me, with smaller hands).  Me and my husband both have pocket knives, we carry every day. And we both are avid hikers, campers, outdoors-men, so have quite a few tactical knives.  So, we compared the size and sharpness to those knives (which were double and triple the price of this one).  It was a bit smaller than the knives we were carrying, but this is actually a good thing. It is much more comfortable in your pocket and not bulky, at all.  As far as sharpness,  this was extremely sharp!  I cannot say how long the sharpness will last, or how well it will sharpen back up.  But, after more use and sharpening, I will update this.  Knife is nice and light, yet seems pretty durable.  Have only used it for small jobs, but, so far, it's been great.  Locking mechanism works perfectly and it is easy to open and close.  For the last week, my husband has replaced his regular knife, with this one and loves it.  Is this knife as good as a K-bar or SOG? No, but it also doesn't cost close to those.  For the price, this is a great every day pocket knife.",5.0,0

I have used other silicone brushes before but they did not come apart and they would get built up discoloration or food particles where the head connected to the handle.  The brush head stays on very well during use also.  The spatulas are all well attached and no matter how hard I pulled them they did not loosen or pull off the handles.  I have had so many of the rubber or silicone spatulas pull off and its so aggravating.  They handles are large and sturdy and very easy to grasp and use.  They are easy to clean and I just throw my in my dishwasher. My favorite feature is unlike the rubber spatulas these don't stain or at least mine have not yet and I use them daily.

"THIS IS A GOOD REVIEW (all negativity ends to be a positive ending), I give it 5 stars!

I had a MAJOR lightning storm that killed about 5 of my electronics, including my desktops network card, which is built into the motherboard. When I found out it wasn't working, I went searching on Amazon for a new one (since Amazons merchandise is always on sale, or just plain cheap, money wise) and found this. I kept a tab on this open and looked at other, but my decision came back to this because of how cheap it was, and the good reviews, AND a similar story to mine someone else said (lightning storm, built into modem, etc. ) When I purchased it, I completely forgot about it until it arrived today. I soon hooked it up, excited and all. As soon as I power it on, I got that Limited but No Connectivity. I went through EVERYTHING trying to fix it, over an hour and a half. Nothing.

"I use this projector for a number of reasons, which I will list below.

1. It's small enough to fit in a pocket, or if you don't mind having to carry it around when not in use, it's plenty compact.
2. It's compact enough to fit in a backpack, or if you don't mind having to carry it around when not in use, it's plenty compact.
3. The sound quality is decent, and not overly loud, but I would prefer a little more bass, but I'm not sure that's a deal breaker.

The only real issue I have with it is the volume. It's a bit loud, but I would prefer to have it at 1/2 the volume.

Overall, it's a great projector, and the only thing I don't like about it is that it's not quite as bright as the HDTV that I have. It's not the brightest color, but that's not a big deal for me, but it's a big deal for me.

"I'm a 6'2 240 pound amateur bodybuilder. I ordered this for an alternative cardio method living here in South Florida and as a fishing platform. To be clear I use this solo as the single seater was too small and I exceed the weight limit.

First impressions it's not exactly portable long distances. It's cool because it fits in a closet in my apartment and easily in my truck bed but most people would struggle carrying the large heavy bag long distances. I suggest making very sure you have it fully inflated as all rigidity is lost otherwise. With this fully inflated I do still experience a bending where I am sitting but it comes with an inflatable pillow thing to jam in the corner...put it in the back corner and you'll be fine. It also seems quite durable. Similar material to whitewater rafts. I got caught in a rapidly leaving tide out in the mangroves and hit quite a few sharp sticks and things and didn't sink.

It actually tracks surprisingly well because of the added length and rudder thing you can put on the bottom. Tracks better than most cheaper end molded kayaks for sure.

The perks of having it oversized are immense. Plenty of leg room (for once) room for a cooler and all my fishing gear without being cramped. I always throw the air pump in the netting compartment also just to be safe.

Only complaint is I wish it had a collapsible fiberglass rod or 2 like a tent to give some stability to the hull.",4.0,0

"The Buttkicker adds a bit of shake to your home theatre.  It doesn't replace the subwoofer, but sort-of turns the floor into a lower subwoofer.  And I love it.  But there are some things you should know.

First, the LFE Kit (with Amp) is probably the best choice to start with because you can't drive it from your receiver - not enough power.  So getting in the game will cost you around $500. Which is more than for Aura Bass Shakers, but far better.

Second, one LFE Kit will do a sofa nicely, but if you, like me, mount it under your floor, you're gonna need two.  Possibly more, but probably two.  Because that's a LOT more mass to shake, and otherwise they'll be maxxing out and making a loud knocking noise.

Third, it's not like riding a rollercoaster.  You'll feel the floor shake from loud sound effects, bombs, etc., but don't expect magic.  It makes the movie more real, but it doesn't toss you around.

I currently have a wooden Lime & Lemon squeezer. That one is great for certain things that needs a bit of pulp of the Lime & Lemon. What I don't have is one of these Heavy Duty Lime & Lemon squeezer. This one has some weight to it and feels very strong in your hands. I like that there is 2 different bowl design. One for the Lime, since limes are smaller than the Lemon. And the other bowl for the Lemon. For some people, that is just extra work and troublesome when using it. I find it very useful and smart that they also made to color coded to match.

Now to use this properly, you MUST place the Lime or Lemon with the expose side, facing DOWN. This is how the squeezer works by pushing the Lime or Lemon down, causing it to flip inside out, so the juice can come out to the bottom of the squeezer. I know it looks like you should place the Lime or Lemon with the expose side facing up to match the squeezers shape but that will not work and Lime or Lemon juice will splash everywhere and there won't be that many juice coming out of it.

"REALLY good for keeping my fitbit in its case! I can see where the FITBIT ONE'S case can eventually become loose!  So got these.  Why am I knocking off ONE star? FIRST BIG CON!!!! The price!  These are 7 SIMPLE silicone bands, yes.. you get a few, but really? $13.99???!!!!!  They must be making at least 95% or more profit on these. If I would have found anything comparable, I would have purchased them.  I can get whole cell phone silicone cases for my Samsung Note for $5 or $7 bucks on Amazon or eBay, these have much less silicone, and I could see $2.99 or even $7 (a dollar per band).

Only ONE is needed, not 2 as in the photo.  Holds nice and tight.  If you want to get out of it cheap (zero cost) you can use a rubber band I guess, but I wanted something that didn't quite look archaic. Wish they had some NEUTRAL colors, but not a big deal if your fitbit is hidden in a bra, pocket etc...

OTHER CON: if you take our fitbit out of the case a lot, these bands are TIGHT,and you have to wiggle and jiggle them off.  So it is one more thing to deal with.  I keep mine in the original silicone case, with one of these bands around it, and just pop it in a zippered wristband I got for it.  That wristband they send with the fitbit one really sucks (you lost the fitbit in bed after less than one week wearing it to bed!).  Get a zippered case and never have to remove the fitbit ONE from the silicone case again.

I purchased these on Amazon last week.  I like them, but the price is WHOLLY crazy for these. But did I pay it, YES, because I couldn't find anything like it.  So spent the money.",4.0,0

"I bought the Griddler in February of 2005 and have taken care to ensure it lasts. The Griddler is heavy and sturdily constructed. It heats up quickly, and cleans up even faster. We have used it for panini, grilling meat, and toasting burger buns.  The unit can be used either as a panini/grill press with the floating top or opened up to use as a griddle.

The base of the unit heats up and maintains temperature better than the top. This creates uneven toasting of the Panini or other items. It's not so much of a problem using as a griddle, since one side will simply cook faster than the other.

After a year the nonstick surface has started pealing off of the grill plates. I have never used metal on the nonstick surface and have taken great care to preserve the finish. Perhaps it is in the design or a fate of nonstick coated products in general, but the now I will have to take care not to get pieces of the nonstick surface in my food.

The Griddler comes with interchangeable dishwasher safe griddle and grill plates with a lock and release system that is intuitive to use.  The plates easily release with the press of a button for cleaning.  To place the plates back on the Griddler, one simply rests the plates in the groves located towards the rear or bottom and snaps the front or top into place.  The plates don't consistently stay attached in the top section like they once did. It's very annoying trying to reposition a hot plate back into place.

On the surface, the Griddler has the looks and design to be a great product. Cuisinart has some bugs to work out to attain even heating and plates that last. If I were to buy a new panini press, I would not look to Cuisinart again.  As a matter of fact, I now enjoy using a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Breville-800GRXL-Indoor-Barbeque-and-Grill/dp/B000A76VCO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Breville 800GRXL Indoor Barbeque and Grill</a>&nbsp;instead.

"When I set out to buy a slow cooker for my mom, I was looking at higher models with all the bells and whistles and the convertible ones that are like 7 different kind of pots in one.  All digital, high-tech, everything mom did NOT want, lol.  I then reluctantly refocused and set out to find just a slow cooker that was roomy, easy to clean, had manual controls and no extra ""features"" that break down and people seldom use.  After viewing just about every offering on Amazon, I settled on this one because I liked the locking mechanism in case mom ever wanted to take her culinary delights on the road.  Knowing how picky mom is and how unhappy she would be if she didn't like it, I held my breath, hit buy and continued to hold my breath until it was delivered and the final verdict came in ... Then one day I got an excited call from a very happy, gourmet-chef mom who loved this slow cooker!  She uses it at least 3x/ wk and I get to hear about all the amazing things she's been cooking in this baby :)).  Mom especially likes the locking mechanism and how it easy it is to clean.  The cooker heats up quickly, cooks evenly and definitely does not spill when taken for a ride. Then she mentioned how relieved she was that I didn't send her one of those ""other"" ones ...

"Before you go jumping off into Hightech Hysteria, think about what you want to do with what you might be buying. It's almost worthwhile to consult someone who has an iPad or someone who can guide you to what would work best in you personal daily use. This is in most cases not going to replace a laptop, or a desktop computer. The size of the screen is really nice, but then you can't put it in a suit jacket pocket. Nice to have with you, Yes.

Make sure what you want to primarily want to do, really exists, this i not Mac OS X, this is iOS 4.3. If staying online is that important AND you don't mind carrying it around (it's not heavy, but it's bulky), then you could consider this gadget. It's like a sports car, it's nice to have, but it's not a necessity. What would be nice is something between the iPad 2 and the iPhone / iPad Touch sized iPad mini, that would be half the screen size of the iPad 2. This way, it might not fit in all suit jacket pockets, but could be carried in a shoulder holster or similar carrier under the jacket, sweater or what have you.

"Just received it and temporarily mounted it on my suspension fork to see how it will work. I can see some changes that would make it a five star product.
 One simple change: I think if the slotted mounting bars were welded to the inside of the rack it would go a long way towards preventing the rack from rubbing away at the paint on the fork; possibly even cause a thin spot on the rack tubing, eventually leading to failure. As it is, I think by I can solve that problem by swapping out the supplied bolts for a  little longer ones and adding some washers. Also, I'm pretty sure the heads on the carriage bolts supplied with the worm clamps will stick above the plastic liners and rub against the fork. Perhaps grinding a little off will help but that will expose the bolt to rusting. The brackets that mount the rack to the brake bosses on my suspension fork are not wide enough. They need to have a longer tab with a slot for better universal fit, but again, swapping out the supplied bolts for some longer and a few washers should do the trick. Since it's meant to be a universally mounted rack I think if they sent a length of spacer material that could be cut to the proper length, for bolts selected by the purchaser, and some thicker plastic liner for the worm clamps, this would be a 5 star rack. Using extra washers will work, but I am of the opinion that it always contributes to things loosening up quicker by allowing more play compared to a solid spacer.  All in all, I think it's a serviceable Light to Medium duty rack for a reasonable price. Like everything made to  fit many different styles, it will need some modification to be perfect for you.",4.0,0

The lining really babies the pistol.  It's great.  Plus, the paddle is rock solid secure.

"I'm an owner of a recording facility and I've been creating music and commercials for the public, for 26 years now. Most people never see the cables that we use, so let me give you the idea.

For instance I have about a dozen 8 channel snakes with the  inch ends that are interconnects to and from the console to rack mount effects and processors and or the in and outs of 16 channel sound cards. The cables used within these snakes are as small as can be used for convenience. They have molded plastic ends with strain relief and they are bundled into a flexible tube with about 18 inches of free cables at both ends.

There's another version that's a 16 + 2 channel snake into a room for live drums that allows for low Z microphones to be plugged into it, there's 18 tiny, thin cables within this snake. That one is 50 feet long.

When people are impressed by large diameter cables, I know that they haven't been educated in what's needed, that they've been educated by advertising.

This is a great cable that has what's needed. I tested it's shielding by listening with cranked up headphones and running it over sources of EMF and heard nothing. It's soft and flexible making it tangle resistant and it has strain relief. The fact that it's thin is convenient, it does not reduce the performance one bit.

So the picture may show what appears to be another cheap cable, but this one is a couple grades better than those. It will feel different, it's smaller and easier to work with and I'll bet that it's interference rejection ratio is higher too.

Really, if you want 5 feet of Tip-Ring-Sleeve stereo, line level cable for any use, this cable is very close to perfect and I recommend it. I'm using it in my recording facility when needed without issue.

It's a great little product, the only drawback is the metal rod is a bit too long for my small hands. It's not really a problem, I've had mine for a few months now.

"What a Great reel! If your new to baitcasters this is the one to get. I've got 3 chronarch c+4's, a curado, two abu Garcia Revo's, a Lews BB1 and a few other bass pro baitcasters. The T-wing system really is awesome. I also like how there isn't a side plate to open(especially if your new to baitcasters) because I was adjusting my ci4+ and the side plate fell in the lake once!!! I also usually put new bearings in my reels, but I don't this one needs it, because of how far it casts. The size of this reel makes it great for your palm, and is pretty light, and I'm comparing it to my Shimano Ci4+'s which are very light. I am by no means new to using baitcasters, but if I were to recommend one to someone that has very limited experience or is just buying their first one, I'd strongly recommend this as its pretty hard to backlash...

"I decided to jump on the chromebook bandwagon since so many people were raving about it. I will say that if you're used to having a Windows laptop and expect this to feel the same, you will be very disappointed. Sure you can check your email, browse the web or watch YouTube, but that's as far as it goes. It's capabilities won't really go past that. I wanted to Skype, and I could... If I went to their site each time and used their web extention. No option to download the app to make Skype just one click away. The same happened when I wanted to get a torrent downloader. None work with chromebook, and extentions that might have were a hassle to figure out. I didn't have a fresh goat or virgin to sacrifice on hand to make this task seamless. Not being able to download popular apps for all of my favorite things was the ultimate deal breaker for me. Some people will say you can do anything on a chromebook you can do on a windows or Mac laptop, but who wants to spend their day finding loop holes in a new system. I want simple with an easy user interface.

"This Tea Tumbler is fantastic! I am so happy that I was able to find it. I love the size I love the look, but without function it would just be a neat travel mug--this answers every need. If I want hot tea I just warm the mug up first with warm tapwater while I heat the boiling tea water and add loose tea to the strainer and snap it in the mug (it snaps sung, won't fall out on you). Then when I have water for tea just slowly pour the water over the tea and Wahla! Remove the strainer basket and away you go. If you want infused water, put your fruit or herbs in the mug, snap on the filter and add your water. The fruit stays in the water and you only get flavored water. No junk gets by the filter/strainer basket! AWESOME!! Note: everything BUT the bamboo lid is dishwasher safe. No instructions came with the item.

I was on a budget so after much shopping I decided this was the frame for me. I worried somewhat about putting it together as my husband, although multi talented has little patients for cheap products. Come Mother's Day we set to putting it together. My oldest daughter stepped up to help. What a surprise. They had it put together in less than an hour with no fuss or cuss. lol My husband has a helpful hint, when putting the wooden slats in don't tighten the middle support beam completely. This allows the slats to snap in with no effort. Just remember to tighten the middle support after attaching all the wooden slats. Also use your own wrench, the supplied one is of no use. The proper size is a metric #12 wrench. Ok, bed is up, now comes the true test. I am a big woman, weighting around 275 on a good day. Well, the bed didn't even creak when I laid down on it. I am also a restless sleeper so I toss and turn alot, bed is doing great. Several weeks after using my new bed, my neice and her boy friend came for an overnight visit. Now I don't know thier exact weights but I can say that the combined total was over the 600lbs. limit for the bed. I was worried but I love my neice and would never hurt her feelings for any reason. Not a problem, they spent 2 nights on it, and not one broken slat.

The manufacturer gave me this product for review. I believe my review is impartial.

- - - Notes - - -

Note 1: Apple products use their own rules to decide charging speed. A designed-for-Apple charger may be slow to charge non-Apple devices, and vice versa.

Note 2: Blocking other outlets. Seems like small thing, but it can be a hassle. Unplugging hotel room lamps, alarm clocks, etc. to charge your phone? Just say no (or carry an extension cord).

Almost bought a Yeti but then found out that Pelican made a US cooler. Super solid almost tactical build. But the coolest part about it which I discovered later is that standard steam table pans fit perfectly in the cooler. I use a 1/3 X 6'' deep pan to keep meat and cheese out of the ice. The lip of the pan rests in a groove near the top of the cooler and keeps the pan above the ice. It slides easily side to side to access below it without removing the pan. Very slick. 1/2 pans would work well too. The pans come in 2'' 4'' & 6'' depths. I have the 35qt. But the pans should work in the 45 & 65qt. since they all seem to have the same dimension from front to rear. See my user photo. Note the weight of this cooler. It is not a trivia item. I'm glad I got the '' small one''. It is bigger than it looks in the photos.,5.0,0

"I use this mouse with an ASUS TF300T android tablet. I hate mouse pads, which is the only option my ASUS keyboard accessory has. I do alot of data entry and document creation with my tablet, and the lack of a good mouse slowed me down quite a bit. This little mouse paired within seconds (just hold the buttons all down at once, like the description says) and was working immediately. Setting for it are accessible in the Setting menu under Language and Input. It operates smoothly, and is comfortable in the hand. It pairs immediately everytime I turn it on, and it has brought me back up to my accustomed speeds. The only complaint I have, and the reason it gets 4 stars instead of 5, is it's texture. It's contoured to be comfortable to the hand, and it is. But it's also slick all over. There's no rubberizered finish or textured band to give you hand purchase. I've dropped it many times, and foresee going through a few replacements because of it. But for the price and performance, I can live with that.",4.0,0

"Note that ""adjustable"" means the fit, using hook-and-loop closures, onto the body part.  These are not the type of weights which allow addition and removal of sandbags to adjust the weight.
The outside is a lycra-type material, making the weights comfortable against the skin.  They stay on well--I use them for ankles--but are easy to get on and off.

"I'm commenting here only about a belated experience to remark about the resiliency of this unit to water. In an attempt to move my jacket out of the way in boarding a kayak in fresh water (Rainbow River, Fl), one of the pockets of the gore-tex jacket accidentally hung out of the craft (unbeknowngs to me) when my partner sitting behind me said ""one of your pockets is in the water"". Yep, it had the Canon camera in it; it had been submerged inside the pocket for about a full minute (perhaps longer), but the pocket hadn't pooled with water, only was wet inside. Needless to say, it appeared to be a goner. The viewfinder had beads of water inside, and the screen inside showed condensation and water droplets. Also, the battery compartment had some water in it, but not pooled, but enough that I could pour out several drops from it. I removed the batteries, and over a period of about 60 hours, exposed the camera to sunlight on the dashboard and inside the glove compartment to dry out. It gradually dissapated the droplets inside the viewfinder, and the condensation from the inside screen disappeared. Only at that time did I attempt to turn it on. I couldn't believe it! The 4GB SD card was intact with the pics, and the motor successfully retracted the lens. A few trial pics confirmed that the camera is now back in working order. Call it luck, but patience prevailed in letting natural sunlight and warmth bring it back to life. I'm impressed with this experience.",4.0,0

"this coffee maker is great for families that consume lots of coffee...

PROS: it keeps all of the coffee hot.
has a seperate button for those times you only need 1-4 cups...if you don't press this, coffee is not strong (water gets hotter with this button)
large capacity.
beeps when done brewing.
great look on counter!

CONS:1)large design, might be overwhelming in a small kitchen, also you cant really fit under standard sized cabinets, unless u pull out each time you want to make coffee, when you lift top to get to water area, the top will hit the underside of the cabinets.
2) hard to tell how much coffee is in it despite the Full/Empty gauge. beeps very faintly so u must listen in order to hear it when brewing is complete.
3) MAJOR ONE--you need to keep a microfiber cloth under the unit, otherwise the condensation comes out and seems to make the unit leak. also, when u pour water into the reservoir, you need to use a spouted cup to minimize the amount of water that falls out onto the counter...takes some practice, but worth it in the end.

BEST THING TO DO IS BUY WARRANTY THROUGH SQUARETRADE (online), THEY OFFER 3 YEARS ON IT, AND WILL FULLY REFUND PRICE IF IT BECOMES DEFECTIVE WITHIN THAT TIME! YOU DONT NEED A RECEIPT OR ANYTHING, JUST FILL OUT INFO AS SOON AS U BUY THE MACHINE.

It would have been nice to have some of this survival gear. And that made me think I do live in a area where natural disasters happen, you never know and you do want to be prepared.

"I have owned one of these for some time and recently got a new one for a second computer.  It's a great quality keyboard that lacks a lot of the new fangled style and shape, (thank God) of other keyboards that cost so much more and are at times far from the coolest thing around.  I'm speaking of the so called wrap around keyboards that supposedly are more realistically or comfortably designed for our hands.  Sometimes even certain keys are bigger or curled around or something or other.  My experience with them are that most have been far from the ""better mousetrap"" to be sure.  I have wavered in the past from the basic, classic idea that this keyboard is, but not anymore.  Not only has Amazon gotten it dead on with this baby, but they have also managed to improve it a little without messing up the works.  The letters on my old keyboard are not fading at all, (something that always happens on cheap keyboards with the letters used most often), but they have also separated the keys nicely so that its easy to clean and not hit two keys at once when you have fat fingers like me.  Also, this keyboard has a slight built in elevation in the back that is a better quality than the little tabs that other keyboards have that are are often flimsier.  And lastly this keyboard stays put very well with good solid feet to prevent you chasing it around your desk while working.  The only thing about this keyboard that I personally had a problem with is its USB plug.  My computer is so old it still has the rounded plug in the rear for a keyboard.  Fortunately adapters for such old time 'puters are easy to be found and I had one already.

The top has latches on all four sides, ensuring there won't be any leaks.

I am 6'1"" and weigh 190 pounds. The length of the grip is about 1 1/2"" and the width is about 1 1/2"" and the width of the grip is about 1 1/2"". They do not fit perfectly on my hands.",5.0,1
"Good Quality bag, should hold up well. Like the looks of it. Tapered front fits under seat well. Strap on rear for tail light is nice.
I don't care for some bags out there that have all kinds of outside straps, bottle holders, pockets, etc. This one is more streamlined with your stuff stored inside the bag, not held somehow on the outside. And the inside is roomy!

Held back on a 5 star rating for several reasons.

One, it's a little pricey. Forty bucks is a lot for a bag to store stuff on the back of your bike.

And secondly the design of how the top opens up could be better.
The top is held closed by two zippers down each side, plus a velcro closure across the front.
The velcro flap is located under your seat, where it is hard to get to. And it's strong velcro, so you really need to get a firm grip on it.
And then the zippers are held together with a strap, the idea being that you can pull on the strap and open both zippers at the same time.
In theory this sounds good but reaching the strap, which is also under the seat, is not the easiest thing to do either.

I ended up cutting off the strap holding the 2 zippers together. This helps quite a bit. Now I can quickly open the bag just on one side without having to undo the velcro. And you can pretty much grab what you want with just one zipper open.

IF the zippers opened from the rear, and the velcro closure was across the rear, then it would be an ideal bag and maybe I wouldn't feel like forty bucks was too much for it.",4.0,0

"Bed frames hold up a mattress, and usually, that is all they do.  This one is the first one I have ever owned that made the mattress feel more supportive, more flat, and all around better to sleep on.  And the mattress is a top of the line Royal Pedic. This frame is built like a military war machine but anyone of average intelligence can assemble it, without tools of any kind, in about ten minutes.  No matter how you interpret the instructions put the wheels on first.  To get them to seat in the plastic inserts you will need a hard ( tile, concrete, steel, etc.) surface and straight line pressure.  Once in the plastic insert the wheels will easily seat in the frame.  The center ""T"" will only fit one way.  Do not force it.  If you are doing it properly, it will drop right in.  Get the wheeled version and off-set the locking wheels at opposite ends and sides.  When it is time to clean under the frame, you will be glad those wheels are helping you move it.

"I built my desktop Windows machine in September 2007, and although it is still going strong with four 1. 5 TB Seagate hard drive in a RAID configuration, with only 4 GB of RAM (and less than that accessible on a 32-bit version of Windows Server 2003) it had hit a wall for the database development I do on Linux virtual machines with PostgreSQL. A consultant friend told me about the benefits of SSDs over hard drives for _random_ as opposed to sequential reads, so I decided to give it a try. The Samsung drive was trivial to install as an additional drive. I migrated my VMs to it, and they run dramatically faster on complex SELECT statements especially with multiple table joins. Then I took a few extra steps, which I cannot recommend too highly:  I moved my Windows paging file to the SSD, and made it larger (6 GB). Then I created \Temp and \Users\myname\Temp directories on the SSD, and pointed the global and local tmp and temp environment variables to them. What a difference!  Windows runs noticeably better on almost everything I do with it. The hard drive flashes furiously as always, but a lot of the time there is no sound of hard drive heads thrashing around. I believe the installation of the Samsung SSD postponed my need to build a new computer for at least a year, maybe three or more.",5.0,0

"I purchased this (Displayport model) to add a 27 inch 2560 x 1440 Asus monitor to my 3-year-old HP dv7 / Win7 laptop. I am quite satisfied with the performance, although there a few (quite minor) wrinkles which may be specific to my setup and may not affect anyone else. They are as follows:

There may be HDCP protection issues that I have not figured out yet. (Yesterday when trying to watch a video on Amazon Prime, the message ""will not be displayed in HD due to HDCP issues, continuing in SD"" or something like that. (A Blu-ray disc, however, plays just fine.) My computer normally runs at less than 20% CPU usage, but trying to play a particular video on Hulu the other day sent the CPU up to 62%. No other video source has caused that problem. And it was only one time.
And I have the feeling the computer runs a bit hotter than before, causing the fan to be on more.
The computer has stopped responding a couple times, requiring a hard shutdown, followed by the message ""AMD Graphics driver has stopped responding and has recovered."" I leave that to you to interpret.

Again, these issues may be specific to my computer setup.

I had to update by USB controller driver, but a link at the Ableconn site made it quite easy.

Follow-up: All issues have been resolved: I updated the AMD driver for my Radeon graphics chip (their web site made it easy to do so) and I no longer get any freezeups; there is no problem playing HDCP streaming media, and using Internet Explorer / Silverlight for streaming playback uses only a nominal amount of CPU (it is the Displayport software that uses the CPU, I think).",5.0,0

It works well, but I do not like the way the buttons feel. I wish it had a more tactile feel. The buttons are not too big, but they are not too small either. The buttons are a bit small for my needs, but they are not too big either. The 3D is nice, but I do not like the way the 3D is displayed.

"This is the camera that DxO Labs gave the following rating for:
""No need for suspense: this new 16.3 MP sensor is simply the best APS-C we have tested so far, sometimes able to compete even with very high-end full-frame cameras.

The overall score of the K5 puts it in the lead with 82 points -- more than 9 points better than the D90 or the Alpha 55, and 16 points ahead of the Canon 7D or 60D. The K5 is literally the best APS-C performer for each segment, even in low ISO"".

I am no professional. I had used a basic DSLR prior to this the k2000. So this review is based on someone upgrading from a beginner SLR to a more sophisticated one.

Pros:

Low light: This is a camera that takes great low light pictures, you can push the ISO up pretty high and still get great pictures. This was the biggest reason for me to upgrade. I had a hard time taking pictures of my kids in various performances with terrible lighting conditions. Obviously one needs a good lens. But with my old camera I had to throw too many away. This camera combined with the DA 50-135mm lens is one terrific package for such situations.

Weight/Size: this is the most compact camera at such a level that you will find.

Weather resistant: This is a weather resistant camera! Combine this with a weather resistant lens and you are all set.

Electronic Level: I thought this was a gimmick but after using it for a few days, I find it indispensable to take level photos.

User Selectable Focus points: these are standard in expensive cameras, nothing special if you have used such cameras before but for somone upgrading I quickly found out how convenient this was.

Shake reduction: Pentax unlike Nikon/Canon has shake reduction built into the camera, so any lens you put on it has shake reduction function.

Lenses: Pentax has small pancake lenses called limited lenses. Try these if you are new to Pentax. They are superb and great to walk around with without looking like a dork.

Cons: Expensive...",5.0,0
"This is an exact OEM replacement for my 24V/80lb iPilot Riptide ST, and presumably other similar models.  This is a great unit and meets my every expectation.

Linking is snap.  Hit the learn button on the head of the iPilot and hit any button on the remote.  You will get a confirmation beep.  That's it.

This stays on as long as your iPilot is on.  As the remote battery ages, the remote will go to sleep on you.  This is normal. I have never experienced any other disconnection or difficulty with linking with the original remote or this replacement.  When the remote goes to sleep, the trolling motor keeps doing whatever it was doing.

If you are having trouble linking remote or are losing connection (other than the sleep mode to save battery on the remote), it is more likely that your iPilot unit is going bad.  Keep that in mind before you throw this product under the bus.  These remotes are solid as a rock.

I recommend having at least two methods to control your trolling motor.  This remote plus the foot pedal, or two of these remotes, or one of these remote and one mini remote, etc.  Also, having a couple extra batteries on board is a good idea.  The batteries last me about 10-12 months with moderate use, and replacements can store unused for 3 years or more.  You do get some warning that the battery is dying, but not super accurate.

This does not include the fancy Minn Kota lanyard.  The product description does not say that it is included.  Minn Kota website does not say it is included.  I don't know where people are getting the idea that this product brings the lanyard.  To be clear, this product does not bring the lanyard.  It is the remote unit with the battery installed.  That's it.  Do not take away stars from an otherwise stellar product because you wanted more that was supposed to come with the product.",5.0,0

"I like this because it is small and ergonomically well designed.  I am keeping it.  However, there are many tradeoffs and issues that anyone should note:

1.  The movie function is better in quality than stills for almost all conditions.

2.  The movie function sound picks up faint noise from absolutely everything the camera does, from zoom to auto adjust the focus.  This can only be heard under quiet conditions, but it is there, and in fact mentioned in the manual.

3.  The low light still is very poor, except if it is pitch dark and you set it for that condition.  I find taking pictures indoors without the flash superior than with it on.

4.  The camera is very sensitive to shakes during still...and the image stabalizer only works for movies.  This really needs a good image stabalizer for stills, since slight motion ruins the image, particularly in zoom.

5.  It is true you can take a still while recording a movie.  However, what is not mentioned, is that the movie is interrupted during the capture and that sounds of shutter clicking at quite high level invade the audio

There is a dedicated button on the left side, separate from the normal button group, that will activate the backlight, but it's hard to find and press it. The result is that you take a chance pressing another button on the front panel just to get the light turned on.  Safest way is to nudge the volume button, since that one is easy to find and hard to mistake for another button.  It would be a better design to have an easy to use front button to turn on the light and keep it on a little longer.

I've seen it the way she uses the pump and I realized that it does required rapid force applied correctly at the pump. If you apply force say at one side then the pump gets stuck.

I picked this up for my 9 year old who loves playing baseball. Is he the best player on his team? No. He wants so badly to play shortstop, but isn't the best fielder. He was getting discouraged about always playing in the outfield. He has improved with team practices, but really has no one to help him to practice at home. This net has been amazing because he can go out by himself and throw and catch the ball for HOURS by himself. In a few short days he has already improved his fielding skills and is eager to show them off to coach before his next game.

It was incredibly easy to put together. All the pieces are labeled ON THE ACTUAL PIECE, so once you take it out of the plastic you can STILL identify it exactly which piece it is. One piece had the ""snap"" on the wrong side so it's not exactly ""snapped"" into place, but it still holds. I double checked the instructions and it just looks like I got a wacky piece.  The net goes on easy. Once you get a rhythm down it's easy to snap on without pinching any fingers, but still be careful.

The instructions also include instructions on where to throw the ball for which types of rebounds.

As amazing as this product is, I only rated it 4 stars for because of the wonky piece that doesn't snap and because it's not very compact making storage an issue. The kick stand is the only thing that folds (which keeps the net nice and tight.) This is something you will need a large space to store as it is large and wavy. We will be storing our in our garage against the wall. It's no big deal, really, but I know some want small and portable--but this isn't it.

"Okay so logitech has been very well known in making good webcams. This cam arrived ontime. There however was a problem where the mic wasn't really working well or something. I returned it and got another one that seems to work pretty well.

Now the video quality is pretty good. Even though it might not be the best compared to their newest one (That long blue expensive webcam they just came out with a year ago) but its pretty good if you want a cam that is cheaper, especially after the rebate if they are still offering one.

Unfortunately the mic seems to not be the best it could have been but considering my previous webcam was so old it was fuzzy looking this mic works a lot better. I wanted one with a really good mic as well as good video quality. The video quality is great but the features it comes with are kinda lacking. Im talking about the little animations and such. You don't get a lot when you first install it you have to hunt down some good ones on the website in order to get some cool looking ones.

The other features such as low light can be good or bad depending on how you use them. Also the ""right sound"" seems to just make things worse I think. Its hard to say since I don't use my webcam that often.

However I think this is one of the better webcams you can pick these days. Just make sure to check it out and try it out a bit right away when you get it just incase you get a faulty one like I did. Oh and logitech has a forum for questions and they usually answer them right away or within a day or two.

"I've been in the market for a nice tumbler for awhile, I've tried a few others...but I've had my issues with them. Namely, they sweat when you put ice in them, or the bottom of cup is way too narrow to stick my hand in and clean the thing, or the plastic straw wears out or develops a curve over time....However, the Chillz Stainless Steel Tumbler has been great. It doesn't sweat, I love the size, 30 oz lets me put in enough ice and still have enough room for water so I don't have to keep filling the thing back up, the larger base also allows me to clean it with relative ease, what I really like about it is the stainless steel straw, I've never had one before and it's been a game changer in my opinion.  For me it seems it makes the drink feel colder when you have a lot of ice in it, not to mention is also doesn't bend over time.  There are a few drawbacks though...Namely the lid isn't exactly spill proof, there's an opening at the top for the straw, but it's a big opening so the star can move around and if you knock it over (which I have) you'll get a decent sized mess to clean up, the other thing is that it's not dishwasher safe, which is no big deal because like I said, it's easy to clean, but if your big on not doing dishes then this may not be for you.

"I'm not sure if I'd really call this ""high gain"", but thanks to its antenna and USB extension cord, it does a better job of pulling in wi-fi signals than your typical ""nano"" or compact USB wi-fi adapter. The box contains the adapter, which looks like an oversize USB flash drive; screw-on antenna, a USB extension cord that's maybe 2 feet long, and a mini CD containing the drivers.

One minuscule quibble: Like most USB wi-fi adapters, this one comes with a cap intended to protect the USB plug when the adapter is not in use. And, like most USB wi-fi adapters, it has no means for stowing or otherwise retaining that cap when the adapter IS in use. My guess is that most people eventually lose the cap. This is of no real consequence except, perhaps, aesthetics.

The best improvement in wi-fi performance is achieved by using the provided extension cord to position the adapter above and away from your computer, where it can get the best possible signal. Of course, there's no reason why you couldn't buy your own USB extension cord and use that to improve the signal with a more conventional USB wi-fi adapter. But the antenna, which actually contains metal parts configured in a way that really does boost the gain, still gives the TL-WN722N an edge over a nano adapter with an extension cord.

As with most USB wi-fi adapters, this one comes with unneeded wi-fi management software. (Most wi-fi management software has been superfluous since Windows XP Service Pack 3 gave Windows robust, built-in wi-fi management.) Unlike with some other adapters, there is no way to install just the drivers you need while omitting the management software that you don't need. But after it's installed, you can set Windows as the wi-fi manager.",4.0,0

Found a non bath cheesecake recipe and made it in this pan.  Don't have to worry about leaks.  Here it is
New York Cheesecake.
2 pounds cream cheese
3/4 cup white sugar
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1 cup sour cream
1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs
6 tablespoons melted butter
1/4 cup white sugar
Directions
1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C).
2. Mix graham cracker crumbs, melted butter, and 1/4 cup sugar together. Press mixture onto the bottom of one 9 or 10 inch springform pan. Place in freezer for 10 minutes.
3. Cream 3/4 cup of the sugar and cream cheese until smooth. Beat in eggs, vanilla, and cornstarch until just mixed. Stir in sour cream and mix on medium until well blended. Remember to scrape sides during mixing. Pour into prepared crust.
4. Bake at 400 degrees F (205 degrees C) for 10 minutes. Turn temperature down to 210 degrees and bake for 45 minutes. Turn oven off and leave cake in oven  until cool.  About 2 to 3 hours. Do NOT open oven door from the time you put it in the oven until it is cooled.  Refrigerate for at least 4 hours.  Preferably over night.  Serve with your favorite topping.

"An all in one idea sounds perfect but fails horribly.
Here's all the things that aren't good first:
1. Many parts to clean every time one brews
2. Condensation in the grinder causes coffee grind caking
3. 'Finished brewing' five beeps goes off and there's still 1/4 of the water left in the\ machine

If any of these things go wrong, it leads to big messes and weak coffee.
Way too many things have lead to mornings ruined.  After one spends 5 minutes and 10 gallons of water rinsing all the parts, you have to take this top mechanism piece of cheap plastic off the basket, rinse that, dump the basket, rinse that, check that no grounds are at the bottom of the basket holder, take off the carrafe's lid, check that no rogue grounds are stopping the shut off valve from letting the coffee run.  If you're tired and forget to empty the basket after being distracted from all the other steps, it over flows.  WHen the water collects in the system from not completing brews, you make a pot of coffee and it overflow. Grounds stop the basket hole, it overflows, the shut off valve's stuck with grounds, it over flows.  Think it's working well?  Check behind your counter, there's probably gallons of brewed coffee that has escaped and you don't know it!

"The keyboard has a cheap, PC Jnr/ Speak n Spell toy game feel. The biggest problem is the function keys are pre programmed and override all functions you normally use them for. For example the F1 key overrides ALL previously programmed functions AND QUITS ANY OPEN APPLICATION when it's pressed. It's been close to an hour now I have had it plugged in and trying to search the internet and Apple websites to figure out how to override Macally's function keys. If you find this inconvenience tolerable and the feel of a toy keyboard is ok, then by all means go for it.

Update 31/10/16
Upon receipt of additional info not immediately discernible in the instructions that came with the keyboard, my headache about the function keys is now solved. Apparently it was simply a matter of pressing the FN key and the Up or Down arrows to change function key functionality. I'm most grateful to the folks at Macally for their assistance. I am now adjusting my review and will recommend the keyboard to you - if you have no problems with the cheap keyboard feel. The keyboard itself works as it should, the keys are low profile but provide good tactile feedback response when pressed. I also should mention the keyboard comes with a cool Macally mouse - which works really great. So, to sum it up in pros and cons
Cons: Cheap, toy feel
  Instructions were not as clear as they could have been - I was not able to understand from the instructions that the FN and up and down arrow keys toggle functionality. Maybe it was my poor understanding, but I felt it could have been made more plain

Pros: Good tactile feedback response from all keys

"This camera bag is great!  If you have a mirror-less set up it would be ideal.  For a regular sized DSLR maybe not so much.  I bought this to replace my AW150 slingshot, which as a big guy...is a horrible backpack.  I really like this backpack, but the camera compartment is too cramped.  I will be returning it and getting the larger version for the extra camera room.

Pros:
-You can definitely fit a 11"" Macbook Air and an Ipad (at the same time) in the front compartment, there are two separate pockets.
-Side pockets are super nice for a bottle.
-The removable camera compartment makes it a fully usable backpack.
-It comes with a bunch of Velcro inserts for the camera compartment so you can configure it how you want.
-The waist strap is big.  easily over 50"" when fully extended.  The chest strap too is pretty generous

Cons
-The camera compartment is small.  It can hold my DSLR (Old T3i with 18-55 kit lens)) and barely a 55-250 lens. The camera wouldn't fit at all with the larger lens attached.
-If anything protrudes even slightly above the top of the camera compartment you can feel it in your back.

"I've owned many-a steam mops in my day, and while this is a great mop that heats up quickly and offers a bunch of nice features, I wouldn't pay the hundred and forty dollars they're asking for this. There are just too many other, cheaper models out there that get your floors just as clean.

Now, if you're someone who sees yourself using the detachable handheld all the time, then this may be the steam mop for you. I THOUGHT I would use it all the time, but in reality I only used it once...the first day I got it.

The machine is light and easy to use while you're actually using it, but if you need to set it down, it's prone to tipping over due to it's shape.  The tank seems to go through water faster than other mops I've used, but maybe that's just me. Or maybe the steam gets hotter than other mops I've used, so it goes through water quicker? I don't know, but I do know I have to fill the tank three times to get all the hardwood/tile/stone in my house done.

Overall, would I recommend this mop? Absolutely. I just don't think it's necessary for the amount of money it costs (unless you really want that detachable steamer). There are plenty of high-quality steam-mops out there for much cheaper.",3.0,0

"ok this unit arrived about 2 days after I ordered it,  it was packaged very well,  I was wanting the stainless steel version because I thought it would hold up much better,  after I read a few things on the net I discovered that Copper actually dissipates heat better than stainless,  so I got this AFTER I read copper has gone up about 40 percent lately and I didn't want to wait any longer.  So far I soaked it in a vinegar solution  with water to get all the goo off of it and plopped it down in the keg with boiling wart,  this sanitized it,  the wort was cooled to about 70 within 9 minutes this may be because I have well water and its very cold.  If you are wanting to make beer on a regular basis and you have a large brew pot just get the 50 ft version,  its only about 20 dollars more (at this time) and it will cool your wart that much faster and you can brew 5 gallons or 10 gallons.

bottom line copper is getting freaking expensive,  if you are going to get a wort chiller made of copper get it soon and get the most you can afford, don't wait today is march 4 and oil was at 105 so its just going to get more expensive and you can make cheep beer,  so it will pay for its self the sooner you buy it and use it.

"Great little juicer!!!  Started using it the night it arrived.  So far I've put apples, carrots, beets, greens, oranges, grapefruit, peaches, plums, onions, garlic, kale, spinach and sweet potatoes through it.  Of all of that, only the beets and sweet potatoes have been an issue.  Their stringy material tends to try and bind the auger but simply turning backwards and loosening it up sends it on through.  The cranking isn't overly difficult or strenuous, although I do wish it would extract a bit more juice, the pulp is still a bit damp when extracted.  Still, all in all for someone that's just starting into juicing, I think it's pretty great.  I should note this was originally bought for wheatgrass juicing and it arrived 5 days faster than I expected so my wheat grass is still growing and not ready to put through it.  Beat tops, carrot tops, kale, and spinach all went through fine, so I'm sure the wheat grass will also.",5.0,0

"I have UAG cases for my iPhone and iPad mini. Given my positive experience with them, it was a no-brainer to get one for the iPad Pro.

I like the dark blue because it isn't another all black case but it isn't an overly flashy color either. I like to cruise just under the radar but still have some style. ;)

Functionally, the case fits well, all ports and buttons are easy to access, it is well protected both opened and especially when closed, and the FrogSkin cover is easy to grip and simple to clean. The cover is easily adjustable and the stand can be detached, it is compatible with a keyboard, it has a ""Smart"" cover to put the device in sleep mode, and there is a stylus holder (see photo).

"Soup & Salads-from-scratch makers: THIS CHOPPER IS FOR YOU!  Just about every ingredient you'd use in soups/salads can be chopped in this machine.

Chopped pieces are relatively uniform in size, and can be chopped into large or smaller squares.  Here's a tip: The least-fatiguing way to use this is to place the machine on a table of lower height--for me, that is 26"".  From this lower height, I can use my upper body weight, just like tall people do, to aid the chopping motion.  I can do 10lbs carrots in about 15mins.  The only feature missing is where to find replacement chopping screens.  Anyway, scoop this chopper up, you'll be very glad you did.",5.0,0

"You can read that title either way, because it is a great big knife -- really big.  It's also a great, big knife.  I have way more  knives than I need and quite a few big knives.  I bought this one primarily because it was inexpensive and it looked pretty cool.  I have it paired (via ranger bands)  with the Condor Kephart and I took them out to the woods with me one rainy day last week looking for river birch and fat wood to replenish my depleted fire tender materials.  When I started to delimb a fallen pine to hack out some fat wood, I was really surprised and impressed by how easily this knife did the job. It does just as good at that sort of work as my Esee Junglas, for example, and costs 1/4 the price. So if you're looking for a good, big, woods knife, but want to spend less than 100 bucks (heck you can get 2 of them for less than 100 bucks), this is definitely one to consider -- assuming you are more  hunter/woodsman oriented and less tactical/survivalist oriented.

Incidentally, this particular knife came hair shaving sharp right out of the box with even grinds on both sides, although this is sometimes not the case with Condor knives.  The heavy leather sheath is what one normally expects from condor and after being well oiled, both inside and out, it has conformed nicely to the knife with good knife retention. So far I'm very impressed.  It really is a great, big knife.",5.0,0

I keep it stored in the refrigerator and so far we've used it to grate nuts and chocolate over ice cream as a topping, sprinkled over oatmeal, added to brownie batter before baking, and  it has even been used to grate pecans directly onto pancakes.

This mill comes with two different size blades. The smaller blade grates very small, the nuts come out looking like a nut meal. I prefer the larger size blade, nuts and chocolate come out with a nicer texture. The extra blade can be stored inside of the cap, which is a very nice feature.

I like the viewing windows on the side, you can see at a glance if you need to refill. I learned not  fill it too full, if filled too full screwing the cap back on can become a bit of a challenge. This mill seems to work better when it is lightly filled anyways, especially if you have a mix of different items inside so you can get a better mix when you turn the mill.

Just turn the mill like you would a pepper grinder and the grated nuts, cheese, or chocolate come out the bottom. There is a small cap that fits over the bottom that helps keep everything fresh and also helps keep any stray crumbs contained. This is very easy to use and helps make baked goods look a tiny bit fancier. This mill is a useful little kitchen gadget that I find myself using much more than I thought I would.

"I bought this bag for my average-souse 10-year-old daughters first time doing summer swim team. Its a pretty bag but she doesnt look silly carrying it. It turns out most kids actually have the Speedo Teamster bag, which is a little larger with more pockets. After the first week of morning practice I was convinced we made the right choice. The bag held her towel, a change of clothes, and a pair of running shoes with room to spare.
However, after meets started, Im less convinced of this batman perfection. Apparently, you need a towel to sit on, and a towel to dry off with, and if you have two hours between races, you don't want to try off with the same cold wet towel you used earlier. So you definitely need 2 towels, preferably 3. And it might be pretty cool by the time the meet is over so a shorts outfit AND a sweatpants outfit gets packed. Plus things like goggles, sunglasses, regular glasses, money, sunblock, etc. At that point, this bag isn't quite big enough and definitely doesnt have enough pockets. Daughter has started packing small things in gallon ziplocks so they can be thrown in the large compartment without getting wet or lost among the towels  of which shes just been making do with two because three big fluffy towels will just not fit.

The other thing that should be noted is how the bag hangs. It curves, so the mesh pocket ends up parallel to the ground, and if you try to put a water bottle in there its going to fall out. Goggles and swim cap and lip balm are fine in there, and thats what she needs to access the quickest when she gets to the pool so it works, but a dedicated water bottle pouch would be nice.  So while I LIKE this bag, and the quality seems good, it might not be the best bag for our needs. If it bites the dust and daughter keeps swimming, Id probably replace it with a Teamster.",4.0,0

FINALLY,,, I found a hanger made by Shimano especially for cheap bikes... The url below shows the proper hanger...It should be sold right on the same page as the derailleur but that would make our lives to simple. Anazon seems to not have a clue that some of us guys would like a better derailleur than the stuff we got with our cheap bikes and this one fits IF ONLY they tell you how to buy the hanger...

I was taught that at every opportunity, I should make life better for others so I hope this review saves YOU the trouble I went through trying to fit this on my bike....Not everyone buys high dollar bikes but some of us like to put good parts on our cheap ones, it seems the sellers have no clue and don't inform us well.

IF Shimano would tell more people about this easy way to fit expensive derailleurs on cheap bikes I bet MORE cheap bikes would have better parts. Because I had to go through hell to find this part I gave this review 4 stars instead of the 5 it deserves..The part works very well...Getting it on the bike was hell..

"I am a professional filmmaker and videographer. I've been working in the industry for six years, and I just wrapped up principle photography on a feature length PBS documentary. I shoot 1080p high definition HDV video and the ONLY mini-DV tape stock I trust is Panasonic AY-DVM63PQ, better known as Panasonic PQ, for ""professional quality."" Although this tape is designed for DV video, I shoot HDV (high definition video) on it all the time. In my experience, it performs just as well as HDV tape, if not better. I have shot literally hundreds of hours of 1080p high definition video on this tape stock, and I've almost never had a dropped frame. Do NOT buy the cheaper consumer-grade tapes (e.g. DVC tape). Those cheap consumer tapes are a recipe for disaster. If you use cheap consumer tapes, frames will be dropping like flies. The bottom line is that professional work requires professional tape, and professional tape doesn't get better than this. This tape is incredibly reliable, and perfect for archiving. I just pulled some archived tapes off the shelves, 3-4 years old and still playing back at perfect quality, no signs of degradation at all. This stuff LASTS! Unbeatable quality for the price.

It fits nicely, and seems to be pretty thin (which I wanted). My only slight complaint is that it isn't exactly what I'd call RED red. It's more of a dusty red, or a very dark pink. Kind of rosy, perhaps? Anyways, it actually works out okay for me because it matches the red portion of my Supcase Unicorn Beetle black/red case very VERY well. It's really hard to match reds, and the red of the case isn't particularly red, either. However, the color of the case and cover are so close as to pretty much be the same, which is great for me. A tiny ring of red now peeks out around the case's camera hole. I'm about to upload a picture, check it out. I think it looks pretty damn good. On a side note, and it doesn't bother me at all for my purposes - the cover isn't exactly what I'd call rubberized. I was expecting something perhaps a little grippy and more textured, but the cover is basically just matte finish. If it's actually ""rubberized"", then it's the thinnest rubber coating I've ever seen. If I ordered this with the intention of not using it with a case and having a grippy rear cover, I'd be pretty upset. Really, for my own purposes this is a 5 star product, but I think if I didn't have this narrow use-case, I'd have called it 4 stars. So there ya go.",4.0,0

"Bought this because I thought it was time to upgrade my old Harmony One. The physical Harmony Home remote is fantastic. I love the simple design, love the fact that you can program buttons to do two different things depending on if you long press or short press. Love that it's RF. If Logitech threw an LCD and backlight on this thing, it would be the best remote they've ever created.

Where the problems begin is there's no LCD on the remote. Your smartphone is supposed to take on that task and unfortunately, the app that makes this possible just sucks. Sometimes it's slow to connect to the hub, sometimes it crashes, sometimes the hub just stops responding to it. More often than not, I would grab the OEM remotes because it was so much faster and less frustrating. That's not a good sign.

I actually managed to put up with the app for a while, but the thing that had me running back to my Harmony One was when something gets out of sync (happens more than you think), there's no ""help"" button on the remote. I had to dig my phone out, unlock it, launch the app, wait for it to find the hub, hope the app doesn't crash, then fix the sync problem. This would take me 2 seconds to fix with my old Harmony One. With Harmony Home, it takes a good minute.

I don't like the direction Logitech is going with the smartphone thing. They need to focus on making good physical remotes. Does anyone really enjoy using their smartphone as remote? It's clumsy and takes too long to do anything with. I cringed every time I needed to launch the Harmony app to do something. I need tactile buttons Logitech!",2.0,0

To get it to grind, I have to constantly shake the unit while grinding so that the blades are grinding coffee beans versus air. The dial is so loose for the grind grading, that just touching it could shift it. Same with the timer. Don't accidentally touch it because the time will shift. Finally, there is ground coffee all over the counter-top every day because the cup is so static that there is coffee in and out of the cup. I don't usually write reviews much, much less bad one.

"I initially mounted this scope on my AR, and have used it in about half a dozen outings. I found that I was really fighting with it, usually spending a good amount of ammo on constantly sighting and fixing. I will say, it is what it is, an under $100 scope, that I attempted on a .223 platform. There are hundreds of reviewers here that have been happy with this setup on an AR, but it just didn't work for my use (150 yards or less, mostly 100). When it was on, it was on. It just never stayed. You really need to have a strong understanding of MOA, scope centering and sighting, field of view, point of impact, etc, but especially with the cheaper scopes, as the adjustments will be crude and course. With higher end optics, the settings and adjustments are smooth and precise. I was able to mount this to my son's 10/22, and hopefully that will be an appropriate application. So if you are considering this for an AR, (just my 2 cents), there are plenty of lower cost options available slightly above the low end UTG products that offer much more.",3.0,0

"I love these headphones.  I used them every day on my commute to and from work - train, subway.  The noise cancelling is truly impressive.  When you put these on (powered off) they already block a lot of sound.  Switch them on (best in a noise environment - even a bathroom with the vent on or a car with the a/c on) and it's magical how everything grows very silent.  The sound is very good too - I loved my Sony MDR-V6 headphones for years and my initial impression was that the Bose was not quite as good.  Then after a couple weeks listening to the Bose I went to put on my Sony's and was dismayed to find that they no longer fit me well and the sound was no longer special.  These are much more comfortable and the ear cups are larger to fit my whole ear.  Back to the noise cancellation - it works like this:  you sit in a quiet car in the train station parking lot, and listen to music at a low volume.  The train arrives and you hop on.  The overall noise level is very high - the air system is very noisy, the sound of the train moving, conversations around.  However you don't have to adjust the volume of your music - it sounds just as good.  You take the headphone off your ear to compare, and grin like a loon at just how quiet they are!  I've stood next to a locomotive waiting for the train to open in the station, and using my phone sound pressure level app discovered that the noise is between 95 and 100 decibles - that's really loud.

"first, let's talk about shipping is amazing fast! I order it a day before Thanksgiving and it arrived today noon, a day after Thanksgiving. so the shipping rate is amazing. it wasn't thanksgiving it probably arrived yesterday.
( it may take longer in different places, I'm from NYC )

second, this battery grip is made by Canon, so it feels and matches the body identical. if you are wondering how is feels about the quality, then you should go ahead and grab the grip on your DSLR. the feeling that you get from it is the feeling that you expect from the battery grip. (mine is Canon 50D)

* This product comes with a 6 AA battery tray so no need to spend your money to get it. the battery grip is made in Japan.

Installation is easy, takes less then a minute. plus it has an instruction in it. after installed it my 50D looks a lot more professional but camera with the grip plus a Canon flash, it feels a lot heavier. but i can deal with it, and it is not that a big deal.

over all good product and i would recommend it",5.0,0

"The Good:

The Cathedral top looks nice and the design is comfortable. The Bad:

The bottom is too small for the most typical desktop, but if you're a 4'2"" person, it's not too large. If you are going to use it for a full sized kitchen, it's a good idea to get a larger one. The Frigidaire top is great, but I wish there was an additional design. I think the design is better suited for small kitchens, but I'd be happy with the Frigidaire version.

It does a good job of filtering the water but even a new filter is so slow! And you have to fill the upper container twice to get it to 2/3rds full. Don't fill it any farther or it won't filter the rest that's in the upper part. It just sits there. When you try to pour it the unfiltered water in the upper part is what comes out first. The upper container needs to be bigger. I think they made it that way so you can try their filter out and then go out and buy their filter that attaches to your faucet like I ended up doing.,3.0,0

-Easy installation, setup guide is well written and easy to follow
-8,000 square feet WiFi Coverage
-Easy to reach on/off switch, it is nice not to have to unplug a device just to cycle power

-Built in Intrusion detection system
-Multiple WiFi amplifiers to make sure you get a strong signal
-Can manage up to 7 additional access points
-Can be used as a Router or an access point
-2.4Ghz and 5.0Ghz WiFi
-Includes a magnetic mounting plate and standard mounting clips

 Cons

-Only has one LAN port, sure you can get a small gigabyte switch for cheap, but that is one more thing to plug in.
-Includes many advances features not needed by the average user which can be intimidating, you are paying for all these features so if you do not need them this might not be the right device for you.
-expensive

Not having at least 4 LAN ports is a big negative for me given the price tag, but I think I might be able to overlook that given the powerful processor and increased range it provides.

Putting on these socks made my feet very happy! Right when I took them out of the package I could feel how soft and well made they were and when I put them on my feet that was immediately confirmed.

I have somewhat small feet (8 1/2 mens) and those one size fits all socks you get in department stores never fit me right.

I plugged it in  and found that it would only heat to about 130. Then a thin line of smoke came up from the iron. I returned it and Amazon promptly sent me a new one. With the wonderful reviews I've seen here I was confident that the this one would work beautifully!  Sadly this one wouldn't get hot enough either!  It put out a good amount of steam but only heated again to about 130. I tried ironing a cotton garment  and it just wouldn't get all of the wrinkles out! Let me assure you, I followed the instructions in the manual to the letter! The second one went back too. I got a quick refund. Despite the great reviews I just wasn't ready to try my luck on a third! Very disappointing!
Update: I very much appreciated Spectrum Customer Service reaching out to me. I contacted them and they sent me a new iron. Sadly this iron performs about the same as the others. I checked the temperature of the soleplate when set on ""linen"". The temperature was in the 130s in some areas, high 120s in others. My research shows that an the temp should be about 235 on linen, 204 on cotton. 135 is good for nylon, acrylic , spandex. This iron puts out good steam and will get mild wrinkles out of cotton (when set on linen) but won't remove a crease. It won't get linen completely smooth. This is 3 out of 3 Allure irons that won't get hot enough.

"Should have done this long ago. It replaced my Mr. Coffee electric chopper.  This unit fits nicely in my hands.  I like the sound of the beans being crunched in the mill.  Yes, it takes a while.  I haven't timed it.  It's not burdensome.  You can walk around while you grind.  The directions are in English.  A helpful hint is to hold the handle in place while adjusting the grind.  Counterclockwise for coarse.  Pinch a bit of coffee and you'll see that the beans are evenly ground.  It's a fine piece of equipment.  The plastic top is such a good fit it's not easy to pry off.  That's OK!  No complaints!  I use this with my AeroPress.  Great combo.  Next I will try roasting my own.",5.0,0

"This is a wonderful product.  I love the feel and feel of it, and the screen is very bright.  I've used it on my Galaxy Note 4, and it is pretty nice.  I would highly recommend this product.I use this as a dual-core GPU for my HTPC.  I have the most recent version of the 3.1.4 driver installed.  I installed it via the app on my HTPC, and it works well.  The GPU uses a dual-core 1.4 GHz processor, which is slower than my previous dual-core CPU.

"After recently ordering a new pair of headphones, I decided to purchase a pair of the Denon.

I had a pair of Denon earbuds before, and I wanted to go back and purchase them.

I was skeptical about the Denon's functionality, but after seeing a few reviews on Amazon, I decided to give it a shot.

I plugged it into my computer, and I immediately noticed that the Denon was connected to the Denon's HDMI port.

The Denon seems to be working, and I was able to enjoy the audio and videos, and the Denon's HD was a breeze to use.

The Denon's audio quality is amazing, and the Denon's HD is excellent.

I had a Denon 3D headset, and it sounded great, too.

The Denon's audio quality was very good, and the Denon's HD is great.

"This is my 4th Panasonic video player, (two DVD, two Blu-ray) and each seems to get a little better than the one it replaced.
I bought this particularly to get a high quality player that still had analog audio outputs, as there appears to be a trend by manufacturers to end support for them in favor of only an hdmi and/or digital audio connection.  I leaned toward this because of reviews, and since I have had Panasonic equipment for a while, and have been satisfied.
The DMP-BDT500 plays a few discs that were not readable by an older Panasonic DMP-BD60 that I bought when I first made a shift to blu-ray.  I think it was the last firmware update that caused a problem with some discs in my collection.
I have to ding it one star for the remote.  As many other buyers noted the touch pad is not all that great, but may get used to it with more use.  A traditional remote with a multi-function directional 9-key pad would have likely made more sense, but I've only used it a few times so far, and I have a few other panny remotes that I can use with this player to get around the touch pad remote.
I have this paired with a Panasonic TC-P60ST60 plasma, and can only say the picture is phenomenal.  I plan to upgrade my audio to an AVR or separates with 7.1 channel surround next, but analog audio out from the player to my old AIWA stereo worked great once I realized I had them connected to the wrong RCA connectors for the 2 channel audio to work properly.",4.0,0

Very nice case.  Solidly holds my iPad with ease.  My only complaint is the screen is a little hard to read.  The case is designed to be easy to take off and on with no problems.  Just be aware that this is a thin case and it will not fit perfectly.  It will not fit the iPad properly.  I have not tried to use it with any other case but I guess I am not sure if it will be an issue.  I will update if I find another one.I bought this as a replacement for my old version of the iPad.  It works perfectly.  I have used it a couple of times and it has never stopped working.  I have never had a problem.I bought this to replace my old Sony DSLR and it was a steal!  It works very well and I'm happy with the purchase.  I love the features and the price was right.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a quality product.I love this case.

"This is a great product if (a) you want wireless capabilities with your MP3 player (I don't-but that is another story)and you want (as I do) a player that will work with the Rhapsody subscription service.  Ipods are wonderful, but you still have to shell out a buck for every song you want to download.  Rhapsody has a flat rate, so you can download music that you might not take a chance on with Itunes.  The player works well with Rhapsody and I hope to get it up to the 5,000 song level I had with my old Dell DJ.",4.0,0
"REVIEW REFERENCES the ""Wireless"" Unit:

Pros:

1. Connectivity is rock-solid and it took about 5 minutes to set up a new secure network. Smart devices in the home easily jump between this network and the old one in different wings of the residence.
2. Linksys is a company I trust because my Linksys router has been working non-stop for 8 years without a single problem. I expect their networking equipment to just work and it does. Always.
3. This unit is so smart that you can switch which outlet it's plugged into by yanking it off the wall and plugging it in somewhere else. It will remember all of your settings and reboot itself in under a minute. This is great for experimenting time when you want to see which room/outlet gives you the best reception/range.

Cons:
1. Nothing major, but note that structural walls will degrade your signal slightly; and that's going to happen with pretty much any wifi product you buy.",5.0,0

"I purchased these China storage containers for my son's third-grade science class. I was excited to find these in the box. The containers are clear, and the cover is very sturdy. I have had no issues with the lid sticking out. I would recommend these to anyone looking for a way to store their own electronics and toys. I had to order one of these to use in my kitchen. It works well and seems to last for quite a while.",5.0,1
